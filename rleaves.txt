critical aspect lives often overlooked i think creative pastimes important allow us truly engrossed process they stimulate sides brain like nothing else helpful thinking unique solutions daily struggles life i career focused i would also try find programskillhobby used leverage knowledge experience field for example i recently started teaching self dataanalytics software called essbase sound boring its boring activities actually boring  sign boring mind life perspective sure cast everything sounds confusing difficult boring worth but accepted mundaneness eventually learned love dataanalytics unaware using large volume data multiple sources derive patterns therefore conclusions these conclusions used market firms product service effectively less resources this increases enterprise value firm overall leads profit while may look data put right away spend enough time learn interpret becomes extremely fun its fun like solving puzzle fun it stimulates brain forces think critically use analytical part brain also leveraging creative side if right everyone else company going make money job security im saying love dataanalytics of course it example casting aside potential career building activities  fun silly i think find ideal industry put effort specializing aspect calls much better you  passionate  disregard without giving fair shot are it  know code want

times brainnot use much energy something done repeatedly   nowsomething new never done  like driving grocery store house  across everyone yards driveways knocking bushes trash cans   but kept driving thru everyone yards would knock bushes tamp grass pretty soonsmooth path could drive  this brain works use well worn neural pathways  we always making new pathways unlessregulating brains thru drugs alcohol stimulants etc paving old habitsnot anymore lost interest  you actually see mris fascinating stuff now brain designed seek pleasure avoid pain conserve energy motivational triad  so whatever seek pleasure repetitive behaviors becomes one well worn pathways brainsnot use much energy repetitive habits   it easy keep going back habit brain knows seeking pleasure conserving energy stay alive lot us say  i dont want keep smoking i  well  your new neural pathways sober going take bit time get inculcated let call you 20 literally updating operating system   branding addictive personality

i believe a guide quitting weed leveling life i  forum almost month i think i contribute community this idea guide quit weed i hope helps least one person i  want offend anyone thoughts matter i means trying force views i sharing ideas here goes like everything life quitting weed one point view you take one philosophy say  correct way ways incorrect  every philosophy advantages disadvantages focus one likely make mistake ignoring disadvantages focusing advantages  late find relapsing angry want try there different aspects view idea quitting weed addiction matter  psychological philosophical physical social visual each connected way basically one big whole look whole different points view i share thoughts aspects moment these ones i think others right i job correctly able think factors first i would like accent fact eliminate idea duality everyday life the idea duality think something always create  internal debate  thing thinking believe least two ways view for example think quitting weed one part thinks  weed bad i must use  immediately another part thinks  well  bad i mean least 1 positive weed i  smoked much obviously has something good  this creates internal struggle pick one side stick want think everything make sure right thinking subject matter  making mistake now imagine internal debate emerges every time focus thought feels overburdening  in order remove concept duality must acknowledge accept idea everything one smoking weed smoking weed need label bad good one whole thing if focus one part label good bad create duality hinder progress the things i write may hard understand intellectually logically practice start gain understanding i sharing this something i picked zen philosophy would like know i suggest read book  zen mind beginners mind  shunryu suzuki psychological aspect ntwhen want quit weed make sure understand idea wanting quit if really want quit make decision live day day if understand afraid relapsing want smoke even option when say  i want smoke anymore  stating  something want  even somebody says  dude let  get high come bro i got big bud etc   matter consciously made decision want smoke similarly internal  popup  smoke  matter ultimately want smoke anymore do understand i  saying  you want smoke anymore smoke small internal though made think smoking you wanting to smoke smoking difference two things what matter think smoking want smoke some people fail admit want smoke fully devoted idea looked every part unified idea wanting smoke exactly easily relapse someone offers joint these people say  i smoke anymore except person offers bud i find weed street i get really stressed etc  this concept duality  want stop smoking want stop smoking going succeed either one things philosophical aspect ntyou realize stop something done long time life change ways one when stop smoking might noticetthat longer watch tv every night 10pm think life differently perfectly normal change find enlightenment understand life changes every single day paying attention recently senses numbed  care life way  care change enough notice accept everything happens life try rationalize understand every single detail accept understand fully you always make life better put mind need relapse cope change with time practice philosophy gets easier physical aspect ntwhen stop taking substance  using body going react beginning this called withdrawal also something going pass you might experience sweating diarrhea anger etc know change body making bear every minute  suffer  bringing closer wonderful moment longer feel pain changed something life  case stopped smoking there ways reduce pressure transition  physical activity green tea cranberry juice meditation try  help  hinder progress social aspect ntwhen decide  want smoke anymore change definitely going notice way communicate people going change you may think  i fun person i  smoking   i  get nice someone person annoys much i  smoke  the change communication also something like  hey person pleasant company i  high much time  it important understand people different criticize something others support others indifferent whether someone talks kindly harshly idea something react you must accept fact people different function it necessary words affect want affected visual aspect nta good way help support change lifestyle make change appearance that way look mirror apart fact  decided smoke see different changed person i  talking new hairstyle dressing style less fat bigger muscles etc something changes way look easier accept  changed constantly changing so far i think much i hope information helps understand life bit ultimately level life if found guide helpful way give   vote post comment people see  irather stand 0c sit
