Some notes and encouragement on meditation from someone who has meditated for nearly 20 years.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/85u18y/some_notes_and_encouragement_on_meditation_from/,2018-03-20 20:25:06,"So I've seen some people expressing frustration with mediation here on /r/leaves -- in the words of /u/tommybahami123: 

>*""It’s kind of tough in the sense that I get distracted while attempting to clear my mind or everything.""*  

And from /u/jonny070389: 

>*""I’ve just given up on the meditation, my mind just goes off on crazy tangents.""*  

So as someone who has meditated for many years, and credits meditation with making my life an easier place to live, I thought I'd pass along my thinking on it.  (thanks to the Leavers above for the inspiration to write this.)

To me, saying *""I've given up on meditation because my mind goes off on crazy tangents""* is like saying *""I've given up on working out because my heart rate goes up and I start breathing hard.""*

Your mind going off on crazy tangents is exactly what you meditate to experience, and beginning to learn how to guide  those tangents back to peace is exactly what you're there to learn.  

*Everybody's* mind goes off on crazy tangents. That's why mediation is something you have to learn how to do, and why learning how to do it can take a long time.

My first suggestion is that you begin meditation with an attitude that it's something you are going to *experience,*, not something you are going to *do.*  Saying that it's something you are going to do makes it a job, or a chore, or a skill you feel you have to develop, and that's more than a little ambitious when you're just starting out.

My suggestion is that you sit quietly in a comfortable position, in a darkish but not pitch black room, and set a timer for ten minutes. 
 Tell yourself, ""That voice in my head is always yammering away at me -- for the next ten minutes I'm going to listen to it.""

Then, just sit quietly and listen to it.  Try not to guide it, try not to make mental notes on what it's saying, try not to tell yourself you'll have to remember that for later, just sit quietly and listen.

Then, when the alarm goes off, go on with your day.  If you can, try not to process what you heard -- don't think, ""wow, I really obsessed about work"" Just let that ten minute session go and move on with your day.

Do that for a week.

In your second week, you get to actively choose somthing to help yourself.  Set your timer, and choose something simple and repetitive to concentrate on.  Some people focus on their breathing -- the actual sensation of air moving through their nose or throat.  Other people count slowly and quietly to three or five in their head.  Choose what makes sense for you.  It should be peaceful and repetitive.

Then, in your ten minutes, let your thoughts rest on that repetitive idea.  *""<inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale>""* or *""<one...two...three...one...two...three...>""* whatever you chose. 
 You will, nearly immediately, lose control of that, and your chatty thoughts will intrude.  When that happens, simply think quietly -- ""those were other thoughts, I want to go back to my peaceful repetition."" And return to whatever you chose.

This losing of focus will happen ten or a hundred times during your session. Quietly guiding yourself back to your repetitive place is what you are there to teach yourself.  Don't get frustrated on how many times it happens, just note it, remark to yourself that it happened, and return you your peaceful repetition.

This is the only task and only work of meditation.  Noting when your thoughts have strayed and returning yourself to peaceful repetition.

I have been meditating for nearly 20 years now, and as you practice your inner thoughts intrude fewer and fewer times, and when they do you are very experienced at returning to a place of peace.

And, as you might suspect, the skills I've learned in meditating begin to extend outside of my meditation session.  I've learned how to be much more aware of my inner dialog, and I'm much more capable of noting what it is saying, separating myself from it, and keeping it from taking automatic influence over my thoughts and actions.

I hope this made sense.  Feel free to AMA if something wasn't clear.

I quit THC cold turkey for 6 months - My Thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/c4udee/i_quit_thc_cold_turkey_for_6_months_my_thoughts/,2019-06-24 23:47:48,"""Weed isnt addictive, I can quit whenever I want.""

-A weed addict, who doesnt understand how addiction works. You'll never WANT to quit.

""Weed ain't never hurt nobody, I've held down a full time job at Walmart for the past 5 years and I'm paying my bills, how can you say weed is slowing me down?""

-A person who is completely content with where they are in life, and lacks any motivation or drive needed to move forward with any endeavors.

Every person, at some point in their life, will come to the realization.. that there is no growth in comfort.
How old you are when you reach that point, is completely up to you.

The thing stoners dont understand is, weed possesses absolutely ZERO short-term flaws. The damage it does to your life happens slowly over time.. and you'll be too high to notice it.

It doesnt ruin your reality, the real danger is how it makes you extremely comfortable in your current reality.

That's why alot of people up here reflect on how they stayed in the same place in life for years because of this habit.  

Weed is a coping method.
You had a bad day? Hit a blunt, you'll feel better.
Long day at work, at a job you hate? Hit a blunt, you'll forget all about it.
You're sober now, time to go back to work at the job you hate, take a pen with you.. you can be high all day and the day will float right by.


When you are sober, you have a fire within you that burns for better at all times. When you are high, you're numb, you're content.

When you're sober at that job you hate, you have the drive to strive for better. You have the drive to push for more out of life.

When you are a stoner, the only drive you'll have, is to make more money so that you can freely dive into the weed habit of your dreams.

I stayed in the same, mediocre spot for 4 years because of how content I was. One time I got a good job, and the hours prevented me from smoking and chilling like i wanted to, so therefore, I was constantly calling in sick so I could have that time to smoke and chill. 

This is why many successful people say weed is a luxury for those who have already made it to where they want to be in life.

Now I understand why, it's a drug that can keep you stagnant.

If you want to quit, my advice is to ask yourself, how bad do you want more? 
More out of life.
More from yourself.
This drug doesnt serve you, and it never will.
Right now.. you are a slave to your mind, and your mind is a slave to this habit.. that makes you mentally weak. Are you content with this? No? Then keep reading. 

All you have to do, is have the balls to acknowledge that you have a problem, and simply.. take back control.

Have the balls to take back control of your mind.

Have the balls to take back control of your body.

Have the balls to take back control of your time.

Have the balls to take back control of your LIFE.

No one can do this for you, only you can.
Realize shit like this is supposed to be tough, if this was a perfect world.. everyone would be free. 
But despite whatever cozy, comfort bubble your weed habit has put you in.. the world is not perfect, and this is not going to be easy.

Personal battles like this are what separates the mediocre from the great.


Just ask yourself, do you want to stay who you are for the next 5 years? 
Or do you want to strive for greatness? 

You decide."

99% of the time we meet we smoke. Sometimes he brings sometimes I bring. But we almost always smoke. It's what began our friendship. 

He told me he has new rolling papers for me. The transparent ones that I like.  

I told him I stopped smoking 2 weeks ago in an effort to better myself but don't mind he smokes.

A second later he texts me saying he totally understands. 

We met. He smoked. He didn't offer. I didn’t ask for a puff. I am still 2 weeks sober. 

It was fine. 

We are still friends.

Even better friends than before"

what my life looked like tonight: call my dad soon as i get off work. pick him up and take him to get frozen yogurt. help him navigate the place. crack jokes, get laughs. pay for his frozen yogurt while he holds it excitedly, like a little kid about to get a special treat. drive him home, sit with him and eat together watching his favorite tv show. 

didn't have to rush to get high, didn't have to emotionally avoid. so much more time, so much more emotional capacity and clarity.

dont get me wrong: sobriety is hard, like all the time, but worth it. "
Quit Any Bad Habit INSTANTLY Without Willpower,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dlnai8/quit_any_bad_habit_instantly_without_willpower/,2019-10-22 23:48:07,"# Quit Any Bad Habit INSTANTLY Without Willpower

📷

**Quitting bad habits is EASY, you've just been using the wrong method!**

Normally people quit a habit using willpower, but willpower is a limited resource.

When we rely on willpower we encounter ego-depletion - We lose all motivation to keep fighting and give in to our raging craving.

For example:

When you first quit, you can do well for a few days...

Then you start to think *""Maybe just this one time""* or *""I've been good, I can just do it a little""*.

And you give in.

But don't worry, **THERE IS ANOTHER WAY:**

Using this strange method, I have quit alcohol, sugar, binge eating, smoking, porn and procrastination.

As a result I have lost 70 pounds, found a girlfriend, quit all medication and I wake up with a smile on my face.

Here is the method:

1. Meet your Addiction Voice (AV)

You bad habit or addiction has it's own voice, the AV.

The AV wants you to give in to your cravings, and works by hijacking your inner monologue.

It will say things in your own voice like *""Why don't you just smoke one more time, it won't do any harm!""* or *""You need to smoke, or you will get grumpy and damage your relationships.""*

The truth is:

**Everything the AV says is a lie to get you to give in to your bad habit.**

2) Learn to recognise your AV

Your AV can be brought to light by making The Law.

The Law is unbreakable, and doesn't require any willpower to follow.

Does it require willpower for you not to steal a car or rob a bank?

NO!

The Law cannot be broken at any point.

Write down your law if it helps, but the most important part is defining it.

E.g. ""I will never smoke again"".

But how can this help you recognise your AV?

**Because any thought that pops in your head that contradicts the law is the AV, not you.**

3) Create an AV Avatar

Assign an avatar to your AV.

For example, my smoking AV was an old, ugly man who chain smoked and had cancer.

Whenever I'd hear him say *""Go on, just have a quick one, it can't hurt!""* I'd say ""Screw you old man"" and give him the finger.

This also helps with cravings.

**Cravings aren't really happening to you, they are happening to your AV avatar.**

Your AV Avatar wants to give in, not you!

Without you giving in, they will disappear and die!

Your true self is already free of this addiction, so the cravings aren't happening to you, they are happening to your AV.

Extra tips:

* NEVER NEGOTIATE. If you keep playing with your AV and trying to argue, you will just end up giving in. AS SOON AS YOUR RECOGNISE YOUR AV, SHUT IT DOWN.
* Make your avatar ugly, not friendly. They are the scum of the earth. My binge avatar was a pig - not a cute little one, a fat smelly, warty one.
* Always remember, your AV cannot make you do anything. All it can do is speak to you, you don't have to do what it says!
* Your cravings and voice will disappear faster than you realise, but NEVER let your guard down.

Now go out there and kick your AV's ass and say goodbye to your bad habit!"

You should break up with weed if,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g17dts/you_should_break_up_with_weed_if/,2020-04-14 19:16:57,"You love it so much that it's all that you think of right after waking up.

You have been getting high each and every day of your life, for many months or for many years.

Your whole life is centred around getting high.

You first get high even to do your mundane tasks.

Your life has narrowed down to enjoying only when you are smoked up.

You are always thinking about your next dose even after getting high.

You have tried moderation, but very soon, you are back to your old self.

You become irritable, bad-tempered and fearful when you are going to run out of your stock.

Your closest buddies are the ones who indulge in weed or other substances.

You only go out if there is weed involved.

You go to work but in the background, you are always looking for your evening or night with Mary Jane. Or you go to work after getting high. Or you manage to get high even in the middle of your work.

You clearly have come to the realization that weed is affecting all the possible domains of your life.( physical, mental, financial, spiritual, relationship with the loved ones/ the opposite sex, social skills, work and career, hobbies, passions, personality or character)

You have a feeling that you are living far below your true potential and calibre. ( Trust me, if you feel that, it's QUITE THE TRUTH!)

Your every day is kind of the same, like riding in a Ferris wheel.

You tend to think about sober life and all the better things you could be doing after getting high.

You have become tired of that specific, fleeting, only partially satisfying, very familiar type of high that only downregulates with time.

You mostly pass out in your bed after getting high and exhausted.

Weed makes it OK,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gurdsd/weed_makes_it_ok/,2020-06-01 23:40:01,"
-Weed makes it ok for you to go to bed without brushing your teeth. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to pig out on junk food (and not clean up the mess).

-Weed makes it ok for you to spend money you should be saving. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to live a passionless life. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to live in isolation. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to not clean your room. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to forget your goals.

-Weed makes it ok for you to turn your head away from the real source of pain. 

-Weed makes you think you’re OK. 

Chronic use of weed made these and many other detrimental behaviors seem OK. There was no problem, so long I had some flower to smoke. 

You have a choice, and even though it might seem scary, even though you might think “how am I going to live without weed?”, once you make a choice for yourself, a choice to be happy again, you will thank yourself later. 

Don’t give up, it’s much brighter on this side- I promise. 

** Remember- it’s not weed’s fault, but rather your own choices.


EDIT: Wow. Thank you so much for all your support everyone. It makes me very happy to know that this helps many of you out there. Keep on believing in yourselves, you are not alone. ❤️ Also, please remember this is from my personal experience, everyone is different. ❤️❤️ Much love, and stay happy."
My wife threw it all out,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i7qgvk/my_wife_threw_it_all_out/,2020-08-11 15:56:59,"It was the end of the day. We had just put the kiddo to bed. Typically this is when we would head outside to light up, but I was 5 days into sobriety, so she was doing that alone. These early days have been tough because I know I could just go with her. 

My plan was to turn on the baseball game and dive into some code for a side project. Went to turn on the game and it was blacked out. I became unreasonably angry at this. I felt helpless, like I couldn't even distract myself from my cravings.

When my wife came back inside, I was ranting angrily about it. None of this anger was directed at her but my aura was not fun at that moment.

I went down to feed our pets, angrily grumbling to them. Came back upstairs, and I saw my wife going back outside. At first I thought I fucked up and needed to go out and apologize for being overly mad about something as stupid as a baseball game. 

I couldn't be more wrong. She came inside with what was left of our stash. Went straight to the bathroom and dumped it all in the toilet. 

""We're doing this together"" she said. 

I hugged her and cried into her shoulder. I know this decision is hard and I didn't want to make her give up her vice just because I had chosen to. I was so overwhelmed with love at that moment. She prioritized me, and that meant so much. 

Day 6 today for me. Day 1 for her. I feel so much stronger and confident with her at my side through this."

It was an ultimatum . . . a line in the sand of sorts.  This rattled me to my core and was just the impetus I needed to finally break this chain of addiction once-and-for-all. I’m 41 years old and I’ve been smoking weed off and on (mostly on) since I was 15. I quit drinking and smoking cigarettes many years ago. Marijuana, however, has proven to be my toughest chemical crutch to hang up for good. I’ve been trying to quit for 11 years now. I’ve quit for over a year on three separate occasions, only to  be lured back by this most seductive drug. Even though my parents encouraged me to drink and smoke from a very young age, I take full responsibility for my actions at this point in my life. Enough is enough. I’m determined to give my wife a completely sober, present husband. I’m determined to give my kids a completely sober, present dad — which is something I never had as a child. The cycle of addiction ends with me. I’m doing this for them, yes, but, first and foremost, at the end of the day, I’m doing this for myself. 

“I’m a healthy person. I don’t smoke weed anymore.” 

This is my new mantra. I chant it silently while I meditate. I chant it while doing Yoga. I chant it on my daily, early morning runs. I chant it before and during any activity that I used to associate with smoking weed. And, in doing so, I’m truly beginning to believe it. 

I’m determined, more than ever before, to finally nip this thing in the bud for good. 
Pun intended ;) 

This wonderful community of supportive folks has been absolutely invaluable to me. So glad to be a leaver instead of a stoner. ( Day 11 )
Big love, friends. ❤️

Edit: 
I am overwhelmed and humbled by the outpouring of wisdom, encouragement, and support from complete strangers on this sub. I have tears in my eyes as I write this because I am so deeply moved by all this genuine kindness. Thank all of you so very much! Based on some tips I’ve received here, I’m changing my mantra to, simply, “I’m a happy, healthy, sober person.” It makes sense that, psychologically speaking, saying, “I don’t smoke weed anymore” can have a negative connotation to it since it emphasizes something lost rather than something gained. I’m set to gain (and keep) soooooo much by sticking firmly to a path of sobriety and that’s exactly what I intend to do....what I WILL do!

Also, today I stopped by both of my stoner friends’ houses individually and made it very clear to them that I do not smoke weed anymore. I was completely honest with them about why, without being judgmental in any way towards their choice for continuing. This was a very big deal for me and something I’ve never been able to do before in the past. It’s a game changer. They were both extremely supportive of and encouraging to me. One of them, my longtime best friend, to my great surprise, even opened up to me and showed interest in also wanting to quit for some of the same reasons I mentioned. We plan on starting some healthy activities together from now on instead of just sitting around toking together as we have for years. I’m very proud of myself for the first time in awhile, and so is my wife. I came home from that and playfully flexed my arms and, with a big smile, said to my wife, “I’M STRONGER THAN A PLANT, BABE!!!” 😂 Again, thank you all so very much! I will check in here regularly.  😊🙏

"For the past month I have been meditating daily, working out, stretching on a yoga mat for 20 minutes a night, drinking tea instead of coffee, and getting 8.5 hours of sleep per night and I feel like I have SUPERPOWERS!",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fdo8vr/for_the_past_month_i_have_been_meditating_daily/,2020-03-05 05:22:32,"
I have to admit I feel kind of fucking ridiculous as I type this. It's amazing what dropping my bad habits and replacing them with good habits has done for me. I used to smoke myself to sleep each night with high THC dabs and I would wake up feeling like a train had hit me in the head. I had to have a fucking bang every morning just to get out of bed and I only ate when I was stoned and it was always greasy fast food.

Fuck that noise I am never going back. I love this new lifestyle and I love feeling like a champion every day. No morning brain fog at all, I even wake up early. I'm even picking up old hobbies I stopped doing like reading and training my dog to learn new tricks. 

The biggest realization I've had is life doesn't always have to be so fucking hard. If you take care of yourself it makes every other problem in life SO much more manageable! I feel so much less stressed all the time and I have a much bigger attention span at work. It's like hitting the easy mode button on life. I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it."

First and foremost, it's great to have you here and I'm glad you decided to come to see what we're about. 

Since how we act towards each other is the only thing that makes this place as special as it is I just wanted to take an opportunity for some reminders for newcomers and old-timers alike.

**Who We Are**

This is a subreddit for people who have made the decision to quit cannabis, edibles, or other THC products.  The only people we're not suited for are people who have the intention to continue smoking or return to smoking.  

That includes moderation management, tolerance breaks, ""I just need to get away from it for a while,"" or ""I need help getting through the next few months while my dealer's on vacation.""

It's hard for people trying to quit for good to have discussions with people who are still smoking or intending to start again, so we keep our focus pretty narrow.

**Who We Are Not**

The thing that sets /r/leaves apart from most of the other subreddits is that people come here at what is often the worst time in their lives.  They feel bad and have little love for the world or anyone in it.

So one of the few rules we very firmly enforce is that we are a *support* community.  We are here to help each other, creating an accepting community and a welcome place to be.  I know the rest of reddit can be rough-and-tumble, but that ends at the /r/leaves front door.

Even if you disagree with someone, if you are rude, dismissive, or any other flavor of impatient we will moderate your posts or comments out, and if you make a habit of it we will ban you.  

If you cannot find a supportive way to communicate with people, find a way to disagree with them in a respectful way, or guide people with what you think are wrong ideas in a gentle and understanding way, then you should not comment.

**Dealing With Problems**

If someone is trolling, seems to have missed the point of the group, is soapboxing in a way contrary to our mission, or anything else that might tick you off, **do not comment, and use the report button.**  That brings it to the mods' attention where we can review it. Use the report button early and often, it's really a help.

Again, however, please don't comment.  That just gives trolls more opportunities to keep trolling.

To keep modding from being too crazy we use Automod keyword filters that automatically holds posts relating to some topics for review by the mods.  We review every single Automodded post, but sometimes we can mess up, so if you aren't seeing your post and think it's somehow stuck feel free to message the mods.

**How /r/leaves Works Best**

The point of /r/leaves is many helping one and one helping many.  I know it's tempting to be a lurker, but unless we share our experience then no one has any lessons to learn.

Please post often and comment often.  Just the process of writing out your posts helps you and posting them helps others.  

We now get over **145,000** unique users a month here at /r/leaves so even a small participation can help a whole lot of people.

Thanks very much for arriving here, and we look forward to seeing your progress posts and great stories ahead!

I could recite every canned talking point about the safety of the substance, how you “can’t get addicted to it”, all the negative effects that come from prohibition, and anything else you can imagine. One of my favorite facts is that there has never been one death from blood toxicity of cannabinoids. Other than stupid choices one makes while under the influence, you cannot effectively kill yourself by smoking too much weed. Trust me, I’ve tried. I still consider this to be one of the best attributes of the drug. It’s relatively safe in this respect.

However this fact also has a very dark side to it. You can smoke weed all day every day and still survive. If I had consumed any other substance with the frequency and quantity that I smoked weed, I’d be fucking dead. Full stop. I would be viewed as an addict, I would have profound health problems, and would be generally a degenerate by any reasonable persons’ standard. 

But because I smoked weed I wasn’t an addict, you can’t get addicted to it! I was a stoner. A nonconformist. I lived my life how I saw fit, otherwise I would just be a square. 

I could smoke relentlessly and have no incredibly negative consequences. And I’m the sort of person that needs consequences. I thought that because I didn’t flunk out of school, get arrested, or have any sort of major health problems that I was keeping it together. I was surviving.

But I wasn’t truly living.

Friends of mine graduated and began to do big things. Start business, go to graduate school, write books, get jobs and wives. I sat around watching The Office or Its Always Sunny for the fifth time. I never held a good job, just enough to pay for my weed. I lived at home with my parents. In short I stagnated. I never matured, I never developed positive coping skills, nor learned how to try, fail, and try again. I watched friends and schoolmates build lives and realize their potential. I didn’t truly realize this for years.

If I had had obvious consequences I would have had to face them. But I fell pray to weeds subtle seduction, and faced its cruelest trick. It doesn’t kill you, but it still takes your life. Don’t get me wrong, it’s definitely preferable to be alive than to die by an overdose. But it’s sadder in its own way to live in stagnation than to truly live.

It is the life unlived."
If cannabis was a girl,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bax5ya/if_cannabis_was_a_girl/,2019-04-08 22:17:36,"I wrote this for myself after getting pretty much 0 sleep the first night. It just hit me that my entire relationship with weed seriously resembled a relationship I had with an extremely needy girl.

**So here, If cannabis was a girl:**

When you first met her you couldn't believe how great she was. She made you forget your problems, food tasted better, sex was amazing and even if you were a lifelong insomniac with her you could relax and sleep for 10 hours. WOW. Unlike your ex, miss Alcohol she also just left in the morning. She gave you one more kiss of happiness and said: ""see you at the next party"".

Next few weekends were the same. She just kept on giving without asking for anything in return. You liked her so much that seeing her just once per week wasn't enough anymore. You decided to start seeing her every night. She remained more or less the same but you changed. You feel in love with her so much that you stopped doing your evening activities just to be with her. You dropped an odd friend or two and stopped your healthy diet so you two could enjoy the junk food she likes so much.

After few months, you started thinking that life without her just wouldn't be the same, so you decided to let her move in with you and spend entire days together.

**Now she started showing her true colors.**

She told you to drop more of your friends and family to make time for her and without even thinking, you did. She told you that you aren't allowed to eat food, fuck or sleep unless she is there. You started seeing that this is no longer free spirited, non needy girl you thought she was. 

You tried to take a break for a week just to realize how deep she got her hooks in you. She was right, you couldn't sleep,  eat, or even enjoy a movie without her.

But now you know her for what she really is. You also realize that it wasn't just her fault. You are a needy person that wanted her to be with you 24/7. You thought she was a solution to all your problems, she wasn't. She just made you forget about them. 
Now you have to deal with 20 things at once. 

Good news? Even just 24h after the last contact with her, you start quickly forgetting about her. Sure happy memories come back and tempt you every now and then, but now you know better.

While things are bad, you know that in a week they will be much better, and what's a week compared to a lifetime of wired co-dependent suffering with her? Nothing. I am happy to pay my price and move on. I am looking forward to another sleepless night, these will serve as reminders to stay away for a long time to come. 

Stay strong brothers and sisters, we got this!"

The key to quitting weed easily and permanently,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/girzy2/the_key_to_quitting_weed_easily_and_permanently/,2020-05-13 08:35:52,"Please hear me out and read till the end, this was an absolute game changer for me. The key to quitting easily and permanently really comes down to a shift in how you look at things. If you see quitting pot as this big sacrifice then your always going to have cravings and have to fight these cravings. You need to get to a place where you see quitting pot as a major blessing, see that your really not giving up or sacrificing anything, but instead gaining so much. Most importantly, you need to stop focusing on why you shouldn't smoke weed and start focusing on WHY you smoke weed in the first place, and dispel these illusions. What is it that keeps you coming back? What is it you think it's giving to you?

Most people say, I should quit because, my health will be better, I'll have better energy, I'll have more confidence, I'll be better socially, I'll excel more in my career, I'll be far more productive, I'll have better relationships with my family, I'll feel proud of who I am, I'll be more present in my daily activities, I'll feel more alive, I'll save more money, and I'll have more time to focus on the things that really matter. While all of this and more is true, these things do not address why you are using weed in the first place. Wouldn't it be easy to quit weed if you had no cravings to begin with? Your brain only has limited willpower so if your constantly getting bombarded with cravings because you think your giving up something you value, for any of these positive benefits, then it's a matter of time before you reach a weak moment and your cravings finally take you over and you go auto-pilot.

Therefore the key is to go through every single reason why you use weed and dispel the illusion of these reasons, I'm going to provide examples now of how this looked like for me.

The reasons I used weed and the reasons these were false illusions:

1. Weed makes me more creative: Actually this is not true. Weed disconnects me from my higher self. When I'm sober i'm alot more connected to the subconscious mind and find it easier to bring clarity to the ideas i'm getting from my deeper and more intelligent self. When I'm high I'm vibrating at a lower level, cutting me off from higher intelligence and not giving me the energy to bring my ideas into fruition. I am far more creative when I'm in a happy and relaxed state and when I'm smoking weed, because of the guilt I feel, I'm not as happy and relaxed as I could be, making my ideas and creative output lower in quality. Even the good ideas I do come up with, nothing ends up happening because I'm to stoned to take action on them. This leads to a sea of half baked (no pun intended) ideas that end up going no where. When I'm sober I have far more clarity and can hear music in my head in far more intricate detail and bring these ideas from my head and into materialization alot easier, this is why, the idea that it makes me more creative is entirely false and a complete illusion.

2. It makes me relaxed/is a good way to relax: Actually this is not true. It is robbing my relaxation and peace from me. This is because I know deep in my heart that smoking weed is making me move further and further away from my goals and what I truly want in life. Although it brings short term pleasure, it brings absolutely no peace and relaxation to know that I'm throwing my life and potential away every day I spend high sitting around. Infact, I don't think peace is even possible for me when I'm caught up in the daily smoking of pot. Not only that but every time I smoke I'm robbing my brain of the necessary chemicals needed to provide a natural and long term sense of peace and relaxation. I also find it impossible to eat healthy when I'm stoned, leading me to eating tons of foods that only contribute to anxiety and depression. Everyday that goes by that I waste I feel a nagging coming from my higher self telling me that this isn't the way I want to live, and that I want to quit. I'm not even dealing with the things I need to be dealing with on a daily basis, and am letting things pile up more and more and become more out of control. Because of this, smoking weed actually causes a ton of stress in my life and makes life 10x harder then it has to be. The idea that it brings me relaxation is a complete and utter illusion and nonsense caused by short term spikes of dopamine and in the long run causes tons of stress and anxiety.

3. It's enjoyable/gives me pleasure/is fun and enhances life: Actually this is not the case. It is actually robbing pleasure from me in every way I can imagine. First of all it's spiking my dopamine levels high in my brain, giving me short term, artificial pleasure that plummets when I come down off the drug, only needing more and more to feel any sort of pleasure or happiness. It's leading me to miss out everyday on major opportunities that are going to bring me long term pleasure from the feeling of winning and success in life. Every experience that I'm having in life while stoned, is one that i'm not even fully present for, or fully experiencing. I don't remember 80% of the stuff I'm even doing while I'm stoned. Although it feels fun in the moment, its something i'll look back on in a years time and just see as blank empty space with no memory of the time I wasted and threw away. Is this really pleasurable at all? Is it really pleasurable for me to keep on pushing back my goals and dreams and not feel satisfaction in myself? To not trust myself? To feel guilty everyday that I need a drug to feel any sort of joy or happiness? Of course not. It's a complete illusion that weed creates any kind of joy or pleasure in my life, it's actually stripping me of amazing life experiences where I'm fully present and can feel the amazing joy that comes from feeling naturally alive, healthy, and accomplishing great things in life. It robs me of any true fulfillment and will only leave me with regret, broken promises to myself, wasted time and lost opportunities. So no, this is not fun, this is not enjoyable, or pleasurable or any of the things that kept me using. These are all completely false.

I could go on but i'm sure you get the idea, you need to go through all the reasons personal to you and write out exactly why all those reasons that keep you using are false and a complete illusion. Once you do these properly and see that you actually have so much to gain by quitting weed, and nothing to lose, you will no longer have cravings, or at least much fewer then you would of had. You've now dispelled the illusions that made you think you were ""giving up"" something in your life of any real value. You can see through these cravings and know they are false. Now is when you decide that your done with weed, you will never take ""one toke"" ever again, and that it's something you will never touch again in your life. You must understand your an addict and even one toke WILL put you right back to where you started, there is no moderation for us in this sub, so don't fall for that nasty illusion.

For people going through withdrawal, be easy on yourself, give yourself time, give it a month before you even expect to feel any bit of positivity, and don't get discouraged if your not feeling great right away. Your brain receptors are going to take time, sometimes alot of time, depending on your abuse, to rewire themselves and create your neurotransmitters normally again. Ride it out.

Best wishes."
Great quote that helps me stay sober,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gyzub7/great_quote_that_helps_me_stay_sober/,2020-06-08 18:00:02,"Yesterday, an old friend posted a picture on Snapchat from one of the Humans of NY books, and the quote from the woman in the picture was so profound. 

“I wish I’d partied a little less. People always say ‘be true to yourself.’ But that’s misleading, because there are two selves. There’s your short term self, and there’s your long term self. And if you’re only true to your short term self, your long term self slowly decays.”

I immediately applied this to my quit journey. When I have cravings, I try to remember that my “short term self” wants to get high. But my “long term self” made a decision to quit. This has been so helpful to me not only with weed sobriety but also with alcohol sobriety (that journey started about five weeks before I quit pot). So, when the cravings hit, remember your long term self!

Edit: Can’t believe this post resonated with so many people! Thank you so much for the awards! This sub has had such a positive impact on my life and I want to thank everyone who has posted here before that gave me the support and inspiration I needed. So happy to think I’ve been able to give some of that back to you all. Stay strong everyone!"

A Day in the Life of an Addict.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hty5tx/a_day_in_the_life_of_an_addict/,2020-07-19 14:02:36,"I recently broke my 2 week sober streak by celebrating with a joint after I passed my licensing exam. Here's a recap of my Saturday to demonstrate how quickly things revved up in the 24 hours following relapse. I'm wasting my life away while I'm on weed and I mean that in the most literal sense.

Saturday:10:00 A.M - Wake up and purchase a quarter oz despite telling myself that yesterday was a mistake and that it was just a slip-up. ""We were celebrating!"". Also had to buy papers and a lighter cause I threw mine out the last time I said I was 'quitting'.

10:30 A.M - Had my first joint with a cup of coffee down by the lake. Great start to a beautiful summer day. So far so good.

11:00 A.M - Starting to feel hungry, too lazy to make food. Smoke another joint instead.

12:30 P.M - Meet up with a friend that I hadn't seen in a few weeks (because I wasn't smoking) and we smoke 2 fattys together.

2:00 P.M - Holy shit, I still haven't eaten yet! My stomach is killing me. I finally grab a burger from McD's (cause i'm lazy, remember?)

2:30 P.M - Whew. That was a good meal, shall I smoke another one? I think I will.

4:00 P.M - At this point my room mate came home (They know I'm not supposed to be smoking) so I purposely left the house to get high without them finding out. I shit you not, for the next 2 hours I sat in my car by myself,  getting high. THIS IS WHAT I DECIDED TO DO ON A HOT ASS SUMMER DAY.  I think I browsed reddit and listened to a couple podcasts too so atleast I have that going for me. 

6:30 P.M. - Room mate invites me out to a BBQ. I politely decline because I've been smoking non-stop since 10 in the morning and I'm not even sure I'm alive at this point. Room mate is curious as to why I'm so low energy today, I tell him ""I'm just burnt out, it's been a long week."" Instead I mindlessly played games on my phone for the next 3 hours. DID I MENTION HOW FRICKEN BEAUTIFUL IT IS OUTSIDE?

9:30 P.M - Oh shit, I haven't eaten since 2, lets munch on some Taco Bell. But lets smoke one first.

10:00 P.M - And after.

12:00 A.M - Open up my baggie to see that I only have a nug and some shake left at the bottom. At this point I realize that I smoked a quarter to myself (almost) in one day. I'm overcome by grief and regret, and swear that after this one last  joint, I'm done.

12:15 A.M  - Got high for the ""last time""

3:00 A.M - Browsing Leaves and trying to muster up the strength and willpower to leave this shit behind for good.

&#x200B;

As embarrassing as it is, days like this aren't all that uncommon for me. I prioritize weed over everything whenever I go on these little benders. I'm out here lying to people, starving myself, sitting in my car doing fuck all for extended periods of time just so I can get high.  I can't keep 'living' like this.

Day 0 again. Fuck me."

My brain is damaged, my vision is damaged (can’t see in the dark) my lungs are damaged, my retirement is nonexistent.

Stopping Smoking Weed is Gonna make your life infinitely better and is nowhere near as hard as your stoner-mind will have you believe! Go for it!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fff4d1/stopping_smoking_weed_is_gonna_make_your_life/,2020-03-08 20:45:32,"I found reading the posts here to be helpful when quitting smoking. I figured I’d share my experience in the hope that it might help others in their mission to ditch weed... 

For reference, I smoked for 4.5 years. Daily for the last 3 years. 55 days free as I write this. 

I’ll start with a chronology of what it’s like to quit so you know what you might experience, and later on in the post I’ll write some more about how to get yourself psyched up for quitting and into that “fuck this” mindset! 

Here’s how it went for me... 

Day 1) It feels a bit surreal. 8pm rolls round and your instinct is to seek out some weed and smoke. Resist!!! Do something else - ideally something that will tire you out physically. You might (prob will) have trouble sleeping tonight. But guess what? You’re solid and you aren’t gonna bitch out and cave are you? No!!! Good. Your body and mind are used to being in a chemical slumber when you fall asleep. Tonight your mind is drug free and it feels like your thoughts are going 100mph! Don’t worry, it gets much easier. 

Day 7) You’ve been having crazy dreams because your body is re adjusting to having proper, healthy REM sleep. Your mental and physical ability to regenerate and repair is already much better. You’ll feel much sharper mentally. Because you’ve been smoking weed chronically, you begin to realise how much it’s been holding you back and feel like you’re the fucking guy off limitless, working at 120% capacity hahaha

Week 3) Up until this point, you’ve been painfully aware of the fact that days feel like they’re 40 hours long. You’re coming to the realisation that normal people (aka non weed addicts) actually do stuff like sit and watch TV on their own, go to the gym and then go to bed. Up until this point, you’ve been looking at the calendar daily wondering why only 1 day is passing when each day feels like 3. 

At this stage, you are realising with a crazy sense of “wtaf” how insane the concept of smoking weed every single day is in a cult of weed smokers. You realise how strange your defending of weed and weed smokers must have sounded to non-stoners. 

Week 4) At this stage, you are elite non-weed smoker and are basically out of the woods. You stop doing the weird calendar-watching and stop caring about how long you haven’t smoked in. You have absolutely no desire to smoke weed anymore. You might find yourself around people smoking weed again at this stage but have the ability to say no. It feels great. 

Week 7) You now realise that by not smoking weed, you have lots of spare time. You are much more efficient and motivated to do small jobs and engage in productive activities such as working out and attending clubs etc. You also realise you are about £100 better off every single week which is the equivalent of getting a 5 grand pay rise at work... tell me that isn’t a good incentive eh!?

Here’s the secret: 

The difficult part of quitting is getting yourself to a place (mentally) where you are 100% ready to leave weed behind and move on with your life. 
The whole NOT smoking the weed bit is actually surprisingly easy!

For me, the hardest part was psyching myself up for D-day where I was gonna quit cold turkey. It seems like the scariest idea at the time but once you do it, you’ll realise how little you actually had to worry about! Go for it!

Once you are in the frame of mind where you’re ready to leave it behind... you are in the drivers seat and in total control of your weed-smoking behaviours! 

Conversely, short term, ‘knee-jerk’ attempts to quit are destined to be exactly that - short lived and doomed to fail. 
These can be disheartening, however, like cig smokers and any other form of addict, it often takes a number of failed attempts before a successful attempt is made. If this is you right now... persevere! 

You need to understand that YOU and ONLY YOU can stop smoking. Nobody else is gonna do it for you. 

I used a bit of a self-hatred and asshole approach to help me quit. 
Every time I thought about giving in and smoking, I’d tell myself off. Am I really so weak that I will give in? I’m not addicted to heroin I’m trying to stop smoking a non-physically addictive drug here. Be realistic about what it is I’m trying to achieve. 
Think of the insane feats human beings can achieve under crazy stress and shitty circumstances. I have no excuses if I’m to bitch out at this. 

My close friends at the time (who are also heavy weed smokers) continued to smoke. I forced myself to completely avoid them and the weed-smoking environment because I knew it would be much easier if it was out of sight & out of mind. 
To them, I seemed like a dick on my tee-total high horse completely avoiding them. They would send me messages and photos smoking and try to encourage me to join them once more. I got the “cold shoulder” a bit as though id decided to turn my back on the cult. As much as part of me wanted to cave and re-join the safe, familiar environment - I resisted. The saying “misery loves company” is extremely relevant here. Me and my friends were validating each-other in our unhealthy weed smoking habits. 

I turned this negative into a positive.   
While they approached my abstinence with a “haha bet you really wish you were smoking weed like us right now” attitude, I would tell myself that I AM better than them with each passing day I didn’t smoke. 

I wanted to think: 
 “I’m missing out because I’m not smoking with them” 

but the reality is: 

“they are missing out because they are continuing to smoke” 

They were too weak to have the bottle to give it up. I wasn’t. This sense of strength and accomplishment felt great and encouraged me massively to keep going. 

The sad thing is, they didn’t want me to smoke with them because they missed my company, it was more about validating their bad habits. If we all did it together it wasn’t quite as bad! 
I’m happy to say that since then, one of my friends has since had a very similar epiphany much like mine and also packed in the smoking. This I’m very glad of. He said my decision to stop made him look at his own habits and realise how unhealthy they were impacting his life in his own unique way different to mine. I don’t have any resentment towards them as their behaviour was just a projection of their insecurity and desperation to be validated in their weed smoking. We’re still friends and I just don’t smoke if I’m around the ones who do now. 

Now for an overall thought... forgive me if this is a bit deep. This is just my perception and way of rationalising my decision to stop. 

I’m a strong believer that life is what you make of it. Every one of us has the choice to smoke weed or not to smoke weed. Ask yourself what kind of people smoke weed habitually? Is that the person I want to be? In my case, the answer is no. 

Is it making my life better or worse as a whole? Objectively ask yourself. 

We know that poor and disaffected people tend to have these kinds of destructive habits and ultimately they’re doing them to escape something. Whether this is poverty, a shit job, shit social support system or whatever, that’s the general consensus. It’s the same for hard drug users and the majority of alcoholics. How many successful happy people with beautiful wives and holiday homes in the alps sit in the dark and smoke weed for 6 hours a night? Virtually none. Ask yourself why...

The sad truth is that the most vulnerable people who do these things find it the hardest to break this cycle, but by stopping the destructive habits and investing time and energy into fixing the broken parts of your life - you have a much higher chance of being happier than if you continue down your dark spiral of substance misuse and self loathing! 

If you’re constantly hard-up and/or unhappy with the way your social life is (much like I was/am to an extent), smoking weed all the time is like shooting yourself in the foot- big time. 
Successful, healthy women (if you’re a guy) are uninterested in you because you’re a sad stoner in their eyes, no matter what way you perceive yourself. If you keep it a secret like I did, then you’re leading a fkn double life and it’s like having a secret mistress who you have to make time for on the side hahaha.
If you’re poor, spending your last £100 on weed and cigs seems like a reasonable idea. Multiple small releases of dopamine in a sad reality beats sitting at home bored with nothing to do. My advice is to reinvest your time and cash other places and the rest will slowly begin to fall into place. 

The rich non weed smoker with his holiday home and white picket fence house may well be in that position because he is much more lucky and privileged than you or I. By smoking weed chronically, we widen the gap between him and us. By stopping our destructive habits and reinvesting our time and energy other places, we can (to some degree) level the playing field and also have happy, productive lives.

I stopped smoking weed and spent the spare money on a gym membership and starting climbing. By doing this, I’ve automatically given myself a massive personal identity change. I’m now the gym goer and climber, not the sad weed smoker who has nothing going for him! 

Sorry if this is a bit long winded. There are other things I wanted to add but didn’t want to ramble (any more than I already have). The last part is my perception of reality and might not align with how you lot see constant weed use. That’s totally fine. Some people can use it in moderation and others still stand by it and defend it to the death. I’d say to them... try taking two weeks off and see if you still feel the same about your habits. 

You’ve got this in the bag. You are much stronger than you give yourself credit for. It’s a mental battle and you can win it with a bit of self efficacy and determination- go for it!!!"

- wrote up a schedule for the next week
- worked full time while doing all these things
- haven't eaten any junk food (interesting how that becomes so much less of an issue when I don't smoke)
- hung out with a coworker who's girlfriend recently broke up with him and he has been a little lonely recently

Having off today helped me get through a lot of that studying, but apart from that these are things I would have probably avoided or half-assed had I been smoking.  I made it my new goal to not smoke this month of July (taking an exam in August) and my brother just said ""Why not just wait until after the exam?""

Then I thought to myself ""Why not wait until I'm satisfied with where my life is?""  So new goal, no more smoking until retirement ;)

Jokes aside, I feel amazing right now and I'm going to continue writing down what I've gotten done and what I plan to get done in the future, leaving no time nor desire to smoke.

So, fellow members of /r/leaves, what have you accomplished since you quit? And what do you plan to accomplish?

Why marijuana addiction can be so hard to let go of,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/grw4hx/why_marijuana_addiction_can_be_so_hard_to_let_go/,2020-05-28 04:46:56,"I'm 1 month sober now, kinda missing pot but also slowly and surely learning how to enjoy things the same way when sober. Here are some midnight thoughts on why marijuana addiction can be so difficult to accept and even harder to let go of :

-When it comes to other drugs and alcohol, the altered state we're in is quite distinguishable. More often than not, you're not in control of your actions, but at some level, you are still aware of them. With marijuana, on the other hand, that altered state starts becoming your **reality.** Most of us smoke multiple times in a day, making the addiction more ingrained in our sense of self.

-This is where it all messes up. Our sober, normal self becomes our *altered self.* Why would you want to do something sober when you can be high and flow with it instead? For example, you want to have pizza but ofcourse you won't have it sober because it's so much better when you're high. 

-The main problem : your personality. I read somewhere that one of the hidden dangers of heavy marijuana use is the **paralysis of personality development.** A big reason I fell in love with marijuana is because of how creative it made me, how much more I could enjoy my hobbies, etc. So I started using it regularly before writing or painting. Again, that's where it all messed up. It went like - more pot = more art, no pot = no art, and slowly just pot and no art. I used to see this as a writer's block before I finally realised.

-We don't realise how covertly marijuana takes over our hobbies, traits and overall personality. We end up never finding who we really are, because we equate ourselves with the intoxicating effects of pot or with the withdrawal symptoms of it. 

-Although I do see how other drugs also block personality development, but the reason this one is so much more difficult to accept is because we never really see it as a problem. We don't see it as an escape from reality, we see it as reality itself. 

Do you all agree? Tell me about your POV on this :)

If you left the cannabis ingesting lifestyle during lockdown - stop for a second and give yourself credit. You stopped at the hardest time possible,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hyetk7/if_you_left_the_cannabis_ingesting_lifestyle/,2020-07-27 01:07:24,"I'm 3m 3d into my abstinence from cannabis after smoking for ten years and for the past year, smoking an oz a week.

Since lockdown started - I realised quickly that working from home wasn't going to happen, I'd wake up, join the call, roll a zoot, bun the spliff whilst I was on my laptop and veg out all day doing naff all.

I'm a professional in the IT industry and smoking weed was my escape, my way of relaxing after work and burying my head in the sand by using cannabis to dampen my emotions. 

My backlog of project work increased massively as I was too lazy to work. I stopped smoking and forced myself to work and stay busy.

If you gave up during this time, just know that it was the hardest time to give up, purely because you have the ability to smoke when working from home without any management or colleagues dobbing you in to HR - they aren't physically there to grass you up. 

Furthermore, we've all been locked up at home, well at least in the UK we were for a fair amount of time. I got bored a hell of a lot more than usual. My responsibilities of commuting, working & shopping changed. I was massively bored for extensive periods of time. I'd usually smoke weed when I was bored and cutting it out was incredibly hard.

If you stopped during these times it says so much about your mental willpower. Keep up the good fight brothers and sisters!"

My dog died because I was high,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ht3rj9/my_dog_died_because_i_was_high/,2020-07-18 00:57:51,"About a month ago, I was leaving my friends house, and I had just took a dab. I had my dog with me, and for some reason I just didn't think to grab his leash when we walked out the door. 9/10 times he would have just walked right to my car. Well this was that 10%. He saw a rabbit, chased it into the road, and was hit by a car. Literally the only car around came at that exact moment. It feels like the universe punishing me for being careless. I feel terrible. That night was the worst night of my life.

 People tell me not to blame myself but I know that he'd be alive right now if I had just been more careful. I can't say for sure that if I was sober I would have grabbed his leash, but I probably would have. I loved him so much and my girlfriend loved him even more, and now she'll never see him again. I fucked up- It was my responsibility to protect him and I didn't even do the most basic thing of keeping him on the leash.

I've been a daily smoker for years, but for two weeks after that I didn't smoke weed at all. But I slowly started again. I feel like smoking helped bring out some emotions that I wanted to repress, which was good, I think. 

I feel like this was a sign and a terrible lesson that I need to get my shit together. But I still have cravings. Smoking weed was how I relaxed. I used to love getting high then playing with him or taking him on a walk. 

 It's Friday afternoon and I just wanna get high. But I know I shouldn't. There's so much I want to accomplish and weed just slows me down.


Idk what the point of this post is. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading

"Weed makes you introspective, which is good (until it isn't).",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g6jtit/weed_makes_you_introspective_which_is_good_until/,2020-04-23 13:46:26,"When I was depressed, weed was a teacher I could not have succeeded without. It helps you see beneath the surface of life, and insofar as that helps you, weed is good.

Now I've seen beneath the surface enough, and I'm struggling to actually live a life in the physical world. Diving deeper is just getting me further from our shared reality. I'm no longer ""learning"", so much as I am imagining things and believing them for a little while until I sober up and life continues. 

There is no long-lasting impact to the things I imagine and believe while high nowadays, so whereas once weed was a helper, I think now it's just a distraction. I just like the feeling of things ""making sense"" for a little while.

Weed showed me a world with colour and feeling to it. For this I'm eternally grateful, and maybe one day I will need its help again. For now though, I think it's time for me to put the herb down and make reality home again.

&#x200B;

There's no shame in having had a habit as there's a time and place for everything in life, even weed. Our struggle is to recognise when the time for it has passed and to have faith that something new will come to fill that dank green hole in our hearts that MJ used to fill. Good luck and God bless all. 🙏"
"I was in 3rd grade, 9 years old, the first time my dad handed me a lit joint.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eu0chx/i_was_in_3rd_grade_9_years_old_the_first_time_my/,2020-01-26 04:56:09,"I’ll be 41 years old next month.
I was in 3rd grade, 9 years old, the first time my dad (who was drunk as usual) handed me a lit joint. I breathed that hot smoke deeply into my young sensitive lungs as I’d seen him do many times. I immediately fell into a severe coughing fit. My dad laughed as if it were the funniest thing he’d ever seen. I remember distinctly feeling ashamed and thinking that one day I’d be a real man like him and be able to hold in that hot smoke. Thus began my decades long interest, fascination, and ultimate infatuation with this plant, this drug. 

I started using marijuana (and drinking, and cigarettes) regularly by the time I was 14 all with my parents approval and even encouragement. By the time I was 17 I could hold my drink and smoke with any man. I thought at the time (as did my delinquent friends) that my parents were  cool for this, but in retrospect I realize that they basically saddled my immature, undeveloped mind with these addictions and, as a consequence, I entered into adulthood at a huge disadvantage. Needless to say, I still carry around hurt, confusion, and anger towards them for this. 

Fortunately for me I met and married a great gal at 23 who made me want to become a better man and basically saved my life. I quit smoking cigarettes at age 25, the morning my son was born. Threw a nearly full pack in the dumpster behind the hospital and never looked back. I continued to drink and smoke weed heavily though. My wife, who has never used any substance, disapproved of my use but was extraordinary patient with me. I guess she saw something in me under all my exterior mess, something I was unable to even see in myself. 

I had an epiphany of sorts on my 30th birthday and, in what seems like a flash of insight, realized with crystal clarity that my health was THE most valuable possession that I would ever own and vowed from that moment forward to take an active ownership in my own health. I was very overweight and unfit and had high blood pressure, a future heart attack in the making. I quit drinking that day and never touched it again. It was tough as hell but next month will be 11 years of sobriety from alcohol. 

I started exercising daily (mostly running and cycling) and changed my relationship with food and went from 220 to 155 pounds in one year and have maintained this healthier weight ever since. 
Marijuana though proved,  and still proves, to be my hardest chemical crutch to hang up for good. I think it’s because it was so deeply ingrained into my psyche from such a young age. Everything just seemed so drab and uninteresting without it. I’ve quit weed many times over the past 10 years (hence my username), several of those times for over 1 year, once for over 2 years. I always seem to manage, though, regrettably, to find a way to return to this long lost love of mine. That’s the irresistible seductive power of this drug for me. I reach a point in my sobriety where I truly begin to feel joy and contentment in life without weed, and then, as if I forget why I quit, I pick it up again, only to quickly realize again why I quit in the first place. It’s a love/hate relationship, an abusive relationship, a viscous cycle. 

Throughout this whole process, I’ve fortunately been able to keep this side of me hidden from my son, who has no idea about this aspect of my life and would be shocked and confused if he were to ever find out. 

Last summer my 14 year old son and I rode bikes (bicycles) all the way across the country from Mexico to Canada, 2,400 miles, mostly on remote dirt roads, along the spine of the Rockies thru the states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It took us 49 days and was an absolutely incredible experience for us both. We carried everything with us on our bikes and slept under the stars most nights. I wanted to show him, among other things, that you don’t need to have drugs and alcohol to have a good time. Something my own father failed miserably at teaching me. 

I hit my one year weed-free mark (again) while on that epic journey with my son and was very proud of myself for doing so because the cravings and opportunity for using were certainly present along the way, especially in Colorado. 

In what was really a sweet and generous gesture, my dad called me out of the blue and said he wanted to make the long 3 day drive to the Canadian border and pick us up instead of us taking the train home as we had planned. It was very nice of him. But here’s the thing, there are many things that trigger my impulsive urge to smoke weed, but none more powerful than the presence of my dad. I strongly associate the presence of my dad with smoking weed and, knowing this, worried that I would be unable to resist the urge during the long drive home. 

It wasn’t 30 minutes down the road when we stopped at a rest area. While my dad and son were using the rest room, I opened the glove box and grabbed my dad’s little tin box that I knew would be there. I quickly loaded a bowl and took 4 or 5 deep tokes and was almost instantly awash with that old familiar euphoric embrace mixed with equal parts shame and guilt. I smoked with my dad at the motel later on that night and again early the next morning and again the following night and morning but haven’t smoked again since. Even just smoking those 5 times brought about a period of withdrawals for me. . .anxiety, depression, etc. It only left me wanting more and more and more and MORE! Moderation for me, simply isn’t an option. Once is too many and a thousand times isn’t enough. 

I’m sitting here now with 6 months of complete sobriety and, though I do still think about and crave weed, I generally feel pretty good and have definitely reached a place where non-chemically-stimulated joy and contentment have returned to life. The addicted mind is a sneaky little persistent bastard and I feel now more than ever before that I’ve finally managed to wrap my hands around its slippery little neck and put it out of its self-induced misery once and for all. :)

If you’ve made it this far thank you for allowing me to share my story. Believe it or not I tried to keep it as brief as possible and left a lot of stuff out. I should write a book. ;) 

I love that folks from all backgrounds and walks of life can come here to this great community to give and receive encouragement and support to one another no matter where we happen to be in our shared struggle to break free from the chain that binds us. Much love and stay strong, friends! ❤️💪"

This was a big moment. I stood with it in my hand, feeling like I was on a hidden camera show, being tested by the universe. I pictured myself at home, sitting on my back steps, smoking. 

Then I threw it away. In the trash. A full joint. IN. THE. TRASH.

Thanks to you all.

Edit: 
I want to answer some questions that I've been asked about my journey thus far:

I started smoking weed when I was around 20/21, and by the time I was 23, I was a pothead (I'm 30 now). I abused marijuana because I was depressed, lost and confused about my life trajectory, and wanted to numb the pain I felt about my career, and my family dynamics. I ruined many MANY relationships due to weed. I was not a thoughtful or present friend, and I went through long periods of time feeling lonely and misunderstood. I struggled with how to maintain my relationships, I couldn't keep up hobbies, my mental health tanked and I continued using weed to numb the pain.

I knew that I had to quit smoking for about 2 years before I actually did it. I was always bargaining with my addiction and trying to find a way, any way, to keep the high going. I cheated on urine tests (don't ask), stole from people, lied to get high.  Last April I hit rock bottom because at that point I had been smoking before and after work, and my performance suffered as a result. This also triggered further negative self-talk, and I smoked even more in order to cope. Finally, I was terminated due to an overall shitty performance, and I was RELIEVED because I knew that this was as bad as it could get and I had to make a change. I smoked my last J on April 7th 2019. 

The road to recovery sucked for a long time before it got better. I have had brief stints of sobriety (no more than 3 months) in the past, but always went back. This time I was so desperate for change that I found myself in NA/MA meetings, reading self-help books, meditating, changing my social circle. Just anything to get over the hump. I downloaded ""I Am Sober"" so that I could hold myself accountable (highly recommend). I knew that if I could just get to 6 months, I could get to a year. The normal withdrawals were there at first. I remember during the first few weeks having this....hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. It wasn't hunger...it was just emptiness. Emptiness at my core that I normally filled with weed. Waking up and not being able to fill that was incredibly hard to face. I cried a lot. and I also felt all of the anger, disappointment in myself, resentment, and sadness that I had allowed myself to ignore over the years. 

Getting clean didn't make me or my life perfect. I am so imperfect it's hilarious. But I am self-aware and I have the drive to improve as much as I can. I can feel emotions, I can feel bored and be ok with it. I can exercise, meditate, keep my space clean, and perform well at work without looking for a ""treat"" like a dog. I'm a grown ass woman! These are things that I'm supposed to do! I don't need a treat for getting up and handling my f*cking business. Idk I've just leveled up as a human being and I appreciate it. 

Someone asked if I crave weed anymore. No. The truth that I didn't want to face was that it hadn't felt ""good"" to smoke weed for a long time. In fact, it was starting to suck. I didnt like how I felt at all. I didn't like how my day would be gone as soon as I lit up. The problem was that I was so stuck in the web that I couldn't get out of the habit, so I convinced myself that I liked it. 

If I could give any advice at this point, it would be to please keep going. You went however many years of your life before that first toke surviving and living JUST FINE without weed. You don't NEED this. Not to be happy, not to be social, not to find a movie interesting, not to eat, not to fuck. Remove the veil and take a closer look at who you really are inside. Also, relapse is a part of the journey. Don't hate yourself for slipping up. Get back on that horse and don't look back. Forgive yourself for your past mistakes and love yourself enough to know that you deserve the best that life can offer. It's not over for you! As my dad says: There's never a happy ending in the middle of the story, so keep on living!"

The pitfall of being “weed happy”,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ex6a4s/the_pitfall_of_being_weed_happy/,2020-02-01 16:42:05,"Here is what I have discovered in my stepping away from cannabis. When I would smoke, getting high was always the same. It was a predictable and familiar experience I call “weed happy.” Weed happy doesn’t change, it is always the same experience, and no matter what else is going on, when I smoked I just got weed happy.

Since stepping back from cannabis, all other forms of happiness emerge. Some are much more difficult to achieve, but the joy experienced is powerful (like the joy of finishing a long week of work, or even the joy of waking up the day following a day of intense craving, but choosing not to smoke). 

Whenever I used to smoke to celebrate, the organic joy of whatever I had accomplished vanished, and I was just weed happy again. 

Understand that weed happy is a very specific, very narrow type of joy, and other greater deeper happinesses are out there, you just have to work harder to get them. But trust me, they are worth it."

Excited for the THC to finally be leaving my body.

Instead of smoking I now go out for evening walks, workout twice a day and eat healthily. 

I also have managed to stop drinking beers. The first week or so after I stopped smoking I seemed to be replacing it with a few bottles each night. Had only a few beers total the last 2 weeks.

All in all I am feeling so much better and highly recommend anyone lurking here wondering whether to try stopping or not to give it a go. I wish I had done it years ago!

Replacing pot with cheeseburgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ictcgp/replacing_pot_with_cheeseburgers/,2020-08-19 22:29:21,"What if everyday you couldn't wait to get home to eat cheeseburgers?  While you were at work, you thought about the cheeseburger you couldn't wait to eat later.  You ate cheeseburgers while you did mundane tasks/chores to make them more enjoyable, but that just prolonged the task bc you were also eating a cheeseburger.  When you went to watch a sunset or to the park, you thought cheeseburgers would make this so much better, so you brought one along.  Starting up a movie? let me prepare my cheeseburger real quick so we can have it while we watch.  You shared your cheeseburgers with others, ""Hey want some?"" Many times you had a cheeseburger before bed too bc you thought it helps you sleep.  You snuck away from family/friends at parties to have your cheeseburger.  You avoided and missed opportunities to meet up with family/friends because you were too busy eating cheeseburgers. You spent hundreds of dollars per month on cheeseburgers.  You worried about not having enough cheeseburgers for later when you got low.  You felt kinda sick after eating them all the time, but you also felt scared about your life without cheeseburgers.

Nothing against cheeseburgers but I think it's pretty fair to say that consuming cheeseburgers in this way would be unhealthy...

I was irritable all the time, I was unhappy and slightly depressed. I didn’t want to talk to people, didn’t want to really do anything ‘valuable’ like study or workout.

Then weed comes back into play... boredom turns into ‘if only I had some weed’ or ‘it would so nice to smoke and do nothing right now’. Your brain TRICKS YOU into remembering all the good times you had smoking.

So what did I do? I made up a lie that I needed to go back to university to get some work done, and that I’d be back in a week. I wasn’t coming here to work, I was coming here so I could smoke again. I went out of my way, and had my parents drive me over an hour, just so I could smoke.

I won’t lie to you and say I didn’t mean to do this. The whole time I was on the way here, I was so so happy I could smoke again. I was fucking IN LOVE with the idea I could smoke a spliff again.

And you know what? It fucking sucked. I’ve been in a hole for two days, smoked 3 grams that was meant to last me a week in a day and a half. When I was high I found myself depressed, anxious, paranoid and everything in between. The feeling of ‘why have I done this?’ came back immediately.

And there’s the lesson. Addiction will literally have you LOVE the idea of doing it again, just one more time. Reality sets in and you’re back to square one.

Day one again for me. I’m going back home after two days because I know I will make no progress here. I am so so scared that in a week I will want to smoke again and lose my motivation, but here is proof that’s the wrong decision."

"Day 7,306: I'm Subduction, founder of r/leaves, and today marks 20 years free of cannabis, alcohol, and other drugs. I wanted to contribute some thoughts on anniversaries, and I'm happy to stick around today to answer any questions and chat about whatever you like.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8z46m0/day_7306_im_subduction_founder_of_rleaves_and/,2018-07-15 23:14:58,"Hey everybody!

For those who don't know me (or know me only from getting mod notices!) I founded r/leaves seven years ago, and have had the best front row seat imaginable as each of you grew this sub into the kind, supportive, and wonderful place that it is.

My official quit date is July 15th, 1998, which is the day that I entered the Smithers Rehab Center in New York City for outpatient treatment. I spent just over a year there and I credit my experience at Smithers with my sobriety, and many of the things I learned there are built into r/leaves.  

So, what are my pillars of recovery?  What are the SEVEN SECRETS TO KEEPING YOUR SOBRIETY! NUMBER SIX WILL AMAZE YOU?! 

There are, as you might imagine, so many after 20 years, so I spent a little time in the past few days trying to think of the answer to the question *""If you could only tell people one thing, one piece of advice to help them keep their sobriety, what would it be.?""*  

After a good amount of thought, I think it's: 

>***""One day at a time isn't just a mantra or an encouragement, it's a concrete strategy.""***

I see so many posts here on leaves like *""How can I possibly quit for the rest of my life?""*

The addiction community is full of sayings, and one of them is *""don't look up, don't look down.""*  A lifetime can feel unachievable, so it's a temptation to never start.  Or, as your day count increases it can feel unsustainable and tempt you to give up. 

So don't quit for a lifetime, don't quit for a month or a week.  Just quit for today. Promise yourself that no matter how bad it gets, you simply won't smoke today.  If it's awful and it makes you decide that you never want to quit again as long as you live then that's fine, but you still aren't going to smoke today.  You'll start up again tomorrow.

Then, tomorrow morning, promise yourself again.

Keep your scope achievable.  There are no points for difficulty -- if you make it through a day without smoking you win.

Does it work?  Well, the only thing I can promise from my personal experience is that although I have no idea what tomorrow will bring, I can promise it works for at least 7,306 days.  :-)

I'll be around for the rest of the afternoon and evening to chat about anything you're curious about -- thanks everyone for making this the place that it is.

Do NOT use will power to quit weed (How I quit),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/c3be7o/do_not_use_will_power_to_quit_weed_how_i_quit/,2019-06-21 18:40:34,"To quit weed we need to change our mindsets around the substance, fighting your way out of the addiction with willpower is a futile method of quitting because it is a limited resource.

Our brains are hard wired to seek pleasure and avoid pain, therefore, if you are fighting your way through your addiction with willpower it sends messages to the brain that it's pleasurable to smoke weed and painful to quit. You can fight for days, weeks, maybe even months with this method but there comes a time where you end up caving in.

Your saying to yourself no I can't have that joint, I would really love a bowl right now but I cant, don't smoke weed, don't go out and buy weed etc.

 The alternative is, instead of fighting your cravings, when they arise just say to yourself ""I'm so happy that I am now someone who doesn't smoke weed"", ""I'm so happy I no longer need to waste money on something that ruins my physical and mental health"", ""I'm so happy that I can now have real growth and progress in my life"", ""I'm so happy that I now have more then enough energy to get things done and am feeling great"".

This is associating pleasure with not smoking weed and pain with continuing that cycle, now your brain is on board and cravings will lessen. Also always make sure to observe your cravings instead of wrestling with them. The second you start getting in that inner dialogue with your brain like yeah I'm happy I quit but 1 toke wouldn't hurt, don't react to that thought, just observe it and let it pass without judgement"

Truly profound thoughts on the world, society, creativity, ideas, spirituality etc. 

How long does that last? What's the outcome after all those thoughts? For me: Nothing. Just more smoking and more thinking without any action. I'm sure there are many people who can function remarkably well smoking everyday, without any negative consequences ... but that is not me. 

I sat at around 21days sober for the first part of December. The festive mood around Christmas and being around other smokers, i decided to end my streak. I was quickly back at smoking 4 times a day, waking and baking etc. I'm so disappointed but i want to pick up the pieces and start again...

At the height of my sober streak i cleaned out a cupboard in my bedroom that i have literally never sorted out for more than 10 years. I never used the cupboard for 10years cos it was unusable because it was full of clutter. That is absolutely stupid when i think about it, but my stoner mind was never bothered about getting down to it... cos well video games, Netflix etc. 

There's a childlike feeling that comes from sobriey/abstinence. A child never feels happy because of a substance. A child generates happiness from experiences. 

I remember a sober day towards the end of the streak.. i had had a great workout. Weights. Cranked out 5 intense sets. Energy levels were returning. The Witcher was playing in the background... i was buzzing. Felt like a man again for the first time in i dunno how long. That same child like natural high. 

There's probably so much more that weed/addiction costs us, than meets the eye.

"Weed absolutely wrecks your reward systems, making smoking the only truly rewarding thing in your life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4w3s6p/weed_absolutely_wrecks_your_reward_systems_making/,2016-08-04 13:49:22,"Marijuana has a powerful effect on a persons reward system. Now, this is not apparent if you smoke once or twice a month, or maybe even a week, but the reason we are all here is because we can't do that. Most of us here are 5 times a week + smokers. Many are also wake and bakers, who can't remember the last time they went more than half a day not stoned. 



The only real problem with weed, and I'm honestly gonna say there is not many of them, is it wreaks havoc on your ability to enjoy life without it. How many times have you said ""I'm gonna get high and then..."" only to not do it and usually end up high on your couch for the rest of the evening? 



This is because your brains natural rewards system, which increases feelings of happiness and contentment, is being heavily compromised by marijuana. Usually the things you smoke to escape from are actually not bad things. They are things that are actually important in life, such as your studies, career goals, or general things that NEED to get done.



All marijuana does is force you to live in the moment. Now this isn't always bad, but when the moment subsides you still have the same issues as before only now a day has passed and you are potentially in a worse position than before.



Marijuana has a time and place for sure. It is a beautiful drug that can deeply enrich a lot of experiences, or open a newfound appreciation for things we take for granted. However when used in excess, just like MDMA, alcohol, cocaine, or other drugs its effects can be devastating.



The thing with those other drugs is that they are rather destructive, and you usually can't go long as a daily user without your life collapsing in some aspects. Weed doesn't do that. Weed can create the illusion that everything is fine and youre content, but what you've really done is lowered your standards for your life.

Although marijuana does make experiences better, how many of them can you actually remember? At the time the movie seems amazing, the music sounds heavenly, a simple walk in the park may be euphoric; but when you come back to reality, how much of this benefits your future self?


Personally, I've found the only way to get over the desire for weed is to cut it out entirely. The problem with using weed as an amplifier is that that becomes your new norm, and life's occasional monotony becomes overwhelming without the crux of marijuana to entertain you.



Life isn't meant to be 100% fun and happy games all the time. A lot of the time it's fucking boring and mundane. Work isn't meant to be fun. School isn't meant to be fun. But it's rewarding. Compare the reward to choosing between a salad or burger for dinner. The burger will be instantly rewarding, like marijuana, but may make you feel badly afterwards. The salad on the other hand will be something that could benefit you in the future, like school, like work, you eat it because of an overarching goal.



The best way to get over weed is to not have it. If you set aside a day every weekend, or second week, or even month; that is still your reward, and subconsiously you are looking forward to that more and not living in the moment.

When I say moment in this context, I don't mean the high moments we have all had, but rather living with a clear view of your future goals and making the most of any opportunities that are presented before you. The moment is beautiful, life can be beautiful, but it's work, hard work. The hard work isn't forever though, its a lot of initial effort to get to where you want to get to, and then that becomes the new norm and youve entered a new state of being; a new and better you.

One of the best motivators to quit weed is to sit down and make a list of every time weed has adversely affected your life, compared to its positive. You'll find weeds positives are limited to food tasting good, some funny chat's with friends, and the occasional moment of drug-induced epiphany. These aren't tangible or real experiences, and they don't really serve to enrich your life in any way. Sure, they can be fun, but real things like exercise, study, learnt skills, and romance are things with actual value to your life.

Really sit down and write down every time weed had a negative impact, every time you didn't plan as well as you could have because you were high, every time you broke a promise to your significant other or family about smoking, every time you missed out on an opportunity because you preferred to sit alone by the dim light of your TV while you ate pop tarts and watched Family Guy.



Don't smoke, just don't do it. But don't sit around home being sad, go out! Join a gym, learn martial arts, go running, learn to play guitar. Do one of the many, many, MANY things you can still do while you're young and have time. When you really start living in the moment, you'll realise how much little time we have in the day, and how precious each second is.



Weed has a time and place, but right now it's not for you. That's why you're on the page. LIVE!"

And I fucking made it. I was so proud.  I made it a year and a half even, before I decided to try some edibles while I was in Colorado over Christmas break.

It was fine. It was pretty nice actually.  I brought the rest of the package home.   I used occasionally and it wasn't a problem. It was pretty enjoyable actually.

A couple months later I moved in to an apartment with my girlfriend.  I had said that I would try smoking again when we had our own place.  We were staying at my mom's house for a few months before that.

We got the place and I've never been so happy. We went and bought some bud (legal state) and celebrated.

It was pretty nice.   But it started to get out of hand really quickly.

All the willpower I had built up from quitting two years ago went down the drain and I started using every day after work , and eventually even during the day sometimes and before work.

My point is that I don't know if I can ever go back or do this in moderation. I thought I could, but I quickly went back to old habits.

I loved being sober. I built my dreams.  The things I do and have today exist because of my sobriety. And now I want to get back to that.

But it is very hard.  I'm back on day three now of quitting   and it sucks. I'm very irritable. I can't focus on my work.

Why you need to quit smoking cannabis - A note to myself,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gaw8f4/why_you_need_to_quit_smoking_cannabis_a_note_to/,2020-04-30 18:02:51,"Why you need to quit smoking cannabis - A note to myself

I wrote this for myself but decided to share since we are all in the same boat. It’s a collection of my thoughts on why I am quitting and quotes that motivate me to stay sober.

-When you smoke it you want to keep using until there is none left

-You continually seek cannabis even against your best judgment.

-It zaps your motivation to study

-Your contempt with yourself where your at and don’t strive to improve 

-It makes you dull and tired

-You socially distance yourself from friends family and ultimately new experiences 

-It costs lots of money / that money could be invested 

-Your personality ends up being built around it
-You miss tons of social and travel opportunities

-A high life is a unfulfilled one

-A man is someone who puts others needs before his own. Can you say you do that when your high all the time?

-Your less alert and unable to make clear decisions.

-You neglect the health of your body

-You neglect hobbies 

-Your best self isn’t dependent on a substance

-You get too comfortable. Remember comfort Is good in moderate doses, but being uncomfortable/facing adversity is what helps us to grow. 

“Purpose over pleasure” -Wes Watson

-You aren’t present enough to have a feasible or profitable side hustle 

-You neglect spiritual growth

-“Pot makes you okay with feeling bored and it’s when your bored you should be learning a new skill or discovering a new science. If you smoke pot all the time you may look back and realize you never made progress with anything.” South Park quote

-It messes with your weigh and appetite.

-It’s not a source of true happiness. 

-It masks your emotions

You don’t need it
It’s going to be hard
Your brain is going to try and trick you 
That temporarily pain will go away
The temporary pleasure is not worth it
Please do not smoke

You could always smoke again. Weed will be around forever. The thing is though, YOU won’t. No one is going to hold a gun to your head and force you to smoke. It’s all on you... Because of that, the key is to stay consistent in your thoughts of why you quit. It’s YOUR attitude and YOUR commitment to being disciplined that will drive you to your goals, not weed. Don’t fall for the illusion of comfort you think it’ll bring.

Your time here is NOT guaranteed and you cannot afford to be distracted the way cannabis makes you.

You will need reminders some days. Maybe often. But it’s about consistency and discipline. 

If your life was a movie, what would the hero of that movie do? Do that! -Joe Rogan

Do you see a full length film about you sitting in the closet and getting high all the time? Or would it be about overcoming struggles, providing selflessly for those around you and striving for personal growth each day? 

“Be stern on self, kind and compassionate to others” - Wes Watson

Don’t become complacent once you make progress. Remember why you quit and refer to this often. 

—————————————————————

I went on a 60+ day bender after getting to 134 days clean. That “just one more time” immediately evolved into a daily habit. IMMEDIATELY! I’ve smoked daily for about 7 years now and it’s time to get my act together.

Honestly this go around has been much harder for me. I’m having a much more intense withdrawal this go around.  I’m nearing the end of day 4 and I am feeling slightly better but the first few days were hard.

It’s doable though...

REMEMBER WHY YOUR PART OF THIS SUB.

It’s time to use this time in my life to get disciplined and go after my goals in life. It’s never too late for that.

It’s crazy. To the people around me I’m so ‘high-functioning’ that they think I’m silly for trying to quit. They say ‘why? You have it all under control. It’s like your glass of wine at the end of the night’ but deep down inside I feel like a daily smoker cannot be functioning at their full potential. 

Anyway. Long story short. This is why I haven’t been able to quit fully. When I don’t smoke I think I’m depriving myself from some sort of treat that I am deserving of. And, when I do smoke I feel like I’m depriving myself of a better lifestyle. 

I only post this here because I see a lot of members saying things like ‘you will quit when you really want to.’ But sometimes I ask what about those of us who don’t ‘want’ to but maybe should?

You’re wasting precious years in a hazy cloud blindly seeking pleasure while avoiding responsibilities and personal growth.

The situation is a 10/10

Weed helps you escape from reality and numbs you to your problems. Had a horribly long and stressful day at work? Don’t worry a couple bowls later you’ll be feeling dandy. Had a major fight with someone close to you and feeling shaken up? Smoke a half gram and you’ll forget all about it in no time. That numbing effect is perhaps one of marijuana’s most desirable qualities. However, that same effect also numbs you to the fact that you’re an addict and you’ve lost control. It numbs you to the fact your life is going downhill. That your relationships are suffering. That your memory is deteriorating. That your vitality is fading. That you haven’t been your true self in years. That the path you’re on is dark one with the bitterest of ends. 

Smoke if you want to. Tell yourself things aren’t that bad. That quitting can wait and you’ll get to it when your ready. Just remember though. You’re under it’s spell. And I assure you , the situation is a 10/10"

So, I have about a month or so before my next semester and figured if I am going to smoke, it should be now while I am out of school (also they random test at my school because we are in the hospital). 

Today, I smoked and it was blah. I zoned out, my conversations were dull. I felt genuinely apathetic about most things that crossed my mind. I noticed my heart rate increased and I actually felt less relaxed. I didn't really enjoy eating (which I expected to be enjoyable). I felt a bit dizzy and frustrated that I chose to smoke. However, this has been a lesson for me in my journey. Weed still sucks the life out of me. It is not cool or fun -- it drains me of my personality. I'm better off without it in my life.


So, if any of you out there are helped by reading this, that warms my heart. Tomorrow will be better for me and smoke free.

Quit smoking 5 years ago. You might think it's a never ending struggle but it's not.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gjmxao/quit_smoking_5_years_ago_you_might_think_its_a/,2020-05-14 18:02:20,"I thought weed was going to be a part of my life forever. When I quit, I thought the struggle of not relapsing would be part of my life forever. I was wrong in both cases. It takes time but the struggle gets easier and eventually there is no struggle. Right now it's as if I never even tried it once. I can hardly remember the high anymore. I can hardly remember the urge. I can't remember the anxiety of smoking and not smoking. It's all history."

So after dinner I go upstairs and his family is hitting their little vape thing. This brought me for a ride as I sat there and watched them not wanting to be rude. His dad offers it to me and I said “no thank you” impulsively because I knew that was my new answer. And then I realized what had just happened. For the first time in 5 years, I said no to the thing I have never said no to before. I know I don’t deserve a gold metal or anything but I was really proud and I went to the bathroom and started ugly sobbing  because I could not believe what just happened. Just wanted to share :) still a bit in disbelief honestly but it was bittersweet and then just amazing. Best high I’ve gotten in years is knowing I’m getting better.

One whole year since I posted about quitting. What it’s like now.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gx57mk/one_whole_year_since_i_posted_about_quitting_what/,2020-06-05 18:06:17,"Today marks one whole year since I posted about my first day here. What I have noticed in one year...

One year ago I posted this. I had my first NA meeting and was going clean. It’s been one year free of pot and alcohol. 

I was a daily smoker. Loved it. Never an excuse not to smoke. I took a year off from my high stress job and filled my days with clouds of smoke.

The first few weeks and months were the hardest because you have to get used to living your life without that crutch. I used to work my ass off knowing I would have that smoke at the end of the night.  Nothing beat that feeling of taking my joint on the deck, lighting up and melting.

The first week was restlessness and anhedonia. I waited everyday until it was early enough to go to bed and then stared at the wall. It felt like wearing an itchy wool sweater. That’s how uncomfortable wearing my own skin was. I couldn’t imagine not smoking with every activity. Softball, snowboarding..running. I couldn’t imagine not having that with a smoke for the rest of my life. It was scary thinking of how will I do that. I carried around a Just For Today keychain in my hand as a security blanket for the first month.

I joined a lawyers support group and that really helped as I went through the 12 steps.

Now....

I’m so much happier. I used to think weed helped me with anxiety. The opposite is true. Weed creates the very anxiety it cures. Since quitting, my mood is way more balanced and my mental well being has improved dramatically. My job is litigation so it’s stressful. What’s different is that I can manage it without going off the deep end.

I’m way more active and present in my relationships with my friends and family. I no longer retreat and ignore calls when I’m high. I’m actually there and it feels good. My social anxiety is far lower.

I really got into snowboarding and nailed 17 days on the hill, mostly by myself getting my ass up at 5:00 for fresh tracks. It was hard because I always used to smoked a joint on the lift.  Sometimes I still miss it. I would never have been able to do this while high all the time.

What I noticed about my getting high before is that the most enjoyable part is the full joint, the light and the first puff. That was the best part. Actually being high.....much less fun. My journal from the year before I quit had so many entries of me saying “you don’t even like when you get high”

My favourite part is the feeling of being free from the cycle of smoke, high, anxiety, smoke, high.  My life used to revolve around that next joint. The next activity was planned around when that next joint was. I’m free of that cycle. I have energy for meaningful hobbies.

There are some smoker friends I don’t see as much anymore. My decision to get sober cost me the love of my life. He is a heavy drinker and when I got sober it was a change our relationship couldn’t handle. He is a wonderful successful person with many talents but as a sober person, being with someone who drinks a bottle and a half of wine a night and loves to party is not the right fit for me. It makes me sad that I no longer see the relationship for what it once was but now that I see it for what it is, I can’t unsee it.

People ask me if I will ever go back to having a smoke once in a while. The answer is no. I don’t have control over my consumption. One is too many a thousand is never enough. If I have one,I’ll rationalize once in a while and then from there to once a week, and then once a night and I’ll be back to regular habits. I’ve run my relationship with marijuana into the ground. The best thing I learned in meetings is that if you have to work at controlling or monitoring your consumption, your already past that point of having control.

I made the decision to quit alcohol as well. I was never a solo drinker but I didn’t want to get out of one trap to fall into another. Quitting alcohol was harder socially because drinking is everywhere (especially in law). After a while people just stopped asking me if I wanted a drink. When I go to events I have Diet Coke in a wine glass. I certainly feel uncomfortable when I’m the only one it drinking at a heavy drinking event but my discomfort won’t be solved by consuming ethanol products. It will be solved by being ok with being me. Still working on it. The only one who really gives a shit is me. No one else is really that interested with their own lives to care.

This post got quite rambley. However, just over a year ago I stumbled here, out of curiosity if my consumption was problematic or not. I kept coming back and reading and the more I read the stories of people here the more it started to click that something in my life wasn’t right.  

Thank you r/leaves. To those who lurk late at night reading and thinking if this applies to them, keep reading and talking. The rest will come."

What weed did for me: it lowered every bar.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/b691tl/what_weed_did_for_me_it_lowered_every_bar/,2019-03-28 00:08:44,"Now that I have some time behind me, I realize that what I liked about smoking is what actually did the most damage to me in the long term -- t lowered every bar.

* It lowered the bar for fun
* It lowered the bar for friends
* It lowered the bar for food
* It lowered the bar for dating
* It lowered the bar for funny

It will take any shitty person, place, or thing and make it feel like a steak dinner.  But it wasn't a steak dinner, I was just living a shitty life and taking a drug to make me okay with it.

Now my life is getting better, and getting better for real.  I'm not sure because it's an unfamiliar feeling, but I think I might actually be happy every once in awhile.

My pros list for quitting weed:,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gxowz2/my_pros_list_for_quitting_weed/,2020-06-06 14:57:35,"I’m only on Day 15 but I have no interest in ever partaking again. None! I’ve attempted to quit many times before during my 26 year habit. 26 YEARS, GUYS !!! This time feels truly different, though. My perspective has changed in a profound way. A complete mental paradigm shift has occurred. Unlike previous attempts to quit, I do not feel that I’m losing something in any way. I’ve so much to gain from breaking this chain of addiction and everything to lose by returning to it. May, 22 is not my quit date. IT’S MY START DATE. It’s the start of a happier, healthier, more meaningful and fulfilling life. Quitting (or rather, starting) is the best decision of my life. Here is a list of some things I stand to gain by committing to sobriety.

- A better relationship with my wife
- A better relationship with my kids
- Increased mental clarity 
- Becoming more articulate (no longer embarrassed during intellectual conversations with others)
- improved memory 
- Improved sleep
- Increased energy 
- No longer feeling the shame and guilt that comes with having to hide my drug use from my kids
- More present with my wife and kids
- Increased patience
- Reduced anxiety and depression 
- Increased mental stability 
- No more paranoia
- More self respect
- No more mindless munchies
- Easier to obtain and maintain a healthy body weight (because it’s easier to control my caloric intake) 
- Increased physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual fitness
- Increased lung capacity (no more pain in my throat and chest)
- Better able to cope with stress ( More likely to actually deal with problems and stress instead of just getting high)
- No more treating those around me badly because I’m coming down from THC
- More patience 
- Better physical appearance (no more dark circles under my eyes or embarrassing redness in my eyes)
- Able to confidently look people in the eyes
- increased sex drive and stamina 
- Not having to worry about running out of pot
- Not having to worry about how and where I’ll smoke while on vacation 
- Much more money in my pocket( No longer wasting money on wasting myself) 
- Learning how to enjoy simple pleasures in life without needing to be high
- Improved concentration
- Increased self-confidence (from being able to overcome this insidious drug habit)
- More able to continue with self-improvement in other areas of my life
- More free time to explore other, more healthy activities and hobbies (running, Yoga, meditation, reading, for example)
- Feeling more in touch with a wide range of emotions and moods ( instead of constantly trying in vein to suck “happiness” thru a pipe)
- More able to experience and feel REAL HAPPINESS 
- Performing better at work
- No longer rushing to get away from non-smoking friends and family to get home and smoke 
- Good moods don’t expire as high wears off (Good moods can last all day)
- Always able to respond if necessary when an emergency arises (There’s nothing worse than taking a child to the emergency room stoned out of your mind)
- More able to inspire other people in my life to improve themselves (That feels so good)
- Feeling less apathetic about things
- More able to look at what is actually making me unhappy in life and work to improve myself instead of just lighting up as a temporary  solution to my sadness

I am not providing a cons list for quitting because for me  it doesn’t exist.....

I could go on but I’ll stop there. I hope this helps. Weed is so damn overrated. You all can do this. You really can! You all deserve to have a happier, healthier, more meaningful life. 
Big love, friends. ❤️"
Weed is a trap,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/806oyu/weed_is_a_trap/,2018-02-25 22:18:00,"Weed won't kill you but it will kill who you could be. It's easy to forget that emotions we become some numb to are feedback. They tell us when we are uncomfortable and they push us to overcome whatever situation we are in. Weed makes us comfortable with being uncomfortable. That shit job you are stuck in? Don't worry about it. You can smoke and chill out right after your shift is done.That huge test you are studying for? You're really stressed out. Maybe a little toke will make you more focused.


All weed really does is freeze you in time. The world will keep spinning and your peers will progress through life while you live the same day in a smoke filled haze. Isn't it better to feel emotions? Isn't it better to cherish the boredom you feel that motivates you to pick up a guitar, go to the gym, or otherwise be productive? Think about all you could've accomplished if so much time and money weren't spent on a disassociating from the real you.


Weed is the most dangerous drug in the world because of how safe it is. It takes the potential of all that you could ever be and makes you content with what you are. It's sad to think I've felt much more human and alive these past few weeks than I have these past few years of daily smoking. I'm angry that I've let myself be okay with a mediocre life but I'm putting everything I can into changing that. 


Stay off the weed, if you fall off the wagon get right back on it. There's much more to life than getting high!

This single idea changed my whole mindset on marijuana and helped me quit for good.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ed60wf/this_single_idea_changed_my_whole_mindset_on/,2019-12-20 09:02:27,"When trying to quit, I had such a negative connotation on weed. I thought it was the biggest issue in my life. If I solved this issue, everything would be okay. I was in a constant loop of relapsing for 2 years straight. I hated marijuana, yet I kept using daily. I finally discovered that weed wasn’t my problem. It was my solution. I used this compound to try and solve the other problems in my life. But weed doesn’t solve anything, it just numbs the pain. Once I changed my perspective, something clicked in my head. Weed wasn’t ruining my life. I was ruining my life. Maybe there are more people who need to hear this, weed isn’t your problem. It’s your solution. Once I found alternative solutions to my actual problems, I was able to quit."
How my eyes have changed since quitting,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g0indl/how_my_eyes_have_changed_since_quitting/,2020-04-13 17:10:37,"I've always found progress pics really motivational and I was looking for a way to include that in my quit, so I took photos of my eyes. 

To me, there's something almost eerily different about them now, between day 2 and day 42. There's the obvious parts: the skin around them is less purple and sunken, the whites are much whiter, they've lost that permanent glossy haze. But there's just something else that really made me want to share. 

[My eyes on day 2 vs. day 42](http://imgur.com/gallery/YxbJ2iC)

I've never felt more proud of myself than I have looking at this picture. It sounds lame, but it almost looks like there's more soul in them.

Maybe it's just me seeing it, knowing how much of myself I've gotten back. Maybe it's the lighting. Maybe there's some science behind it. Maybe it's just hope. 

Whatever it is, I know I made the right choice, and I'll keep making that choice every day.

Edit: The top photo is a tad less focused than the bottom, but I still see huge differences. For anyone wanting to do their own eyeball progress pics, definitely double check that it's focused right on the iris!

Edit 2: Thanks so much for the silver and the kind comments! And as another disclaimer, I know these pictutes are not exact. I did everything I could, but there are differences in the lighting and sharpness. I saw the biggest difference in how it felt to make eye contact with each. The top picture is of a dead-eyed stoner. The bottom picture is of me."

Y'know what's so great about being sober? You can just do whatever tf you want,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hqep2q/yknow_whats_so_great_about_being_sober_you_can/,2020-07-13 16:51:26,"Man I cannot tell you how many times I've had to skirt around making plans, cancel plans, or just never do anything because it would take several days to figure out how to time getting high enough to do stuff with being not so high that I couldn't do stuff but also not so sober I didn't wanna do anything and only for as long as that small window of time between them or else I'd be stuck out needing to get high or getting high and being too high to keep doing the thing. Such a shitty cycle that just kept me basically stuck in my room and made my whole world so unbelievably small.

But I'm sober now. I spontaneously caught up with an old friend the other day, it was great. I spoke to another friend I haven't seen for a while and I was able to genuinely say 'let me know when you're free and we'll catch up' and mean it. Bought a nice new bike on a whim, and actually ride it, whenever I feel like. I chilled out with my housemate and his friend tonight just casually. I enquired about a tattoo booking now the studios are opening back up and I was able to take the appointment offered to me without having to think about it. The next day one of my besties is coming around with her daughter and new bf for lunch at my place and I'm actually excited about it, not trying to tetris in being able to even do it and dreading interactions with some guy I don't know and a teenager. Then I lined up a date with a really cool seeming guy for lunchtime the next day at a café I like in town. 

That's a whole weekend line-up, just like a NORMAL person, just living life. Haven't been able to just do shit like that for so long it's honestly like 'oh that's something other people get to do, not me'. But screw that, I DO get to hang out with with mates and make appointments and go on dates and eat at cafés and buy myself nice things and live my goddamn life. Weed was like a prison. A warm, heavy, comfortable prison. I'm glad to be out of prison finally."

Drove to the nearest high bridge and i stood there on the edge for maybe 30 minutes before someone stopped and pulled me away. I couldnt stop crying for 4 hours and my life is so miserable. Lost both of my parents when i was 5, no brothers or sisters and i got 0 friends. I have/had? a wife and a 2 yo daughter and i cant even look them in the eyes without losing my mind and crying.

I was craving it as well while I was quitting, but comparing that crave to the current one, this one is way harder. I thought the cravings I was having after a 100 days were tough, but in reality they were easy. I definitely do feel better when I lay off the weed, so I am taking this as a lesson learned and whenever I feel the need to smoke again, I will remember that fighting the urge after being off of it for a while is easier than just ""doing it one time"" and then fighting off that crave.

I gave up weed eight years ago and after a fairly traumatic breakup earlier in the year I began smoking again. During that time I met an amazing woman and the first three months of our relationship were carefree and fun but the past little bit I’ve let myself fall down the rabbit hole of smoking almost an ounce a fortnight. It’s made me anxious, jealous and I haven’t performed professionally. I had to recognise the impact and give myself space again. I now realise I sadly can’t have a casual relationship with weed and I need to stop. So instead of spending my money on an ounce I took my GF for dinner at a fancy Italian place and we laughed more than we have for a long time and enjoyed a bottle of red wine. I feel more in control of my emotions and decisions than I have in months and I can’t think of a life in which weed plays a role.

Just smoked after 2 months sober. What I learned,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iakbmu/just_smoked_after_2_months_sober_what_i_learned/,2020-08-16 06:10:04,"Thought about relapsing lately? Your brain convincing you one time won’t hurt/you can moderate/anything of that sort? Lucky for you, I smoked last night after two months and can tell you all about it so you don’t have to. 

Prior to the evening when I smoked, I was browsing this subreddit feverishly looking up “relapse” to see what people’s experiences were (and ultimately trying to convince myself it wouldn’t be so bad, that I could be different, etc). I ended up being so sure that smoking one time wouldn’t completely derail me. I didn’t want to believe people’s accounts of relapsing and having anxiety, binge eating, and feeling shitty the following day. Surprise! It happened to me.

What happened when I smoked: it felt great. At least for the first hour. I got really high and, I won’t lie, I was enjoying myself. But following the first hour was when it went downhill.

I started to feel beyond groggy and slightly anxious. I felt so incapacitated. I noticed some of the old negatives that happened when I used to smoke daily (clenching my jaw, overall bodily discomfort and feeling overwhelmed). I proceeded to eat half a party sized bag of salt and vinegar chips. Yikes. I ended up needing to go to bed because the weed made me so exhausted.

Cue this morning, woke up feeling like a foggy piece of shit. I think I woke up reanimated into an actual zombie. Worst of all, my cravings came back with a vengeance stronger than when I was on my sober streak. Currently I’m feeling some pretty bad cravings that most likely wouldn’t have been as strong if I didn’t smoke last night. My brain is also continuing to convince me I can moderate.

Moral of the story: don’t relapse. I know it sounds simple but I can promise you it isn’t worth it. People’s relapse stories on here are not just them being overly cautious or exaggerating the symptoms. Stay strong and avoid the temptation, it’ll be better in the long run I promise.

Stay strong everyone! You’ve got this! Back to day 1."

Weed makes pleasure too simple.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bk4blh/weed_makes_pleasure_too_simple/,2019-05-03 08:19:48,"Being able to smoke and immediately get pleasure ultimately fucks your brain’s reward system. You need to get pleasure from complex events in your life rather than smoking a plant. I felt disassociated from everything around me when I was smoking every day.
Now I see why. My brain didn’t *need* to be in touch with events around me to have a good time. This is short term happiness that gets old eventually. Sustained happiness can not be that simple.

Appreciate what’s around you. Quitting is going to be fucking rough. This hardship doesn’t mean your mind is ruined by any means. Your mind needs time to adapt without daily weed and to learn how to reward you accordingly. Let your mind get used to getting high on your own life and the events that are happening to you. 

Soon enough, you’ll feel better than you can ever remember feeling."

EDIT: Hello everyone, I’d like to address something for a select few people who have a different opinion than I. This subreddit is about addiction, it’s for people (like myself) who have finally come to terms that they cannot use THC moderately, responsibly, casually, healthily, however you’d like to put it. It affects us negatively, it’s hurt us or held us back in one way or another. I’m not trying to say that the plant itself has no benefits, I actually believe in the benefits of CBD, but that’s a whole different story for a whole different subreddit. (My opinion): THC and I are NOT compatible,  I can’t form a healthy relationship with it and I feel like a better version of myself without it. If you can live a healthy lifestyle and still use THC in moderation, or you feel it helps you become more creative in your own right, then this post/subreddit may not be for you. Thank you for sharing your opinion, and I’m glad THC hasn’t had the effect it’s had on me and many others here."

haven't smoked in a week and the change was immediate (20f),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i69cyd/havent_smoked_in_a_week_and_the_change_was/,2020-08-09 03:42:38,"Let me start by saying that I believe marijuana is a transformative plant- smoking it can bring out the best in a person, or it can bring out the worst- and sometimes, it flips. Sometimes it can bring you a great burst of creativity... other times you're locked in your room, shaking under your sheets. I started smoking socially, and at first, what a world!! Weed made everything... *better*. It was something to do with my friends when we went hiking, or to the beach, or to watch a movie. Weed was a welcome accompaniment to any and all activities, hell, sometimes that *was* the only activity- we would just sit around, smoke, and shoot the shit. It was a great conversation starter, as just about everyone smokes nowadays. Smoking weed was a way to escape from my thoughts and enjoy everything around me.

But at some point over the last 2 years, that changed. My first semester of college is where things took a nose-dive. I was 18, a fresh lil baby who had never been away from home for more than a month, and I fell into the wrong crowd almost immediately. At first, we would take all sorts of precautions, like using a Smoke Buddy, blowing out the window, etc, until we were smoking big ass blunts in the bathroom without covering the vents. All we would do was toke, and I would go to class reeking to high heaven, not retaining a single thing. Eventually it got to the point that we all stopped going to class because it interfered with us getting high. The apartment that we all lived at (some rent-free) became sticky, like the ground was covered in tar. Leaving wasn't exactly terrifying, but it was *really* unpleasant. Anytime I did leave, all I could think about was getting back as soon as possible to smoke with my ""friends"". I didn't want to, no, I couldn't leave, because what if I missed out on something? What if T did something hilarious or a great conversation happened and I wasn't there to add my brainless contribution? Even worse, what if they were talking shit about me? And where was I, at the dining halls or in class? Nothing was more important than being there, every minute, everyday- not personal time to recenter myself, not class, certainly not food. I may be one of the few folks who got the reverse Freshman 15.

After... further *bad* experiences winter break that I won't go into, I finally went home and realized that I was too immature for it all. Being on your own required a level of strength that I didn't yet have, even if the university is holding your hand on the journey to independence.  I pulled out of the main campus, and enrolled in the regional campuses- commuting from home, I was going to classes and doing well for myself, safe back in the nest. But I was still smoking.

I had to smoke to do anything. Cleaning my cat's litter box? Better spark up first. Going to work? Just a little hit. What a day, I just want to smoke and pass out in front of How I Met Your Mother, or Love After Lock-Up, or any other mindless sitcom that would allow me to consume, consume, consume, no thoughts required. I binged so much reality television that my speech patterns would mimic whatever stupid show I was watching at the time. My social skills went down the toilet because I was always high- I started stuttering, my brain would ""hitch"" (my term for not being able to think properly), my anxiety sky-rocketed as my depression spiraled. Instead of getting out of my head, weed forced me in deeper, at gun-point. I would be nearly comatose on my bed with a head that felt like it was full of wasps. I am an incredibly visual person, and weed would bring me 4K HD visions, crystal fucking clear, of past humiliations, of future possibilities that would always veer towards negativity, of my present pimply, yellow-toothed self (because of all of the shit food I would eat and how my skin and teeth reacts to smoke). But despite every negative effect it gave me, despite how it cemented me and made me stagnate, I couldn't stop. Something about the brain buzz that I both loved and feared.

But one day, high as usual, I went into the bathroom to look at myself. The familiar rush of self-loathing filled me but there was something else this time. It was the strongest desire to change everything about me, including the environment surrounding me. More than anything, I wanted to be the best version of myself living far, far away. Away from my childhood room and the rut I stuck myself in: being independent, living my best life, and most importantly, not dependent on a substance to get me through the day, a substance that was inexplicably tied to the trauma I had endured 2 years ago and was reliving every time I picked up the bong. I wish I could say that then was when I stopped smoking (I continued to use for weeks after this epiphany), but I made a goal- I would move out by the beginning of August, and no matter what, I would never smoke weed at my new place. 

It's been a week since I moved in, and I kept my word, and the change was instantaneous. My brain fog cleared up, I no longer stutter, or struggle as hard finding the right words, my anxiety is considerably lower, I'm very social with my roommates- and though I still feel sad, it's not the intense waves of depression that almost drowned me. My teeth have even lightened a few shades and my acne is calming down. With this change of habit, some new habits have formed as well. I'm cooking instead of eating fast food, keeping up with my hygiene, I make it a point to be more neat and organized. The only change that I still need to make is implementing a work-out routine and being less sedentary, but despite it all, I'm working everyday to be the best version of myself. About damn time."

Smoked a joint yesterday after 5 months,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i1ao0s/smoked_a_joint_yesterday_after_5_months/,2020-07-31 20:35:11,"I wanted to share my experience smoking yesterday. Because it was not at all how i expected it to be. First a little back story: 

Been completely clean for 5 months, having amazing days and terrible ones. I guess how the life of a human being should be. Initially it was tough, the first 2 weeks i craved all the fucking time. Read a lot of good tips here, and i think as many of you i now had to meet my problems head on instead of smoking them away. Once that initial period was over, i felt amazing. I did so many good things for myself, like eating healthy, exercising, meditating, got my sleep schedule back on track etc. Applied for a masters program, trying to move my life forward.

As time went by, the effect of these good actions diminished, or atleast it felt like it. Objectively the value they carry did not, ofc. Exercising is just as good (if not better) for you when you feel shit as when you feel great. But over time my habits slipped, and i went back to behaviour i associate with smoking, like binge watching TV, youtube, sleeping for a long time, eating junk. Basically a lot of distractions and short-term gratification. My problems were not gone, and i was tired of fighting. This happened around 3 month mark and just grew in my mind. 

I saw myself diminish, and with these behaviours i once again found myself craving for a smoke. Like a lot. I even bought some other herbs (non-psychoactive) to help, but all that did was reminding myself of earlier times, almost glorifying the days i smoked weed. 

So, yesterday i met up with a friend group i used to smoke a lot with. We started toghetter like 8 years ago and had that habit as an anchor in our friendship. One of them had some weed, and rolled one up and sparked it. Im actually amazed at how easy i accepted, but it didnt seem like the biggest of deals. I think subconsciously i had been waiting for this moment, and had already accepted i was gonna smoke. After all, i had gone 5 months without, and i was craving a lot. Just one as a prize for all the hard work, right? Even though i know that life is better without it, i had proven that to myself. Which of course was the real reward of those 5 months, and the joy that accompanied the fact that i made it through. For a time i forgot that pride i had in that accomplishment. 

To the moral of the story: the experience actually turned out great - not because it was so great smoking, it was not (got anxious, my mind felt blurred, was lethargic etc) - but because that right there showed me what a fucking waste of my life smoking is. It really solidified the fact that i dont want to smoke, there were reasons i quit. It showed me that it was not at all how i fantasized it to be, my glorification of it was so off it was hilarious. 

Im not beating myself up over it, instead choosing to be grateful for my 5 months and with new spirit regarding the future. I will not smoke. Maybe i needed a reminder to continue on my sober journey. Thanks to all of you for printing this idea in my mind, that 1 slip up does not equal full blown relapse. My progress is not gone, all the work i did is still valid. And even though my problems are not gone, at least i can say i tried really hard at resolving them, and that's what I'm gonna continue doing. This perspective was lost on me yesterday, but i found it again. 

Sorry for the long post, I hope someone maybe can relate to some of it and can get something out of my experience. To all the people going strong - keep going. Let my slip up prove to you that it isnt worth it, you dont need to smoke. Your reasons for quitting were real, and still are. It truly is not worth it. Take care of yourself, love yourself - not a fucking plant.

TLDR; Was 5 months sober. Smoked a joint. It sucked. Got a nice realization out of the experience. Motivated to continue on my sober journey. Remember the reasons you quit. Love yourself, never forget that you deserve a happy life without addiction, and that its possible. Work is required, but its really worth it."

I didn’t google it, or Reddit it, but I started talking to my friends about it. They were all trying to convince me not to quit for the rest of the day. Some had pretty good arguments and I was starting to think weed wasn’t the problem. I was about to go smoke with my friends when I got a notification on my phone, “r/leaves is a recommended community”. It truly stopped me in my tracks. I was minutes away from smoking. I didn’t know what to think, was this just a coincidence? Is this my phone listening to my conversations? Or is this really a sign? Being skeptical, I opened up the subreddit and the first post I saw addressed my exact situation with my mental health and was just spot on. I haven’t smoked in a week since then and I think it might be truly over for me. Thank you guys."
Today we celebrated my moms 68th birthday..,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bcqd2p/today_we_celebrated_my_moms_68th_birthday/,2019-04-13 17:15:18,"I didn’t smoke before she opened presents. I didn’t sit there wishing she’d skip the cards so we could be done sooner and I could go smoke, or lay in my bed high. I even bought her a present worth $75 - the most I have ever spent on a gift for one of my parents. I didn’t choose the card that was 2.99 vs 8.99 because I knew I’d need that extra $6 later to pick up or for gas. I didn’t think twice about her hugging me - or having to do my ritual of lotion, perfume and eye drops before coming downstairs..

All this is new for me since quitting 66 days ago. I never had money. I never wanted to be around my family for more than 10 minutes. But today, I was 100% sober, present and truly happy with them as we celebrated my moms 68th year of life... she even cried while reading the card I bought her (worth the 9 bucks, haha)!

I can honestly, full heartedly say that quitting is the best decision I have made in years. 

Leave the weed behind. Take advantage of the time you have with what (and who) is important in your life. 

Have a good day everyone!

"8 years stoned, took six months to quit. But it's day 50! Some of the things that helped:",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gzptc6/8_years_stoned_took_six_months_to_quit_but_its/,2020-06-09 19:54:31,"It's been 50 days since 420.

After six months of actively trying to quit and failing- daily, weekly, continuously...here we are. I had been smoking daily for about 8 years and had previously been an alcoholic.

**Things that helped me:**

* Routine! (Plan your day the night before. Know what you'll do the next day as soon as you wake up.)
* One. Day. At. A . Time.
* Each day begins with meditation and Wim Hof breathing.
* Each day ends with some light yoga/zen time, thank yourself for persevering towards sobriety and making yourself a better human.
* Learn about the dopamine system and how your behavior is wired. Knowing what is going on in your head may provide answers and then you can implement solutions.
* Get the f%$k off social media and the news. That garbage is designed to trigger negative emotions and hook you. Social media lowers your self worth, distracts you from the present, and is designed to give you dopamine releases (the same system you're currently trying to fix by not smoking).

This journey was one I took alone... isolated due to covid. Maybe that helped because I wasn't around any old smoke buddies. If you have a good friend or family group, stay connected. We're deeply wired for human connection.

The first 2-3 weeks may have been the most psychologically challenging minutes and days of my life..I wasn't sure I'd make it through. Hell, I wasn't sure of anything. I was going minute to minute at times.

But here at day 50- it's hard to describe what life can be like until you break through. All I can say is that not smoking changed me in so many ways- ALL for the better.

Whoever you are and whatever your story is, always believe that you can change. All the love, all the power.

**Tldr: Things that helped me quit:** routine, meditation, yoga, quit social media, learn about dopamine system, keep believing in yourself.

**Edit- Thank you for the gold! I'm not sure what to do with it, but it's shiny and it was kind of you.** 

**Edit- It's been really great chatting with everyone today, I was a lurker on here for months and the support we give each other is what will pull us through.**"

"I Thought Smoking Made Me A ‘Chilled Out’ Person. It Actually Made Me Irritable, Anxious and a Bit of a Dick",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gsp3xc/i_thought_smoking_made_me_a_chilled_out_person_it/,2020-05-29 12:38:27," **6 weeks** sober today.

I have a lot more patience for things and people in my life. 

I am now able to open up to them and actually express how I feel about things. This makes me overall happier and a better person to be around.

This has improved my relationships with close friends and my parents in particular.

Smoking clouded my mind and stopped me processing things which would build up inside me until they would blow up one day. 

Clearing that fog has let me identify other problems in my life which I now have the courage to own up to and fix after smoking daily for 15 years.

Best of luck to everyone else going through the same thing at the moment.

The journey so far has been well worth it and I am looking forward to pushing on even further and thanks for all of the support!"
One year free of weed. I am Transformed.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gov9kv/one_year_free_of_weed_i_am_transformed/,2020-05-23 04:28:56,"Today is my one year anniversary clean of weed. I can say the benefits of weed free living are so much better than the temporary joy of getting high. I made space to receive lessons and blessings from the universe, and I am clear enough to be the master of my reality instead of someone who is consistently out of alignment. I no longer need to seek relief from substance. I can create my own relief. I have learned how to harness my own inherent power and I couldn’t describe the impact of that on my life. I faced challenges and traumas and made it my mission to rely on myself for my healing and love. It wasn’t easy but my mental state is so solid right now. I am living in pure contentment. 

Don’t ever give up on yourself or that dream of being clean. anything you believe is already real and all you desire is already yours."
5 years clean today!🎉,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d1rakb/5_years_clean_today/,2019-09-09 18:00:55,"So today marks five years clean from weed!

The best advice I can give is, it DOES get easier! I can't stand being around it now and don't get tempted at all. 

I used to be going through a good 2-3 grams a day, everyday. I struggled pretty bad to not have it. The first year was difficult but after time went on I realised I stopped counting the minutes/hours/days and started forgetting about it.

When I could smell it, I would get a physical yearning for it and now it's a repulsion. 

This is a big deal for me and I'm so proud of myself to be where I am today."
I am one year sober today.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cd9m73/i_am_one_year_sober_today/,2019-07-15 03:04:53,"I’m 34 and this is the longest I’ve been sober since starting smoking at 16. 

It is a constant choice to remain sober. I live in a state where it’s legal and know how easy it would be to stop by a dispensary or call for a delivery. I still crave it and still miss it. But I accept that it’s no longer a part of my life. 

In the last year, I feel like I’ve finally grown up. I’m more comfortable with myself as a person, feel less daily anxiety, less mood swings. I changed my career, got into wicked good shape and donated a kidney to a family member. 

Giving up weed was a sacrifice but the rewards are amazing and worth the daily struggle. I am feeling a lot of quiet pride today. It’s neat.

Edit: whoever gilded this- thanks from the bottom of my soul. Today is meaningful."

I lost something very important to me while stoned... It's time to quit,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i014eo/i_lost_something_very_important_to_me_while/,2020-07-29 17:56:23,"As the title says. 

I am a traveller, I love to go backpacking and camping and do so almost every weekend. This last weekend I went camping in a new area, so I smoked up and explored like I usually do. It started to get a little late and a thunderstorm was coming, so I knew I had to find a place to set up my hammock and tarp, except when I got back in my car, it wouldn't start. 

I started to freak out because I was in the middle of nowhere and I know next to nothing about auto mechanics, so I packed up my backpack with almost an ounce of weed (everything I had in my car), my wallet, and a bunch of other gear. My plan was to walk until I could find somebody to help, but if I got lost along the way, I still had weed, food, and other stuff. And of course the first thing I did before leaving my car was smoke up.

Well, as it turns out, I only had to walk about a quarter mile before I flagged down a mountain biker, who came with me to my car and quickly knew what was up and fixed it. I was so ecstatic; I thanked him, got in my car, and drove off.... Not knowing I left my backpack on the ground next to my car. I don't know if I ran over it but I'm sure it got soaked in the thunderstorm. 

I drove maybe 2 hours out before I realised I left my backpack. I freaked out again and tore down the mountain roads until I got back to my campsite, but my backpack was gone. 

This backpack had been with me to all 7 continents. I've travelled with it for years and years and it became one of my most treasured possessions. So, I figured its time. I lost it because I was stoned. 

It made me realise: I am so dumb when I'm stoned. I'm a physicist, but because of this habit, I have been struggling to complete classes and I've been neglecting a lot of tasks for my research group.

I have so many more reasons I want to quit, but this was the icing on the cake. My resolve feels stronger than any other time I've wanted to quit. I just hope I can stick to it this time."
"I smoked weed for the last time on June 17th, 2018... One year ago, today.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/c1td2e/i_smoked_weed_for_the_last_time_on_june_17th_2018/,2019-06-18 01:26:05,"One year ago today I smoked weed for the last time. I was miserably depressed, hopeless, and I couldn't see a way out. I had tried to stop smoking weed a countless number of times, only to forget completely about my goal and start smoking again.

&#x200B;

For the last month that I was on a bender, I smoked weed primarily with guys I met online, who I was either using for weed or to feel less lonely. I put myself in countless dangerous and silly situations just to get high. One time I drove two hours to smoke a blunt with some guy who kept trying to pressure me into hooking up with him. I had also broken my ankle two months before that, and was still hobbling around, very slowly. One time I had to hobble out of a guy's house who had made me extremely uncomfortable, and I ended up hurting myself even more because I couldn't get away fast enough. Those drives home were filled with desperation, shame, fear, and self loathing. I almost crashed my car multiple times.

&#x200B;

I had to leave school for a second semester in a row, and due to my addiction, I felt hopeless that I would ever graduate.  

&#x200B;

The only two people I could find to actually sell me weed were always ripping me off, but I needed weed to function, so it was either be ripped off and/or receive a stemmy bag, or hang out with these guys I mentioned prior. I had ruined everything positive in my life: my schooling, friendships, relationships. I lied to and hurt the people who cared about me most, and eventually I was all alone. If someone had a problem with my weed smoking, I cut them off, because they were buzz kills and trying to control me. I spent all my money on weed and all of my time was dedicated to it. Everything else was a chore, but weed was a given. 

&#x200B;

I kept buying weed and smoking it when I didn't want to. I couldn't even stand to look at myself in the mirror. I looked dead and I hated myself so much.

&#x200B;

I finally decided to try one more time. I finished my weed on June 17th and I was determined that would be the last time I quit. I had said I would quit so many times, so I don't think I really believed that I would stay away from weed. However, after midnight, I wrote a note to myself in my phone ""June 18th. Just for today."" (https://imgur.com/a/310LvQn the note on my phone). Just for that day, I would not smoke. So I did that. Again and again and again.

&#x200B;

I do recovery to keep myself away from weed. I couldn't quit on my own. I needed help. I have not had to smoke weed since that day, and I am so incredibly grateful. I'm also grateful to r/leaves. You guys have saved my butt more times than I can count.

&#x200B;

I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree a month ago, which was only possible because I got sober. I have true friends now who I show up for emotionally as they do for me. The life is back in my eyes. I look at myself in the mirror and I see a wide eyed, fierce woman looking back at me. I no longer hang out with people I do not want to. I have stayed single since September because I truly needed to work on myself. I do believe that I will eventually show up for someone and be able to have a meaningful relationship when the time is right. I am finally able to be honest, loving, and emotionally present.

&#x200B;

Quitting weed did not make everything better, but it made me ABLE to make my life better. I no longer set fire to my life while trying to put it out with gasoline. I live a non-chaotic life today. Today I am at peace, and today I will NOT smoke weed with you all. Thank you for being a part of my recovery. One day at a time.

Advice?,https://v.redd.it/qhoad36320c41,2020-01-21 00:15:06,
Earned vs unearned dopamine,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hjtino/earned_vs_unearned_dopamine/,2020-07-02 12:52:40,"This is what it seems to boil down to. When I smoke, play videogames, watch porn etc, I did not earn that dopamine. These things ruin me because I get rewarded for doing nothing. Eventually my dopamine receptors get numb, nothing feels good anymore but I can't stop doing it. I become weak, pathetic, nervous, unnaturally introverted and reclusive. I enter into a nasty negative feedback loop and it becomes that much harder to do something productive. When I'm stoned, I almost never clean, and when I do, it's the bare minimum to avoid disgust. I never invited anyone over because I was too ashamed and too lazy to clean. When I'm sober, I take pride in cleaning. I listen to music and clean my apartment like I'm creating art. I want it to look beautiful, I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish, I get that dopamine and I feel good about it. My environment is clean because my mind is clean and vice versa. I feel healthy, because rather than giving in to the munchies and buying fast food, I cook healthy, tasty and delicious food which nourishes me.

When I discipline myself to earn my pleasure, it becomes productive rather than destructive.

These are the things that helped me get to where I am now:

1. Meditation.
This helps me with withdrawals and mood swings. It gives me the peace and calm that I used to try to get from weed. It also unlocked some of my dormant power and I felt my consciousness expand.

2. Exercise.
I needed to burn the excess energy and release endorphins, this is especially vital for me early on when I'm having withdrawals and raging. I choose exercise which I enjoy - MMA and rock climbing. I don't need discipline to do these things because I enjoy them. I want to take advantage of my youth because one day I'll be old. So I want to use my body the way it was designed, heal my lungs and feel strong. Yoga is also great for me because it checks both exercise and meditation.

3. Clean eating.
All the sugar and bad fats are a drug in and of themselves. I didn't earn that fast food or that sugar hit that just has me feeling awful and anxious afterwards. Learning to cook some basic, healthy, tasty meals was a great investment for me. It helped me with emotional stability and feeling good all the time.

4. Clean room.
A clean room, for me, means a clean mind. I've noticed that broke, addicted, wretched people live in filth. But when I'm proud of my apartment, I feel proud, like a King. I want to be clean so that I resonate with my environment. I've learned why they say that ""cleanliness is next to godliness.""

5. Social distancing.
From the people who encouraged me to remain a loser. I spend more time around people who want the best for me. Those who don't like me smoking. I used to have no one, but being sober allowed me to get out there and meet people through engaging in some hobbies. Being sober also allowed me to find hobbies outside of staying home and gaming.

6. Video games.
I used to zone out for hours at a time every day, losing my self in the digital world. In terms of its effects on the brain, video game addiction is not that different to weed addiction IMO. There are better things to do with my valuable free time that don't encourage my need for escapism. Time lost on games gives me very little if any return on investment. I'm happier in the long run when I'm doing more productive things.

7. I read 'Quitting weed: The complete guide' by Matthew Clarke.
I read a few books like this, but they were so cringe I continued to smoke. This one really is the complete guide and it helped program my brain to see my predicament for what it is.
 
8. Sexual discipline.
Porn? I didn't earn that woman. Masturbation? I didn't earn that orgasm. Undressing a woman with my eyes? I didn't earn the right to see her naked. Lost in a sexual fantasy? I never earned the right to have sex with her. If I can keep my mind clean, it's a lot easier to retain my seed. There's a reason why almost all cultures (until recently) and religions stress sexual discipline. I believe we've lost sight of that. Now I don't know about women, but IMO, for men, this might be the single greatest life hack. It has been for me at least. All good habits can follow on from this one. The power and gravitas I develop has me feeling like a super hero, and women become very drawn to me. People respect and admire me a lot more when I've been retaining, and everything seems to get better. It's strange how powerful this practice can be for a lot of the men who try it.

Tutorial: How to quit weed and be happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5yzwyr/tutorial_how_to_quit_weed_and_be_happy/,2017-03-12 21:55:47,"                                         The Introduction
Hello, my name is Dylan. I have been pouring my heart and soul into this post for the 17 days I have been free of weed. I was able to quit with ease, opposed to the many times where I struggled for months only to relapse. I experienced no cravings whatsoever after quitting, and hardly noticed the withdrawals. Happiness was an inevitable byproduct of this process, this fundamental change in attitude. What changed? I will get to that later on, but I would like to start by giving you some context of where I am coming from. 

I’d like to start by saying that weed in and of itself is fine. I still support legalization and recognize that it can be very useful, has many medicinal uses, and is ultimately fine in moderation, like alcohol. The problem is we cannot moderate here - we only abuse. I hope to expose the reality of our situation to you ladies and gents – warning, it may not be the reality you are expecting. The good news is you are not addicted to weed in the slightest. Nope, you read that right. You are not addicted to weed. The bad news is that it is a sign of underlying issues in your life. But don’t worry, I have attempted and hopefully succeeded in creating an actionable plan that can be used to quit weed, make it through the withdrawals, and live happily ever after! If this sounds interesting, please read on!
 
I know it is long, but I have chosen each and every word carefully to convey my message in detail. I wrote this mainly to think through my own struggles with addiction, but edited it to share with everyone here. This isn’t my real account and couldn’t care less about karma so please upvote if this was helpful to you. This community has given me so much support this is the least I could do to repay you guys. Enjoy!  

                                            The Context
I know what you are thinking after reading the title. “Phh, theres no way. I have tried many times and it is never that straightforward. Who does this guy think he is?!"". I am one of you. I am a 21-year-old college student, double-majoring in Accounting and Finance. I am from Denver, Colorado, and therefore have access to weed 24/7. I used to smoke 2-3 grams of weed a day; 3-4 spliffs a day, 3-4 big dabs minimum, and often 10+ “mokes”, AKA weed and tobacco bong rips. I was a fucking mess. And I knew it, but was never able to change. Reading the posts on here for a while, I know I smoke much more than most of you. Not bragging, quite the opposite actually. 

Isn’t that the worst? The guilt of knowing you are sabotaging yourself, but not being able to stop? I was there for 3 years. I know you may be inclined to dismiss my opinion based on being young, not smoking for as long, etc. But please read on; make that decision at the end of my post. If you still think that, call me out in the comments. I don’t mind, I can take it and potentially clear up some misconceptions. I know my message is valuable, hence why I put 25+ hours into this post. 

                                           The Addiction

So you think you want to quit weed, huh? I say “think” because often there is a lot of mixed emotions with this process. Sure, you know it is fucking with your life. That’s why you’re here on /r/leaves. But you also still think you love this plant. You remember the good ol’ days: the joy, laughter, the connections with like-minded individuals, revelations and euphoric moments that seemingly could only stem from marijuana. Even during the bad times, at least Mary Jane was always there to sooth your emotions and make you feel better right? It has always been there for you, to the point where it became a big part of your life. 

We all know that there are alternative ways to get the same high, the same rush of dopamine - we see examples of these everyday on this sub. Hobbies and pastimes that are less expensive, more fun, healthier, etc. We all have surely compiled a list of reasons to quit too. “Its messing with my sleep”, or “Think of the money I could save”. But it never seems to work, right? You have always known you need to quit, and articulating it can reinforce these reasons, but it often doesn’t seem to stick does it?

 You find that after a few days, your weed-addicted brain tears those reasons to shreds. “It won’t be that expensive if I smoke ___ times a month!” or the biggest lie, “I finally have control and can now smoke again”. If you could control your weed usage, you wouldn’t be here. Sometimes, you relapse because you truly have convinced yourself that you cannot function or be happy sober, so you reluctantly return back to the marijuana. 

Want to know why? It will sound like an accusation, but it is the underlying truth of the situation. You never made a serious attempt to change the mindset that drives these compulsions. You have been trying control your actions by quitting WEED, not the mindset that dictates our actions. Therefore it is no surprise that many simply trade on addition for another. Still the same underlying thought process, just a different addiction. You are still desperately seeking for external sources to derive meaning and happiness from. When in reality, happiness blooms from within. 

Deep down, or maybe not even that deep down, you still wish you could smoke if it just didn’t do ______ to you. You still think weed could play a role in your life. You still want to smoke every day if things were different, some alternate reality in which it was actually harmless. Unfortunately you live in this universe where it is holding you back, to a degree that you may not even realize. I certainly didn’t for a long time. It made me complacent; I was happy being a stoner and therefore stopped attempting to reach my admittedly ambitious goals. I hope to elaborate on this fundamental concept further in the following parable I wrote, appropriately titled: The Mirage.  
 
                                            The Mirage 

Imagine yourself in the third person. You are walking in a forest, probably smoking a nicely rolled joint or hitting your favorite pipe. It is a beautiful forest, no matter if you are sober or high. Green foliage as far as the eye can see, dense trees and wildlife abound. You can go any direction you’d like, but you chose stick to the path. Everyone else always seems to, and you’re pretty sure you don’t have a choice to stray if you tried. Though the areas beyond the path are breathtaking, they are also a bit intimidating; you almost never see footprints outside of the path. 

After walking for what seems like an eternity, you come across a fork in the path. Down one path is a Hedonist’s dream. It is your favorite hiking spot, the base of a large ravine with a huge river pouring down the middle. It has all your favorite activities; limitless high quality bud, wax, maybe even tobacco if you’re like me. It has a big television to re-watch sitcoms, and an xbox with a VR headset to play the latest games. It has a nice record player for your favorite albums. Everything is covered in silky velvet and extremely comfortable. It is full of delicious food and drink, and you wonder if you just found heaven on earth. 

There is no responsibility down this path; you are free to spend your time doing whatever you’d like. It has all your stoner buds too, all passing the bong and laughing about everything and anything. Of course you see yourself running down that path. You’ve always been a little unsatisfied with life, and this seems like the ultimate escape from what seems like an otherwise mundane and stressful life. You see yourself sit down and rip that first bowl with your buds, thinking you could live here for the rest of your life. And so you do. You smoke so much weed that you are permanently couch-locked. You enjoy any and all food you can get your hands on. Your buddies tell stories from your youth, sometimes repeating themselves. You don’t mind though, you’re ripped after all, barely listening.  Days, months, and finally years go by. You believe yourself to have everything one needs to be happy. Therefore, you truly believe you are happy. Sure, you are occasionally curious what that other path was, and why it even exists. Surely everyone would make the same decision given the same circumstances, right? 

The other path is covered in rocks and foliage. It seems like a continuous, un-ending incline. The trees are denser initially, resulting in a dark hue across the forest. It seems to be less traveled, but you still notice the occasional fresh footprint. Many seem to have gone down this path in the past. Parts of the path have eroded completely, while others lead back to the weed-filled life. You notice further down that this path also continues to branch off. The trees clear to reveal meadows lush with flowers on some paths, while others are encased in darkness with the stench of death in the air. In fact, it seems this forest has endless different paths one could take depending on their inclination.  Each path seems to offer its own unique beauty and charm on the surface. You still are left wondering why anyone would chose any of these paths, as their seems to be no comfort, no safety. The trails end often, with individuals gathering and forming small communities. Some of them seem happy, but you are not convinced. 

You see evidence that others have arrived at these dead ends, but chosen to continue onwards instead of settling or turning back. Do they know something that these others do not, or are they simply mad? You notice a man breaking off from one of these dead-ends, forming his own path into the forest. He is wearing tattered clothing, only carrying what he deems essential for life. He seems miserable at first glance, often falling over and covered in bruises. He looks very old, but under closer inspection is only a few years older than yourself. You then notice that beneath the dirt smeared across his face, he is smiling. You are shocked; you ask yourself how could a man with nothing, no comfort or safety, seem happier than your friends and yourself even. You start to resent him; he obviously is crazy or delusional for seeking out this dangerous path riddled with warning signs of failure and misery. 

It is obvious that many have chosen to turn back at this point in the forest, or chosen to settle for a dead-end that brings them comfort and security. This man, on the other hand, speeds up as he passes a dead-end. Doesn’t he know the trail ends here, you ask yourself? His smile broadens, and he begins running as fast as he can up into a seemingly hazardous area. You yell out to him, asking, “Are you lost? Why are you out here all alone?”

He stops running, and invites you to walk with him for a bit. He explains that he initially came out here with all his friends years ago after graduating high school. He says that soon after they began this exciting journey, one of his friends found another path in the forest that leads to a place full of happiness, sheltered from the hardships they were encountering. He found a mirage, the man explains - a prison that presents itself as a paradise free from pain. They would would stay in contact, slowly convincing his other friends to join him after the trials of this path became too much to handle. Initially, they would try and continue to talk to the man, asking when he was going to return to them. The friends would tell him about how much he was missing, and how everything was so much better with them. But he didn’t see it that way. 

The man loved the challenges he faced on a daily basis. He admitted that it wasn’t always easy; in fact, he had even gone back to the start at times to join his friends. But it never did anything for him. Sure, he found it comforting. He found it enjoyable at first. But deep down he always knew it was a prison. He knew deep down that this path, this mirage, was a dead end; it was a purgatory for those too afraid to see what the other paths had to offer. Driven mad by the monotony and numbness of the so-called “paradise”, he continued down other paths, sometimes turning back, sometimes struggling for months before reaching an end. 

He had accomplished many things in that time away from his comforts. He had found great joy down other paths, things that brought him the same level of joy his friends had found. And yet, it was different; he felt a sense of accomplishment, a sense of satisfaction that his efforts were not in vein. That being said, he was never satisfied with these either. The main explained that he discovered the further he pushed himself, the greater the end result always was. He quickly started choosing to often break-off from the path entirely, discovering new ways of reaching these end-results, these dead-ends that had stopped many before him in their tracks. Quicker ways, more efficient ways. He learned to identify which paths were worth avoiding, and which were worth his time and energy. Though the challenges never ceased, they became easier to tackle.

 The man found that each dead-end had many potential paths that were simply unmarked; reserved for those brave enough to tackle them. After some research, he found that many of the world’s most successful people had gone down unmarked paths similar to those he was chasing. He became more adept at finding these hidden paths, while becoming more capable at dealing with the hardships thrown at him in the process. His body and mind had grown stronger, while his friend’s bodies withered away in front of the TV. While they were busy playing video games, he had slowly discovered an inner peace, a satisfaction with never being satisfied. He had come to accept these daily challenges as part of this path he chose. He had made peace with it, as he knew deep down it was necessary if he wanted to become the best version of himself. He went from being afraid of the challenges initially, to running at them full speed. He no longer feared the pain, but accepted it as part of the process. He even began to enjoy the pain, as it meant he was doing something worth his time and energy.

After this many years, his worst fear had become his best friends aspirations.  Complacency.  Being satisfied doing nothing, being satisfied with reaching a decent end result. Decent was no longer good enough for the man, he claimed. Sure, a moment of stillness was welcomed, and necessary, to rest his aging bones and occasionally soak in the beauty around him. Too long, however, and anxiety filled his thoughts. Fear of missing opportunities, fear of a mundane life. After his experiences in that mirage, and seeing what it did to his friends, he knew that it he could never settle anymore. He had experienced too much, achieved too much, risen too much to slide all the way back to the start. He knew that these trials he faced are a natural part of choosing this life, the path that many of humanities greatest individuals had been down before.  He knew that pain and struggle were natural phenomenon, and therefore should not be avoided. 

The man had realized realized that the “paradise” was the only thing unnatural in this forest. People escaping reality by hiding from it right at the start of their journey, never experiencing the joys and successes that the other countless paths had to offer. Sure, they know they exist, but they cling to the belief that the challenges couldn’t possibly be worth the payoff. And in a sense, the man said, they were right. The payoff isn’t worth it. But the man understood something that his friends could never hope to; life isn’t about the end result at all, but about the journey one take to strive towards it. Many times the man had achieved his goal, only to find the goal wasn’t what he expected. Many times the man had spent months working for something, only to have the path blocked by something unforeseeable and out of his control. But the man didn’t fret, as in the process of chasing these goals, he had learned more about himself than his friends ever would - what he was capable of, what his real goals and aspirations are, and how to better implement a plan to achieve them. Over the years apart, the man had developed a broad range of skills to face even the most difficult times with ease, while his friends never developed these skills at all. He knew could weather the most brutal trials and tribulations, while his friends lived and died without ever exploring their true capabilities and potential. While his friends had only been focused on what the forest could give to them, the man realized early on that it isn’t what we get from achieving our goals that is important, but what you become from striving to achieve them. 

                                           The struggle

 

“People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals - that is, goals that do not inspire them.” 

So the first part of changing your mindset is understanding what you want and expect from life. So my question to you is: where do you see yourself in 5 years? No, you didn’t accidently stumble into an interview. That being said, there is a very specific reason they ask you this question. It is asked to see if your goals line up with the companies core values. So, answer that question honestly. Then, ask yourself if it is inline with your core values. When I was smoking heavy, I saw myself smoking heavily for far longer than 5 years into the future. I also saw myself continuing to hiding it from my family, I saw the thousands of dollars I would spend on it, and I saw myself continuing to do whatever it takes to keep smoking this plant. I wouldn’t have hesitated cheating on a drug test, or lie to anyone who I didn’t want to know about it. I wouldn’t hesitate to put my health and safety into question to continue chasing this high. I would have kept smoking no matter what it cost me. 

Core values are a critical element of any individual, and it is often what seperates different cultures and groups of people from one another. Hopefully you have a good idea of what yours are, but if not this is a great time to reflect. A good way to identify them is think of the most ideal person in the world in your eyes, or someone you look up to. What would their opinions be on everyday interactions, hobbies, pastimes, politics, or current events? Would they value integrity? Would they give back to their community? Also, what would they be against? Would they support cheaters, would they accept of my tendency to lie about my habits? There are plenty of resources online for this part too. My 3 most important core values are determination, integrity, and generosity. I see my ideal self striving to achieve any goal I put my mind too, no matter how painful or inconvenient. I see myself not lying to family, friends and others who deserve the truth. I also don’t see myself intentionally misleading people, which is a constant reality for a young stoner like myself. I see myself ideally giving back to my communities I consider myself apart of, whether with my time and energy, or a monetary donation. 

So, how well did I stack up? Extremely poorly is my honest answer. I constantly lie to many people in my life - no one is off limits. I have lied to teachers, I lie to employers, I lie to my parents about weed, money, and even the most mundane things for fun. I have never been generous since I started smoking weed. I have denied homeless people food when I have plenty, and have stolen so much weed in my life I lost count. I have showed little empathy to friends and family. I have so much love to give to the world, but instead I just focused on myself and nothing else. I always put myself first and look where it got me. Nowhere. I am more miserable than ever, so don’t worry; I didn’t get away with any of it in the end. 

After an analysis of how my thought process differed from my actions, I realized that something had to give. What I thought I valued was **meaningless** if I could not act on any of it. I was that friend that would say I wanted to do xyz, and then never follow through. I became known for it. I was also that friend that would be cool to your face, only to talk about your flaws behind your back. I talked about close friends in hurtful ways and even bullied some of my less-close friends. I didn’t care, as long as it helped me. It was all about ME. I couldn’t care less when I heard 40+ US citizens were mowed down in a bar in Florida a few months ago, as long as it wasn’t **ME**. Sure, I put on a mask and pretended to care, but I didn’t. It had no impact on me. Getting high was the same - all about me and how I felt, not about how it affected others. 

                                            The Shift 

I am not oblivious; I knew how weed was effecting my actions and causing me to change as an individual. I saw the signs early and often. But you know the great thing about weed is that it can suppress these thoughts. Those nagging pings from my sober self, yelling at me to stop being such a self-centered prick, were silenced completely until I honestly 100% thought my actions were OK and justified. So what was I escaping from, why was I starting to act in such a harmful way towards myself and those around me? It was because I hated myself and weed was slowly stopping to suppress this reality. Why did I hate myself? Because I have an acute anxiety about failure, creating a viscous cycle. I would start to slip in school, have strong pings of anxiety, and use weed to comfort me. The weed would cause me to slip more in school, and therefore more anxiety, followed by, you guessed it – more pot. I have always put extreme pressure on myself, its just how I was raised. I wanted to be the best, but for the first time in my life, it was becoming more and more clear that I wasn’t. So I lashed out. I was angry at the world, and was so fed up with it that I retreated entirely. I quit. Sure, I kept trying to study and do my best, but emotionally I was dead. My moral compass had disappeared in a cloud of smoke; I felt I was wronged, so I did wrong. This is why I was accepting of all the ignorant shit I was doing. This is how I justified my actions. Things weren’t going how I wanted, so like a spoiled brat I spent all my time in my room focusing on my own feelings. Over and over, I would play the same situations in my head. I was the ultimate white knight, only I was protecting myself from the seemingly harsh realities of life. When in reality, I am extremely fortunate and blessed, but was too distracted to see it. 


So what changed? What triggered the change in mindset? Honestly, it was a single quote. 

“Be the best version of yourself”

I wasn’t. Not only was I engaging in the egotistical, disgusting activities listed above, but weed had also started to cause me to fail my classes. “How do I know it was weed, could be anything!” you may be thinking. Well, I have always been quite studious. As a double-major, I spend the majority of my free time studying. We are talking 5 hours of classes a day and 5 hours of studying too. On the weekends I would take Adderall and study for 8+ hours. But even with all this effort, I was failing. Now more than ever, literally failing. And it was because I was smoking before, during and after studying. I don’t know what I was thinking, but once I received those grades it was obvious that if I didn’t make a drastic change then I would fail this semester, therefore graduating late and having my job offer revoked. 

I saw myself as having two distinct choices; two different paths in my journey through the forest. I could continue smoking and potentially ruin my future, or I could quit right there. The choice was finally clear. It was obvious that weed had no place in my life anymore. It had always been obvious to everyone but myself. Once I had this epiphany, quitting weed became as easy as quitting coffee. Sure, I suffered through minor withdrawals. I failed to sleep more than a few hours every night the first week. I had trouble eating and was often waking up dry heaving from the nausea. But I have a few tips that I can share later on that really helped me overcome these symptoms and others with relative ease. 

So why do we seem to struggle with addiction when so many others can use weed and other substances as intended? The key difference is mindset. They are using it to enhance life, while you are using it as a crutch to get through life. “But Dylan, I use marijuana when I go hiking! It makes it so much better!” Im sure you do, that was my favorite time too. But I bet you are just as likely to use it when you are feeling down too. I bet that when you get home after a rough day, tired and beaten down by lifes daily trials, your first thought is to light up. Im willing to bet that you use it for almost every emotion imaginable. Happy, sad, lonely, depressed, overjoyed, angry, confused, bored. At that point, it is no longer enhancing life. It is life. It is where you derive stability, to level out the highs and lows. Eventually, if you smoke enough for long enough, you end up flat-lining completely.  Imagine a life support machine, slowly transitioning from steady peaks and valleys to the dreaded flat-line. We all know what that means, the end of the individuals body and soul. Only, weed is much slower then that. It is obvious to friends and family that you are changing, but you hardly notice. It is only when you are dead inside that you look up and see that everyone has written you off as dead for years, not without lack of trying on their part, but lack of reciprocation on yours. 


No matter your current circumstances, you too are facing a crossroad in your life. Maybe you haven’t been pushed to the wall yet. Maybe it truly hasn’t effected you that much. My response to these claims and those of a similar nature is simple. Why wait? Why wait until your habit hurts a loved one. Why wait till it puts you in financial jeopardy. Why wait till it has caused you so much pain that you are driven into a depressive state. Why are you so afraid of living a sober life, a life where you are free to chase your goals and aspirations at any time of the day. Are you really that satisfied with your current status that you think giving up weed will only detract from your happiness? Imagine meeting an alternate version of yourself, a version that hadn’t welcomed weed into your life. How would you picture him or her? Surely they would be more successful and happy, spending their free time enriching their in mind, body and soul opposed to burning a dried out plant. Our brain can trick us into believing almost anything, but it cannot distort reality enough to suggest that we are happier wasting a significant portion of our lives smoking weed. 

Whether you like it or not, the only time you can make this change and get back on the right path is now. The only thing that truly exists in the world is this current moment. You cannot change how you spent all those years; you cannot get back the money you’ve figuratively burned to chase a high that is no longer obtainable. But you can still change. You can stop smoking right now. No, you don’t have to finish your stash first. You don’t have to wait till Tuesday, or some other arbitrary point in the future to quit. The future doesn’t exist and will never exist in a sense; it will always be the future. If you truly want to be the best version of yourself and taste the sweet fruit that life offers to those brave enough to face it head on, you need to make your last smoke just that – your last smoke. 

                                         The Withdrawls 
Once you make the decision, I promise you it will not be has hard as it seems. You will suffer initially, but what are a few days of suffering compared to a lifetime of greatness and achievement. You can expect, at worst, one to two weeks of moderate symptoms. Difficulty sleeping, nausea, loss of appetite, and irritability are all semi-common. Gosh, don’t those sound lame when put into perspective? It’s the mental aspect that was always the hard part. Without the addicts brain consistently doubting your decision, weed withdrawals are about as extreme as a hangover, and typically last a similar amount of time. They are nothing to fear; in fact, they should be embraced. It’s the first signs of the end of your addiction. These are not permanent in the slightest and will pass as quickly as they appeared. 

Now, the part of withdrawals that were most noticeable to me was fogginess in the head, lightheadedness, anxiety and fatigue. For myself, I found that taking a multi-vitamin, fish oil, magnesium, and iron supplements were critical to rebounding quickly. I will start by discussing the last two, magnesium and iron. Anemia occurs when you have a level of red blood cells (RBCs) in your blood that is lower than normal. This occurs when you are not getting enough Iron in your diet. The symptoms of low Iron are fatigue, lightheadedness, and fogginess. Sound familiar? I have a theory that since most stoners (not all of course) seem to have a poor diet, lacking in red meats, eggs, and leafy greens, that they are often low on Iron. A simple supplement once a day, preferably with vitamin C for absorption, should get you on the right track. Magnesium is a bit trickier. Many of the symptoms of low magnesium are not unique to magnesium deficiency, making it difficult to diagnose with 100% accuracy. That being said, suffers are often filled with anxiety, depression, fatigue, lightheadedness, etc. Vague symptoms, but it is present in most multivitamins so it is worth experimenting with. I found that it helped my anxiety, but it can be hard to determine if it’s a placebo or the magnesium itself. On top of all of this, focus on drinking as much water as possible. This will help you feel refreshed for starters, but also should help with fatigue and fogginess as well. Plus, the whole vital for life thing too ☺ 



                                         The Replacement
Most people on this earth have some sort of coping mechanism to deal with the trials faced in everyday life. Some play video games or binge watch TV, others find themselves getting lost in an art project or other creative outlet. I believe that implementing healthier activities into your life is critical for filling the void in your life left after quitting weed. This time, however, it is important that your coping mechanism is building up your core values, not acting as a detriment to yourself and your character. Sure, in an ideal world you would only derive your happiness from within, and that is still the end goal. For now, I needed some way of focusing all my free time into something productive. I have been practicing meditation to stabilize my emotions, rid myself of anxiety, and rid myself of all thoughts entirely for a short time. This has helped me tremendously in getting the same calmness, the same stillness that I only occasionally got from weed in the first place. For me, I also replaced marijuana with skateboarding and learning how to draw with charcoal. These work for me because I love being creative and staying physically fit. They are in line with my core values as I have poured my heart and soul into them, and have even started giving skateboard lessons to a friend’s brother to help pass on my skills. 

This subreddit has many examples of great, healthier coping mechanisms that you can incorporate. But honestly, you know what works for you best. What are your passions? If you can’t think of something specific, or don’t have the same passions anymore and don’t know where to start, I may be able to help. Exercise is a big one, as it releases plenty of dopamine and can help accelerate THC leaving your body.  Creativity is another critical aspect of our lives that is often overlooked. I think creative pastimes are so, so important as they allow us to truly be engrossed in the process. They stimulate both sides of our brain like nothing else, and can be very helpful for thinking of unique solutions to the daily struggles in your life. I am very career focused, so I would also try and find a program/skill/hobby that can be used to leverage your knowledge and experience in your field. For example, I recently started teaching my self a data-analytics software called Essbase. Sound boring? Its not. Boring activities are not actually boring; it’s a sign that you have a boring mind. Life is all about perspective. Sure, you can cast off everything that sounds confusing and difficult as too boring to be worth it. But, what if you accepted the mundaneness and eventually learned to love it? Data-analytics, for those unaware, is using a large volume of data from multiple sources to derive patterns and therefore conclusions. These conclusions can be used to market a firms product or service more effectively, and with less resources. This increases the enterprise value of the firm and overall leads to more profit. While you may look at the data and be put off right away, if you can just spend enough time to learn how to interpret it, it becomes extremely fun. Its fun like solving a puzzle is fun. It stimulates your brain, forces you to think critically and and use the analytical part of your brain, while also leveraging the creative side. If you do it right, you and everyone else at the company is going to make more money and have more job security. 

Im not saying you have to love data-analytics. Of course not! It was just an example of how casting aside potential career building activities because they’re not fun is silly. I think that if you find your ideal industry and put effort into specializing in some aspect of it that calls to you, you will be much better off. You won’t be passionate about them all, but don’t disregard them without giving them a fair shot. 
Are you in IT and don’t know how to code or want to learn a new language? Good time to start! Do you love music but want to branch out your career? Take an online music management course. Learn a new instrument. Are you working a dead-end job and don’t know where to begin? Maybe start looking for unions in your area and see if there are online resources to build a knowledge base on and maybe get an online certificate.  These are just my ideas. I know nothing about what you will find interesting or what your goals are. This is the hard part. 

                                      The Summary & Conclusion
In conclusion, quitting weed is entirely doable once you accept that there is an underlying cause for the addiction. Weed is not and never was the problem; the problem is internal, not external. The problem is your outlook in life and weed is just playing a role in this.  I was a whiny teenager who only cared about the worlds impact on myself, not my impact on the world. I eventually had my back thrown against the wall, finally revealing how silly the whole thing was. But it doesn't have to go that far. You don't have to be pinned against the wall, faced with an ultimatum. Comfort is overrated anyways; I doubt you would like to sit in a beanbag chair watching TV for the rest of your life. Comfort is the enemy of achievement. If you want to succeed more then you want to be comfortable, more then you want to smoke pot, then and only then will you be successful. 

“I was drawn to all the wrong things: I liked to drink, I was lazy, I didn't have a god, politics, ideas, ideals. I was settled into nothingness; a kind of non-being, and I accepted it. I didn't make for an interesting person. I didn't want to be interesting, it was too hard. What I really wanted was only a soft, hazy space to live in, and to be left alone. On the other hand, when I got drunk I screamed, went crazy, got all out of hand. One kind of behavior didn't fit the other. I didn't care.” 

I find a lot of similarities between weed abuse and alcohol abuse. Same underlying emotions, same actions as a result - just a different substance driving it. Just because weed doesn't damage your liver doesn't make it better. Do your core values line up with your actions? If not, it’s time to re-evaluate. 

I hope you enjoyed this write-up, let me know if any parts were confusing and I can elaborate further. I can only express my own opinions, that being said I have read 100's of posts here over the years and believe my message is inline with the overarching opinions of this sub.

Just a suggestion :),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g019x8/just_a_suggestion/,2020-04-12 21:50:22,"You know how when you first started smoking, you thought:

“I wonder what it will be like to try (x activity) while high?”

Well, now you’re likely in a place where you’re high most of the time. You want to be sober. So why not think:

“I wonder what it will be like to go back to doing (x activity) while sober?” 

This method has really helped me develop a newfound appreciation for the finer details I always missed when I was lit :) 

In a way, it’s almost like doing those things again for the first time, because the weed had me so out of touch with reality. 

 hope this helps!"

6. It makes me stumble over my words and sound generally less intelligent.
7. It puts me in a bad mood when I'm coming down.
8. It makes me selfish. This isn't the drug's fault, but I am an addict and therefore I prioritize getting high over all else. 
9. It increases my anxiety and gives me uncomfortable body sensations.
10. It makes me feel foggy and slow.

How addiction works in the brain...,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ddq5ex/how_addiction_works_in_the_brain/,2019-10-05 21:19:10,"I posted this as a comment and I got a few private messages saying I should post it to the whole group. Some of us are truly world champions at being so incredibly hard on ourselves, and that can make staying sober even harder. So, maybe this can help a few people realize, your brain is working just fine. It's doing what it was meant to do, and you just need some 'updating' of your knowledge.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The way addiction works in the brain is like this; You know how you drive to the grocery store from your house? You probably don't even need to think about it. It's ingrained there in a neural pathway cause you've just done it so many times and your brain doesn't have to use much energy to do something its done repeatedly.

Now, when you're doing something new that you've never done before.. its like driving to the grocery store from your house .. but across everyone's yards and driveways, knocking down their bushes and trash cans. But after a while, if you kept driving thru everyone's yards it would knock down the bushes, tamp down the grass and pretty soon you'd have a smooth path that you could drive on.

This is how the brain works - we use the well worn neural pathways the most. We are always making new pathways (unless we're down regulating our brains thru drugs, alcohol, stimulants, etc) and paving over old habits that we aren't doing anymore or lost interest in. You can actually see this in MRIs., fascinating stuff.

Now the brain is designed to **seek pleasure, avoid pain and conserve energy (the motivational triad)** . So whatever we seek pleasure in (or any other repetitive behaviors) becomes one of those very well worn pathways and our brains don't have to use much energy for repetitive habits. It's easy to keep going back to the habit your brain knows because it is seeking pleasure and conserving energy to stay alive. A lot of us will say, ""I don't want to keep smoking, why am I doing this?"" Well, this is why.

Your new neural pathways from being sober are going to take a bit of time to get inculcated (let's call this You 2.0) you are literally updating your own operating system now.  Branding yourself an 'addictive personality' is probably a misnomer.

You just have habits. Nothing bad or good. Just habits. Like all the other humans 😊 And soon, you will have new habits.

So, be gentle with yourself and maybe give your brain new things to 'play with.' Brains love goals and working on problems. Start thinking about what you want to accomplish today, this month, next month, next year, five years, etc.

You got his..

I’d describe myself, probably along with many others, as having been a “functional” stoner. Graduated early with several internships and decent grades. Been employed and doing pretty well at work since I left college. Fairly regular exercise routine and social life etc. 

All this is pretty good for a daily user, yeah? I used to pride myself on being a functional stoner. But the other day, I just thought...Is that really all I aspire to, all I want to be in this life? “Functional”? Why not: successful, accomplished, passionate, loving, driven, excited, vibrant, etc? Why just stop at getting by or doing “pretty well” all things considered?

If this is how I’ve managed with daily weed use, I can only imagine where I’d be without it. but it’s never too late, so here’s to a fresh start."

Replace your weed habit with something that you enjoy sober but don’t enjoy high,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eijuom/replace_your_weed_habit_with_something_that_you/,2020-01-01 19:04:07,"For example I can’t read a book when I’m high. I just don’t have the focus or mental capacity to sit there reading and actually understand what’s going on. But I love reading when I’m not high. So I did some research and found a book I knew I’d love and every time I had a craving at night I would read that book. It really helped me to initially stop smoking and it gave me something to look forward to. 

What’s something that you enjoy sober or think you could enjoy but that you usually don’t do after smoking? Maybe you like art, or baking, or working out but when you’re blazed you usually don’t bother. Try replacing the times you would be smoking with this hobby! And just like I bought a new book, maybe you could buy some new art supplies or workout gloves for example. It serves as inspiration and a reminder to indulge in that hobby rather than smoking. I hope this tip helps and cheers to a new year!"
My weed addiction snuck up on me and stayed around long after it made itself known. I have a crystal clear recollection of stumbling across r/leaves at one time and then quickly leaving because it was much too threatening. Since quitting this past June it’s been a major daily support. Thank you all.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e51erm/my_weed_addiction_snuck_up_on_me_and_stayed/,2019-12-02 19:27:46,Daily visits here give me insight and courage to stay the course. Folks who are just starting out get my comments encouraging them to go ahead and know it does get easier - that sleep returns along with ones appetite. Folks who post about relapsing evoke my profound gratitude for helping warn me of the pitfalls of thinking I can smoke ‘just this once’ without paying a price. Long term users (like me) who post their stories help me feel like less of a fool for allowing the decades to have slipped by. Every single day I live without my old habit getting the better of gives me a sense of pride as well as humility. I feel proud I have made it through another day weed-free and also deeply humbled that somehow I have managed to find the strength to avoid using. I know there are zero guarantees that this period of abstinence lasts.  I need to face every day with full resolve. Some days are much easier than others. For this addict it truly is one damn day at a time.  Thanks for reading.
I started to think I could never quit. Today I'm ONE WEEK sober!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g92ax2/i_started_to_think_i_could_never_quit_today_im/,2020-04-27 19:01:20,"Hi guys,

I've followed this community for what feels like forever now. I have tried and told myself I'd quit far too many times to ever count. The number of journal entries I have stating ""this is it!"" is embarrassing, and I really lost faith in myself and my ability to turn things around.

I was the smart girl who had her shit together until I started smoking around the age of 20. Fast forward 10 years: it had stopped being fun a long time ago. It was now serving another purpose, which was masking the ugly, painful feelings that simmered under the surface. I knew I was letting my life waste away, and I couldn't deal with it. I smoked constantly, about 1/8 a day, waking up every few hours throughout the night to smoke 3-4 bowls just so I could fall back asleep. 

I wasn't even living. I was numbing & blocking out not only the negative feelings, but EVERYTHING. Nothing felt good or brought me joy anymore. I stopped writing, making art, reading books etc. and started to become a recluse. I didn't even know who I was anymore.

Eventually the weed just wasn't doing enough for me. I started drinking more. Or I would tell myself I wouldn't smoke weed, just to get drunk and order a weed delivery a few hours later. In those moments, it felt like the only way I could cope with my own existence. 

But here I am. I haven't had weed or alcohol in a week and I'm almost in disbelief. Just wanted to share this win with a community that has helped me to feel like I'm not alone in this.

You aren't alone in this either. None of us are. Like they say over at r/stopdrinking, I will not smoke with you today."

2. My energy levels are much higher
3. I can run up a flight of stairs without feeling winded (out of breath)
4. I get hungry without needing to smoke 
5. I’m not grouchy when I don’t smoke
6. My mental health is in a much better place 
7. I’m better at video games 
8. I don’t even crave weed
9. I have more money than I know what to do with because I’m not spending $20+ a day on bud 
10. I’m happier than I’ve been in months 
11. My head is clear and I don’t just have “nonsense loops” anymore 
12. People seem to like me more (people I know and strangers alike)
13. I am fulfilled by normal activities


I don’t know how I’ve done it. It’s like my pre frontal cortex finally developed and something in my brain just clicked and somehow after struggling with every-day smoking for years, quitting became easy. I quit both Mary Jane and vaping at the same time and it’s incredible all the benefits I’ve seen in such a short period of time. I believe in every single one of the wonderful people on this sub, you guys can do it!"

Hi Leavers👋🏻If you sort posts by new you can see if someone else has just posted what you might be about to so you two can relate together👩🏼‍🤝‍👨🏻Try seeking out unanswered posts to make someone feel seen.

We all like to be seen, acknowledged. If you've got the time, look for a post with no replies and if you can relate or offer support give them a moment of your time. Takes a lot of courage to post here for some people. Not me obviously I never shut up 🤷🏼‍♀️ but in the sometimes scary and lonely world of addiction sometimes one comment can brighten the room enough for someone to have hope again. 

By sorting by new instead of what's hot not only may you catch a post while the poster is still online so you can actually almost talk and relate in real time (and they may have just posted the same thing you were going to) but you may catch someone posting who's about to relapse and asking for help. And although it's no one else's responsibility at all, simply encouraging them not to may be enough in that moment of weakness.

Comments that my skin looks great, that I generally  “look good” etc. But beyond appearance - I also just notice that my interactions are higher quality. People seem to respond better to me on a level that isn’t necessarily verbal. Can’t really explain it.

It’s becoming clear, based on my interactions in the world, that I vibrate higher when not smoking."

That I long for them to stop talking to me so that I can finish my shit and go home to my bowl.  That I wonder if I'm broken because I'd rather be hanging out alone with weed instead of taking a moment to hear their story.  I have truly stopped listening to others because I just want to go home to my comfort zone and listen to my own thoughts whirling as I inhale smoke. 

There was a time that it complimented my life and personality so very well.  I miss those days but I'm too smart to sit here in denial.  I'm wise enough to know that sobriety is worth a committed pursuit.  It is a tragedy to spend years  simply wondering if I am better off without it.  It is time to see!"

If you’re thinking about taking a leave, just know I believe in you. If I can do it, so can you. My biggest tip for someone who’s ready to quit, is don’t force it.

36 hours weed free after the most miserable weekend of my adult life,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hulbtv/36_hours_weed_free_after_the_most_miserable/,2020-07-20 17:34:34,"Yesterday I came home from the most miserable weekend of my life. My bf and his “best friend” had quickly planned a camping trip for the three of us, plus the friend’s ex girlfriend. They spent the entire weekend bickering with each other, It was extremely nasty and toxic, culminating in a screaming match fit for /publicfreakouts and them almost actually getting into a physical fight yesterday. I cried every single day this weekend because of their bullshit. We are all stoners, though I have been tapering my weed usage for the last 6 months or so, and am the only one who can admit that it might be addictive or a problem for any of us. 

It’s incredible 1. How much everyone had to smoke to tolerate each other and 2. How nasty and full of rage so-called “mellow stoners” can be. My bfs friend has a total inability to communicate when things are bothering him, just acts like everything is fine, expects people to read his dissatisfaction from his sarcastic tone, and meanwhile he is seething with rage inside from every perceived slight (whether real or imagined), that of course inevitably bursts.

I am just so disgusted with everyone’s behavior. Despite us all being in our 30s-40s, I felt like there was not a single adult on the trip. All the while everything is bandaged over with weed. We will all probably never hang out as a group again and all our friendships have been irreparably harmed. 

Yesterday was a turning point for me. Despite the high stress situation and it being offered to me constantly all day, I didn’t have a single hit of weed. I don’t want this future. I am not like these people. I do not use weed to make myself numb to a horrible situation. I am learning to deal with difficult emotions with a clear sober head."

ER trip convinced me enough is enough. Long post... sorry.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/geaiv0/er_trip_convinced_me_enough_is_enough_long_post/,2020-05-06 05:19:33,"I've tried quitting pot before. Oh, I've tried. I've bagged up my grinders and pieces and fresh bud and thrown them out. I've done it several times. I'd just go buy new stuff a week later, spending even more money. I'd smoke through the flu, making things worse. For the last 8 years I smoked almost every day, even after a double hernia surgery. I've spent all of my 20s in a haze. I have a degree in piano and for 7 years I've wasted all the skills I worked so hard to develop. I have stagnated for 8 years on developing marketable job skills. I have spent 8 years chasing a neverending high and playing video games, and not improving as a person. 

My little sister died last year and she knew me as a pothead. She's the only one in my family who knew what I really was. I have held onto that loss so tightly that I feared ever quitting weed because I thought I needed it to retain my sanity and manage my lifelong hypochondria and anxiety. 

Friday night I wasn't feeling so great and went to bed early. The next morning I smoked a little weed and an hour later my heart began racing and I couldn't breathe. I thought I was having a heart attack. I'm perfectly healthy so I was very scared and went to the ER. I never ever go to the hospital so I didn't even know where to park. The doc told me I likely had an anxiety attack... and diagnosed me with pleurisy. My breath is short, and it's uncomfortable in my chest. It is only mild, but any time I tried smoking last week, I felt the symptoms - it took an ER trip to convince me to stop smoking. 

The last few days have been a nightmare. Although Tylenol is making the pleurisy much better and completely manageable, I am having a hard time adjusting to reality sober. I can't sit down and play video games because I get bored quickly. No weed? Can't sit there for hours playing Animal Crossing and Red Dead 2. Just can't think or focus. I want to be high, but I'm a lazy motherfucker who is still dragging himself out of addiction and can't bring myself to concentrate on active hobbies. I am laying in bed with insane hunger pangs even though I just ate.

I cannot remember the last time I was sober this long. I never want to go to the ER again. I just want the stomach pangs and discomfort to go away, I want my appetite back to normal, I want to have a zest for life again. I want to play the piano again and actually learn to enjoy things without weed again. I cannot enter my 30s living paycheck to paycheck, doing nothing with my life under the illusion that it's fine to just do nothing all fucking day all fucking year long. My best friend just had a kid. I do not want that kid to grow up and be more accomplished than I will be at 50.

I want to be free. I'm on day 3. I realize I'm addicted. I realize I will always be an addict. But I'm not going to be a slave anymore. I'm sick of this shit. It isn't worth it anymore. 

If you read all this... thank you. I just need someone to tell me it's going to get better. I'm going to try to go back to sleep now. If you have any advice... please give it. Sleep and Tylenol and bottles of water are my biggest friends. I just tossed out ALL my paraphernalia, again. Hopefully for the last time. 

I can do this. I know I can.

EDIT: It's the following morning and there's almost 300 upvotes on this and dozens of comments of love and support. This community rules. Thank you so much for the support. Nighttime is dreadful for some reason. I still have to get up and go to work, so I'm actually thankful for this bit of routine, because it will help occupy my mind throughout most of the day. I'll check back in over time. Much love, everyone.

EDIT #2: Wow, a silver award. That's my first ever Reddit award! The love just keeps on flowing... I'm stunned. You all are making day #4 such a warm experience. I hope tonight is easier than last night's, but it may get worse like some of you said. But I know I can get through this with all your help.

Simple advice given by an Ayahuasca Shaman about weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/68v6g2/simple_advice_given_by_an_ayahuasca_shaman_about/,2017-05-02 23:06:02,"A few months ago I attended an Ayahuasca ceremony, for numerous reasons; but one of the reasons was to heal myself from the damage weed has caused in my Self and my life. 

The ceremony begins with a blessing and a ritual, and then everyone drinks their first cup of Aya. After about an hour and a half, if anyone wants a second cup, they can go to the Shaman and request a second cup. The Shaman gauges how you're feeling, and determines if you do indeed need that second cup. I went up for a second cup, because I felt comfortable and wanted to deepen the experience. 

Right before he handed me the second cup, he paused and said: ""What are you doing here? What do you want?""

I told him I was there for a few reasons, but as it related to weed I said, ""I'm hoping that Ayahuasca can help heal the damage I believe I've done to my brain from smoking so much cannabis for so long. I feel as if it's caused me to become dim-witted and slow. I've lost my ability to connect with myself and others.""

He handed me the second cup and right before I drank it he said, ""Before you drink that second cup, I want you to think of your situation differently. Instead of being concerned about, and focusing on all the negative things cannabis has brought into your life...simply focus on the positive things she brought into your life while you were together. Thank her for that. And move on.""  

It's a simple, yet powerful message. 

It's akin to having an amicable break up, rather than having a tumultuous, argument and resent-filled break up. 

Thank you, Cannabis, for being my companion during the good times. Thank you for providing me with spiritual insights, creativity, and forcing me to question the status quo. I respect you and appreciate what you provided; but we both know that we are no longer a suitable match. On to bigger and better things - being fully present, engaged and alive in this beautiful existence. "

edit: I feel so much less alone now, guys. I was pretty sure I'd end up in bed getting high all day, but I'm not gonna do that any more. I hope to keep hearing from you all, even if I can't respond to everyone. We can all do it, someway somehow <3"
A quote from a philosopher that really spoke to me,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hpvj9h/a_quote_from_a_philosopher_that_really_spoke_to_me/,2020-07-12 18:47:40,"Marcus Aurelius: ""At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”

So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?

You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.""

Obviously, this is about getting out of bed. But I feel like it has a lot in common with what we struggle with here. Weed stops us from doing what we need to do. We werent born to simply ""feel nice."" Staying in bed all day, or getting high, are simple, short term pleasures that stop us from obtaining more long lasting goals.

Not an actual conversation that happened lol. Look, I’ve had a lot of fun in my life. I’ve smoked weed for a little over a decade and had many forgotten unforgettable moments. Kind of beautiful really, the level of companionship that a shared joint can bring. So I’ll miss that, and I think there will be some mourning involved in acknowledging that that phase is passing. But I’m technically in my late 20’s now. I want to start a family and lean into my potential and be financially secure. I can’t do that when I’m up in the clouds a few times a week. I think, ultimately, the most concerning side effect of marijuana is that it makes you content with living your average life. Yes there are benefits, of course, and many lessons the plant has to teach, but it’s a double edged sword and it can’t be held on forever without hurting your potential. I’ve attempted a few times to quit, but this time feels different."

I get to be reliable for my friends and my obligations. I get to shower and brush myself instead of passing out in bed. Those are all things that I didn’t have by the end of my using.

it’s been hard, i’ve had a few cravings within the past week but i soldiered through it and said ‘NO’ and didn’t smoke. 

things i’ve noticed :

• i can remember things. 

• i’m more productive. 

• i like to cook more and my appetite has increased to where i’m eating 3+ meals a day. 

• i’m more self aware. 

• my hair is growing and actually darkened back to its natural color (dark, dark brown / black). 

• mood swings. 

• dental health has been a complete 180. 

• i’ve picked up some of my hobbies again, including painting, playing my nintendo, etc. i haven’t picked up reading again but i hope to get there. 

i also want to say that i’m proud of you all too, whether you’re going strong or you relapsed. at least you’re trying and even though you may not succeed the first time, YOU ARE WORKING TO BETTER YOURSELF. 

update coming next week, thank you all for your support ❤️"
That moment when you are stoned on your bed thinking what the fuck am I doing is when you know.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i712kp/that_moment_when_you_are_stoned_on_your_bed/,2020-08-10 12:32:57,"At that exact moment, you realise that, yes there is something wrong. Tomorrow will be the day when I go to sleep sober and wake up clear headed and go around enjoy this drug called life.

But then next night you are back at it. The circle continues.

But don't get discouraged.

You will feel low.

You will feel depressed.

You will automatically start rolling.


But then, think about that moment. That moment when, laying there stoned, you felt helpless and shit, and said this is it. Hold on to that feeling, own that feeling. Think about how you never want to feel that way.

And let go.

Just go for a walk. Go, do something that will take your mind off this. 

Slowly you can and will take back control of your life. 


3 months sober and proud.

Edit: 5 months. Wasn't keeping count. Had to check my first post on this sub to confirm. You see once you take yourself out of the equation, and get used to being sober, it becomes a habit.

Today i am 4 months sober and my life has turned upside down.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/glqskr/today_i_am_4_months_sober_and_my_life_has_turned/,2020-05-18 04:20:19,"I first noticed when i was laying in my bed, ready to sleep that today is 4 months since i last smoked weed.

Back then all i did was sitting on my computer day in, day out. Doing absolutely nothing with my life. I met with some friends ocasionally to smoke some more weed, since that was what we had in common. A waste of my life. But at the time i really didnt knew better. It was like i already had given up on my future, my dreams, my family. It was a vicious circle of feeling bad = smoking more.

4 months ago i had a dream. A dream i will never forget. The first dream in many years. I usually never dream when i have smoked weed. But this time i did. I have a son. 1 year old at the time of my dream. He was the one present in my dream. He told me to stop. Or else him and mom would leave me. I woke up in tears and was so confused about the whole situation. Specially because i know my boy cant “speak” yet, and it was like i heard his true voice for the first time. I stood up, took all my weed, and flushed it down the toilet. I never looked back.

Today i have the best relationship with my boy, and my girlfriend. I now have my own business producing musicvideoes and commercials. I love it! My dream. A dream since i was 9 years old and got my first camera in a present from my dad.
I feel like i matter to people now. It is truly strong and a wonderful feeling. 

I know YOU can do it as well! 

Stop smoking and do what you dream of doing.

I just realized why I'm not feeling the satisfaction of quitting I'd hope I'd have by now (day 107),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e6fgda/i_just_realized_why_im_not_feeling_the/,2019-12-05 13:36:04,"I spent most of my life from ages 14-20 high. I barely had friends and my grades were dropping. Last year, I got some bad news about something personal, so smoking the feelings away felt like the best way to deal with that. 

I quit weed right before the beginning of my junior year of college, which was 107 days ago. If you had asked me what I think I'd feel like after 100+ days being sober, I couldn't even tell you because that's unimaginable. Last year, going 4 days without weed was a rare occasion & accomplishment. 

All around, I'm a better version of me than my old sedentary-baked-potato self. I don't think about weed nearly as much anymore. But still...there's this feeling of achievement that I'd thought I'd have by now, and I don't. This made me feel very discouraged throughout the 107 day (so far) process. 

Last year, I had one basic daily routine: wake up, go to class (or don't), eat, do some homework, smoke, eat again, watch tv, go to bed, repeat. If I was feeling social, I'd ask my roommate to smoke with me. I was failing a class and I was avoiding all the problems that were happening in my life. 

Sometimes when I got high, I'd lay on the shower floor for a long time. Now I've been taking very short showers to save time/water. But I have a cold right now, so earlier today I figured I'd chill in the steamy shower for a bit. While I was letting the water fall on my chest, I felt weirdly nostalgic. For a few minutes, I felt like last-year me laying on the shower floor. And in a way, I felt jealous of her...because she was *comfortable*. She was okay with the fact that she was literally doing nothing all day. 

Then, I had a shower thought (literally). I realized why I don't feel ""achieved."" Because I am achiev**ing**. I am go**ing** through an extreme process of change. I'm becom**ing** familiar with the true, sober version of me. I haven't made too many friends, but I am try**ing**. I'm not getting amazing grades, but I'm study**ing.** Hardest of all, I am cop**ing** with my feelings. 

Point is, that ""achievement/satisfaction/whatever"" I was hoping to feel after 100+ days is never going to come, because I am never going to stop changing. If I hadn't begun my process of change, I'd be 107 days behind from who I am now, and I am currently years behind from who I will be one day. Sitting on the shower floor reminded me of my comfort zone that I no longer have anymore. I quit weed because I was not okay with the fact that I was okay doing nothing. I may be far from who I want to be, but at least I'm doing something to get there."
Being addicted to weed is like pressing the pause button on your life while time keeps running. Only to find out later that you pressed that button for years and you'll never get that time back again.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/733vin/being_addicted_to_weed_is_like_pressing_the_pause/,2017-09-29 03:11:30,"This thought suddenly popped up while sitting here, high as fuck, on a bench all alone outside. I have tried to quit for years and now time really starts counting.

I lost friends, girlfriends and family who died, and it just passed by in a fraction of a second, while feeling numb the whole time. Not being capable of seeing your family on a regular basis. Suddenly they're gone and you realize that you've spend that whole time high and just threw time away. And most of all: all those years of potential and developing yourself dissapeared and you just lag behind and stood still, while everyone and everything moved on.

Personal story:

I'm 22, started at 16. OCD from childhood came back hard by smoking that I basically became a hermit.

My OCD is about unlucky numbers and rituals, freaking out of numbers of the month (roughly 2/3 of the month are ""unlucky days'' to quit). Put it simple: if I quit on those days I feel anxious, my OCD literally thinks that someone could die/I'd not reach my goals if I quit on an ''unlucky day''. Even on the ""normal""  days I can't quit because then ''I'd avoid beating my OCD"". On top of that I also have tinnitus..

I try to quit literally everyday with cigs and weed and every morning the anxiety starts to kick in hard. It got to the point I dropped out of college, and now spend my evenings outside all alone with weed and a beer. Hell, I even want to quit today but my sister will quit smoking in two days and so I can't quit because I don't want to associate ""my quit with hers''. This provokes tremendous anxiety to me, strangely.. OCD always finds a way..

It even got to the point I stole money from my dad just to get weed, ride the bike 50 km for a gram. Got kicked out for a while.. I have basically become pathetic.

It all started with a suicide attempt at 16, from then on I started sleeping 14 hours a day and throwing years of life away. Before anyone asks, I get professional help, but I just don't feel understood by anyone, I always felt different like I didn't fit in. It's so weird that my OCD is mixed with my addictions. I want to quit when everything is perfect but that will sadly never happen. 

I managed to quit 3 times for a couple of weeks and felt like a different person, it's just that this OCD holds me as a prisoner and keeps making me lose so much time and energy..

2. I would put so much effort into moderating and controlling and I would spend all this energy and stress thinking about it, to the point where it eclipses the benefits. It’s honestly easier to just remove weed from the equation altogether, rather than trying to make it fit. 

3. I love the feeling of weed so much that I don’t even know what moderate use looks like. I can’t even imagine it now. Nights only? I’ll miss wake and bake. Weekends only? There goes my weekend and personal life. 1 joint a week? I’d be pissed the other 6 days, waiting for the next one. And in 5 minutes it will become daily, then hourly. 

Honestly, I have failed spectacularly at moderation. And I am doing pretty good at recovery. I think I would rather stick it out, rather than strike another deal with the devil."

That was the last time I smoked. In the days that have followed I have:

-Attended inspections for places to rent and had a return contact on an application. I've lived with my Mum since seperating from my partner of 12 years, treating my depression with weed and doing nothing to fix my situation.

-Cleaned and organised everything within my limited space, my room, my car and workspace. Allowing me to feel in control of what I have left.

-Actually enjoyed my downtime and taking genuine interest in my hobbies.

-Woken up every day feeling prepared for my responsibilities, not bracing myself for them.

When I was high by myself, I would lie to myself. It isn't who I am and it isn't who you are. Listen to that voice, listen to your gut, it's you, trying to make contact through the thick haze.

In the past three weeks I slowly but surely got back into the mentality of “ill just try it once to see”, romanticizing the hell out of it. 

And within 5 minutes, I was filled with regret. Not only because of the fact that I broke by streak, but because it was very far from enjoyable and not at all what I expected it to be. It made me realize I love having a clear mind, and it may be tough to realize at times just how precious being sober is but I really do believe it’s better than any drug. Some of you might be out there considering going back very heavily, weighing out the reasons, but I promise it’s not worth it. I didn’t even smoke that much and was left feeling extremely antisocial and self conscious, forgetting what was being talked about/what I was going to say, feeling plain stupid, and unable to keep track of the conversations that were being held. 

I think it’s gotten to a point where my body has just been there and done that. It’s not special to me any more. To all those of you out there reading this, I promise you that you will grow to like being sober and having a clear mind, you just have to persevere and trust not only the process, but also yourself fully at all times. Once you see it, weed is nowhere near as fun as it used to be, and is a waste of an opportunity to be sober and truly capture and embrace whatever moment you are in. The idea that it will make you feel good is nothing but an illusion because either you’ll regret it later or right away. 

In a way I’m actually glad I smoked, because I now truly see that my body is over weed. Smoking over 2,000 times made it become old and bland. I promise to every single one of you that the grass is greener on the other side, and that most importantly, you can do it. Have faith in yourself. Appreciate having a clear mind and being sober because it truly is precious. 

Thanks for reading this. If there’s even one person out there I can convince not to smoke, I’ll be more than happy. Take care and be the best version of yourselves that you can be."

I know the first thought when feeling these things is something like “wow if I smoke I am so much more productive” or whatever — I’m here to remind you that is a false choice.

We’ve been flooding our brain with an influx of chemicals e.g dopamine, and it’s going to take time for our brains to adjust to a normal level again. 

Trust the process - trust your body’s ability to heal itself. It will get better. Stay strong."
[Day 360] Just got accepted into Med School; almost threw away one year of sobriety.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cma1lm/day_360_just_got_accepted_into_med_school_almost/,2019-08-05 15:56:23,"Hey guys I am typing this on mobile so apologies if I make some typos. 

I made a few posts here quite a while ago about my story, why I quit and little updates during the first few months without weed. I just wanted to share with you guys that today I got the confirmation that I got accepted into med school and also that I have my 1 year anniversary coming up. Honestly, months 1-11 were surprisingly easy. I barely had any cravings and sobriety quickly became the new normal. 

In July I took the entrance exam for medical university here in Austria after studying really hard for 3 months straight. Honestly, after the exam I had the horrible feeling that I fucked it up and soon after my self destructive tendencies came up again. I began drinking beer on my own and playing video games all day. After a week of that I went back to my home city to spend some time with my mum, my cats and my girlfriend. While I was there I also began hanging out with my deadbeat stoner friend again who also was my hookup back in the stoner days. He was ripping his disgusting bong, weed mixed with rolling tobacco, while I was sipping beer and watching him cough up half a lung after every hit before he slipped into the somnolent haze that is the marijuana high.


After a few days of saying no and declining his offers of smoking, eventually I caved and when he told me he was gonna go pick up I pitched in with a 20. Honestly, I felt wrong and bad about it while I said it and while I was waiting for him to return. Deep down I didn't really want to get high again. Deep down I really didn't want to disappoint my girlfriend who had been so supportive and proud of me quitting. Yet I said nothing.

When he came back, me and him had a little falling out. He was with some friend of his and I think he wanted to show to his friend that he could boss me around or belittle me or something. He was high as a kite and trying to play some mind games with me. 
After a minute or two of arguing I said fuck this, I'm out and went back home. I let him keep the 20 bag and just walked home. 

On the way home I felt so, so happy I didn't partake. I felt really reaffirmed in my decision to abstain and also thankful that he decided to be a petty dick that day because if he hadn't I would have definitely relapsed.

So today I got the email that I passed, finishing 71st out of 5000 people, and on Friday I will go to the university and officially enlist.
After years of fucking around and achieving nothing of substance except substance abuse I finally have a clear goal and career path in front of me and that is to become a great fucking doctor.

Thank you guys for reading and I wish every single one of you all the best. We are all in this together."

Everyone has a different journey and I hope we all make it till the end we just have to power through and remind ourselves why we quit in the first place."
I quit in 2019 here’s how it went,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ekwptm/i_quit_in_2019_heres_how_it_went/,2020-01-06 19:53:35,"Last year my resolution was to stop smoking pot. I’d been constantly high for nearly 25 years. Wake and bake. Smoke a lunch again mid afternoon then before going home then again after dinner. You get the point. 

It was tough going. The first two or three weeks were the toughest. I had little energy. I was in a shitty mood. I doubt I was fun to live with. I told myself constantly that if I just smoked again I’d be fine. But I realized that voice in my head was wrong. I ignored it and moped through the first three weeks of the year. Then started feeling better. A lot better. 

I felt smarter. I realized I was more present. I forced myself to reconnect with friends and to make new connections with other people in my neighborhood. 

I told myself I was cured then smoked a little in Feb. the plan was moderation but that didn’t happen. I had to go through shorty withdrawal feeling again.  I treated that same cycle again in the summer. 

Then I stopped, like, for real. Now I nearly never crave it. Like where you’re consumed with it can can think of nothing else. However I still think about smoking nearly every day, but it’s like a passing thought. Like, remember how I used to always smoke before X. 

Can’t encourage you all to stay on the path. If you stopped on New Years stick with it. My marriage is better. My life is better. I’m making more money and am generally happier. You can be too. 

And the real kicker? I used to say “I need to smoke to calm down”. Eventually I realized that I’m more calm now that I don’t smoke and a lot of the stuff I was coping with was DUE TO weed, not solved by it. 

Hope you find out the same thing. Shout out to everyone on this sub. Huge help."
So fucking scared to do this.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/co1qar/so_fucking_scared_to_do_this/,2019-08-09 16:32:04,"Literally tears of terror are in my eyes as I type right now.  I need to stop smoking to get my life together. I'm 31 now and had my first toke at 14. The next day I became a daily user who was proud to only have missed about 3 weeks of smoking over the past 17 years. I grew up with weed, i grew up high all the time. Getting high at my private, unisex high school during lunch and again otw home. Wake n bake in the car otw there the next morning. Point is I made it all through high school high, graduated with a 3.6 gpa (high af), played varsity sports ( a little high) and started taking my  talents for granted. Meanwhile I am teaching myself to play music. Formin a rock band from my peers, we smoked out every practice. In fact i remember the bass player leaving bc we were getting high instead of practicing. 

Weed became part of the very fabric that held my life together. There were no emotions in high school after weed. I convinced myself I made better music when high. And if you study high and take the test high you get high grades, like the drunken call back in beerfest the movie.

Then Hurricane Katrina hits my city in my Senior year. Mass devestation, lose every possession except for 2 guitars and a bag of hand me down trinkets my Great Grandfather had given me. Evacuate to a smallish town. ""Great, wheres the weed guy here?"" - I quickly found the source in my new town. So, I make it to a party. Find the pot heads, blow down. Rinse and repeat until graduation. (Also started using ecstasy pretty heavily until graduation)

Summer before college, come back to hometown, rebuild with my parents. Well partially until i realized i couldnt get high in the fema trailers with everyone else around, so i left and went to stay with a friend and his parents. WTF! WHO FUCKING DOES THAT? 18 y/o and like nah mom and dad, ""i cant live i  such cramped quarters"". I was a little ungrateful bitch. That didnt have the tools to deal with emotion. Most of high school is a fuzzy blur. I remember faces and some names but again, its all very unclear.

At this point you are probably thinking I am a total burnout, but the truth is I am still functional. Or at least I was until college started.

Get to university for orientation. Find pot heads, get high, miss all entrance exams. Have to take remedial classes which ultimately caused me to take summer classes later to graduate on time. More on that later.
The rest of college is filled with memories of bright lights, drunk nights and heartbreak.

 Year 1 of University, I meet my first really serious girlfriend. We smoked, took some molly, woke up naked alongside each other. Couldnt remember her name or where we were. But holy shit there was a naked chick in my bed and that hadn't happened before, I love college! We start dating, she takes xanax like its prescribed. Went through 5 years of what i now call pain management. We were toxic for each other. Couldnt have a good time unless we were both high. Her family loved me so that counted for a whole lot. Especially bc i kind of black sheep'd myself in my family. So i was seeking validation from her parental units and not even conversating with my own. Especially her dad. He was a cool S.O.B. Worked as a top dog for a barge company on the river $$$. But it wasnt because he was cool, I have come to realize I wanted his support more than the rest of the family because my Bio- dad left before I was born. 

So I have been trying to fill this hole in my soul/heart whatever using everyone and everything but myself to overcome it. Her and I break up. It was a critical point in my life, the first time I though weed might be the prlblem and not the cure.... nah fuck that toke it up, fuck that bitch, amirite?

I cant remember shit anymore. We are now in post graduate working life. I take the first job offer that doesnt test for pot, youre looking at the newest most promising salesman to step foot into a ... Guitar Center. ???? Really? 4 years of music education and you go into retail sales? Not what I expected to do. But lets be real. I never had ambition or goals at the time because i had been high for the better half of a decade. So i work there for 5 years, start looking how to get out.

Meet an old friend at GC who tells me his job is hiring. 80 bucks and a fake urine sample later, I employed at a warehouse counting boxes all day! Guess what makes that more fun? You got it. Weeed! Until you drop all the ketchup from the top shelf because you hit the gas and not the break on the forklift. So I started slowing down smoking. 1 time a day. That lasted about 2 years before I  left and started a new job. I moved on to work as a service writer in a body shop. Chasing a bigger check. Bc at this point I realized I am too far removed from university to go back for something else ( boy was I wrong) so lets move forward with people who will train me

Today I am a car salesman, i went from having all the potential in the world to car sales and most of how I got here is a blur. I dont work out anymore bc i am at work between 10 and 11 hours a day now and not really making money. I cant take any well paying technical jobs bc I have a music degree and still piss dirty. And on top of all that, my 2nd serious relationship in life ended 3 days ago. I am in therapy once a week now and i can see how it will benefit me in the long run. But I cant help but feeling like weed is a major roadblock in my life.

Since her and I broke up, I have only been able to eat and sleep with the aid of weed. But i can't think. So i sober up a little to make it through the day and then the emotions crush me. Literally leave the office to go bawl my eyes out in the car. She says that its not about weed or anything related to it since she smokes too, but I can definitely see how it caused issues in the relationship. By the time Lunch comes around Im looking for my oil pen every god damn day. I just want to be able to be sober and make real connections with people again. Think through a problem and have it solved. Ive spent half of my life in a fucking fog. No wonder why nothing seems beautiful anymore and why I long for the feeling we get as kids when you see something dreamy and it gives you hope that your life could be that beautiful. My life has had its own beauty, but it also hasnt really been my life. That wasnt me making decisions I was hiding behind the shell of a 20 something year old.

Todays the day fam. Today is day 1. Ive got the chills just typing that out. Fuck theres power in admission. Here's to a better future. And if I can do this. You can do this.


EDIT: to the kind soul who thought my words hold a monetary value. I cant tell you how much i appreciate the Gold and the comforting words waiting on the other side. 2nd best decision I have made all year was to open up to a bunch of strangers on Reddit. Best decision was to get clean and deal with my emotional stresses. Thank you all. I am here for you too. Dm if you want to talk.

2nd edit: Platinum... ya'll are too much. Just read it. Let it resonate. Know you're not alone. And most of all we have to remember we are bettering ourselves. And thats the reason to quit!"
Clean and sober.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dinhin/clean_and_sober/,2019-10-16 14:41:58,"I'd like to share my story. I am a Dutch woman of 65. I started smoking hashies when I was 14 and did so for 44 years. I would always say I was not addicted because I didn't smoke when I was on holiday. Needless to say I always found people to smoke with. But the last years of my life long habit I was very bored with it. I smoked all day and was bored. Finally I found the opportunity to go into rehab and I did and after the first three weeks in which you are supposed to stop, I stopped. It was very very hard. I could not sleep, my mind was running but everyone assured me it would get better. And also the times I wanted to smoke would pass. I believed them. They were right. I was so afraid to stop but there was nothing to be afraid of. I love to have a clear head. I am so happy I stopped. It has been 8 years now. I have never longed for a smoke. Never want that feeling of being stoned again. Thanks for reading."

This is a group to which I belong: the sleepers/creepers. 
We're here, intermittently throwing an upvote someone's way, but more often than not we just read what everyone else is saying (if it's been a tough week, we might be pushed into posting something).

We're not generally the people who help and give advice in these posts. Personally, I can never find the right words. My thoughts always seem too personal to help anyone else out.

Thankfully, there are others out there. Those of you who are able to turn your experiences into reports which can help other people through difficult times. 

Thank you for doing this. It's such a relief to have a community to return to. To think about cannabis a couple of times in a day, go onto Reddit and see that I'm not alone - that none of us are.

Without all your constant work this place wouldn't exist, so on behalf of the people who can't bring themselves to do it, but find solace in the company of others, thank you in all sincerity."

Said to me from my substance abuse counselor who’s been practicing for 40 years. After thinking about it some I tend to agree with her. Aside from the physical withdrawal, the hardest part is finding a new way to live, changing habits, discovering new ways to spend time and energy, developing new interests, and tackling underlying mental health issues. It’s been just over 5 months for me, and I can see how I’ve failed to call it quits in the past. I never put any effort into changing my life beyond just not smoking.

I thought I had damaged my brain!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fd0u78/i_thought_i_had_damaged_my_brain/,2020-03-03 23:23:26,"Long time lurker, first time poster here,

After smoking daily for 27 years I decided to give up last August and here I am 195 days since my last joint. However I'm not here on a victory lap to bask in my wonderful achievement (though I am proud of myself I must say). It's more to offer reassurance to those who feel they may have caused irreparable damage to their brain and their capacity to learn new things. This was a real concern to me prior to quitting; my short term memory was fucked and my capacity to retain new information was seemingly non existent. I knew however that if I was to successfully quit for good  I would need to replace my one and only hobby (getting stoned, sad but true!) with something else, so I decided that I would study Spanish 28 years since I studied it in school. 

Fast forward through the nightmare of the initial few  weeks of withdrawal symptoms (mainly horrendous insomnia coupled with crushing anxiety). I finally sat down to study Spanish; having previously been able to speak to a fairly decent level (B2) I was shocked at just how much I had forgotten. To the extent that I had to relearn using Duolingo. However within a few weeks of studying and further sobriety it all came flooding back but I guess it stands to reason that I hadn't forgotten, it was just laying dormant. What has really surprised me though has been my capacity to learn new vocabulary and new grammar. I estimate that I have learnt in the region of 500 words in the last 6 months in additional to learning more advanced grammar. I am now able to watch and follow Spanish TV every evening. Something  a year ago I would have thought impossible. 

My brain wasn't damaged, isn't damaged, it was just being held hostage for 27 years!

So my message to those of you who feel you have lost the capacity to learn, to advance yourself and to reinvent yourself, you really haven't! Trust me your brain is absolutely fine, it's ready and waiting for your motivation to come along and wake it up and achieve whatever you want to achieve!

Break that Stockholm syndrome. 

Good luck!"
Ask yourself — Why do I feel the need to continually alter my reality with weed? What is it about my reality that I’m trying to escape?

It’s important to recognize the connection between these three. They, like the three legs of a stool, depend upon each other for overall stability. Healthy eating, exercise, meditation/yoga . . . these are the three legs of my stool. 

Speaking of, it’s 4:30 am, time to sit in quiet meditation, then do a little yoga, then go for a run, then eat a healthy breakfast. Then go to work feeling energized and rejuvenated.

I’m a 41 year old male and I smoked for 26 years. I quit drinking 11 years ago as I also had an alcohol addiction. I thought for a very long time that I needed marijuana to cope with my anxiety and depression, though I finally realized that it was ultimately making these conditions worse. I’m currently 7 months weed free. Do I still miss smoking? Yes, sometimes. But the cravings are getting fewer and further between. It’s amazing how much clearer my mind is. I didn’t even realize the fog I’d been living in. I don’t want to go back. My kids have a completely sober and present dad now, something I didn’t have as a kid. My wife has a completely sober and present husband. She’s proud of me. I’m proud of myself for the first time in a very long time. I feel light and free and genuinely happy and content for once. Sobriety is feeling pretty darn good.

Or the apartment where I hung out with a older drug dealer all day to smoke for free (even though I was sexually harassed by his friends constantly).

Looking back, my life completely vanished once I turned 16. Everything and anything involved smoking weed, getting weed, and dealing with the high.

Before then, I was a starting varsity lacrosse player, with good grades and genuine friendships. That all vanished once I started smoking. Now I'm 24, the same stoner as before, with nothing interesting to share. Weed makes you boring and dull.

What moment made you realize you had to stop?"
Today is my one-year anniversary of quitting smoking weed!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f2gjqa/today_is_my_oneyear_anniversary_of_quitting/,2020-02-12 01:41:23,"Dear adorable, striving, hopeful, desperate, lucky Leavers:

If I could do it, so can you! I smoked regularly for 5+ years, grew a huge crop in my backyard, sold weed, and had over a pound of bud in the house when I decided NO MORE. 

I was so miserable and depressed the year before I quit.  I finally quit on Feb. 11, 2019. 

It wasn't easy. I had a few relapses on edibles during the past year but each time I realized how sucky weed is for me. I am SO SO GLAD that I quit! 

I am no longer as depressed, anxious, hopeless and stuck. I am exercising more, I'm stronger physically and mentally, I'm present, optimistic and hopeful.  

I'm so grateful for the support I received along the way. 

If you have any doubts that your weed use is holding you back, I urge you to take the journey I did, and quit. Quit today. Cold turkey. Throw it all away. 

YOU ARE NOT A STONER! YOU ARE A LEAVER! 

Love to all.

- night is now when I have the most adventures, up mountains and in castles and beneath lakes and with the most weird of characters

- my erections are quicker and firmer but I no longer feel the need to appease the fella

- sudden surplus of cash, essentially a 3k pay-rise

- renewed confidence in myself and less social anxiety, now that I don't have the secret shame of addiction

- actually able to remember shit from the films and documentaries I enjoy

- no longer wasting my evenings, aching for bedtime to arrive to smoke my one-a-day

- my desire to interact with others feels at a normal level rather than overwhelming reluctance

- my sentences are more coherent, and mental arithmetic is once again a pleasurable breeze"

It's day 2 and I can't even function properly. I'm constantly screaming, absolutely fucking enraged at the wind blowing the wrong way, I can't play video games with my friends which is literally one of the only things I genuinely enjoyed.

I know it gets better, but fuck. Right now I just want to curl up with a 12 gauge and not wake up tomorrow. I hate my fucking job, I can't see my fucking kid, my life is in fucking shambles and the one escape I had from this shit, is gone for good. The world being in the state it's in right now doesn't help either. I can't go five fucking feet without absolutely snapping at something so small it doesn't even matter.

When I first got to College, I was a completely different person. I was full of life, I had a personality, I could make people laugh, I had wit and it was easy. I had friends, women were romantically interested in me, I was...well, normal. I always struggled a bit with social anxiety, but when I wasn’t abusing weed, I could swallow those feelings and put on my extrovert mask and go to parties and still enjoy myself in social settings. I started smoking in high school, but I only really reached abuse-levels in college.

It was all downhill from there. I nearly failed out of college, and became gradually more withdrawn as my abusive habit grew. This led to my social anxiety inevitably taking a stronger hold over me. Weed only exacerbated that issue. I’ve been lonely for a long time. I had a friend here and there, but mostly I have just felt empty and lonely. I gained weight, stopped exercising and taking care of myself, and this affected my confidence which only made the social anxiety worse. By the end of college, I barely could recognize myself when I looked in the mirror.

When I wasn’t high, I hated myself. I hated the person I let myself become. And I could never find any other form of relief for this pain, the pain of self-hatred. The only relief was weed, which of course was the cause of all my issues. Even though I have smoked for 17 years, I’ve always been aware deep down of that fact, and how dangerous it was. Weed helped me forget the reality of all the career opportunities I’d lost, of how uncomfortable I felt in my own skin, of how alien I felt in social situations, of the damage I’d done to my mental and physical health.

Enough is enough. I will try to face my self-hatred and change whatever I have to change for these feelings to stop. I want a social life again. I want to be physically fit again. I want my personality back. Hey Mary Jane, seriously fuck you, you were an abusive lover to me in every possible sense. And I am leaving you. This is day 4 sober. I’m never going back to you. NEVER."

I felt good and free to be able to be just normal, talk to people, or just be quiet with no disconfort or awkwardness, just chill. I honestly felt no urge to smoke, or any frustration whatsoever. People were kind of friendly and did not care about me smoking or not, and I did not care about them smoking too. I enjoyed the trip vey much, had a great day, talked to people, got some pretty nice waves, and went back home tired and happy, it felt just great.

Ask yourself if you really want to live your next 5 years like your last 5. Or if you wanna look back and be able to say: ""yea, what I've done the last years actually wasn't a complete mess like before""

All of us needs to accept one thing:
There is a little guy living in all of us, who just wants to chill in bed, smoke and do nothing. The purpose of our life is to fight this guy, no matter what. He is not in charge, you are. And if you're not, show this little fucker how you're going to take back control over your life."

Now when I start to crave it, I tell myself that I could smoke, but I am not going to. It's a really simple change of mindset that is super empowering. Rather than feeling horrible about not being able to get high, I feel proud of myself for choosing not to even when things get tough. I hope this can help some of you on here!

I’m on day 5 again and the weather was perfect. I started thinking about fishing and of-course the triggers came. I said to myself, “weed, you will not hold me back from something I love.” I have been fishing since I can remember, why should this hold me back? Well I went yesterday and had a blast. It kinda sucked on the drive there, but as soon as I started paddling, I totally forgot about wanting to get high. I was actually much more aware of what was going on, more energy, and no stopping for munchies. It was great. Triggers are hard to get over, but if you can, go do what you want and make new memories.

My biggest fear in life is that I wont be competent enough to preform my responsibilities in life. The idea that you can do everything you can do sober just as well high is a lie. It’s been degrading my work for too long and it’s time to stop. 

When you’re high or have recently been high, your ability to search for answers and make decisions is fucked. You will not give a clear of an answer to a question. You will not make as good of a decision as if you were sober.  You make life decisions and investments that are clouded every time you act under intoxication instead of clarity. 

If you weren’t high, you’d think clearer, make more rational decisions, speak clearer to people so that they would know how intelligent you actually are. Instead you’ve decided that intelligence is inherent and doesn’t need to be nurtured. Rather than building upon ideas by reading relevant literature, building relationships with people of similar interests or exploring your amazing personality. You instead hide yourself in an emotionless state spending your time, energy and motivation to avoid the emotional roller coaster that is sobriety. 

Show people that there is more too you than a silent figure who passes in and out of interactions. Stop being excited to go home to a bag of funk. Stop running away from being in a state of mind that people will learn to love you for. 

There is no originality in smoking cannabis, only repetition. Don’t be the same thing you were yesterday, its getting boring. "

I’ve realised I have a lot of guilt when it comes to smoking weed. I thought that quitting should mean that I won’t ever smoke again, and I won’t even want to. I have felt so guilty the last few days every time I wanted a joint in my hand. 

Today I’ve realised it’s okay to want to smoke. It’s okay to crave something you’ve become so used to having and then suddenly disappears from your life. That’s normal. People crave or miss weed, drugs, coffee, junk food, parties, a holiday, a special someone, a pet... Anything. Just because you want it doesn’t mean that’s wrong, or that it is still controlling you. 

Cravings are okay to have. There is no reason to feel guilty. It’s how you act in response to them that matters.

I was smoking before work, during work, after work and until I passed tf out. This went on for two years. Before that cycle, I was an everyday smoker for 4 years in college. So that’s just a bit of a background. Today is the end of 65 days. This has been a really special week for me because I started running 3 miles everyday. I can already see an improvement. This has also been a special week because I’ve come to the realization that although I’ve been quitting a bunch of shit that’s not good for me over the past few years such as caffeine, alcohol, porn, I’ve failed to quit a subtle addiction that was holding me back. This is the internet. I never realized until recently how addicted I was. I wouldn’t really spend any time on YouTube or social media accounts but I would spend time here on reddit interacting with people I don’t even know. And it’s alright at first. Especially if the interaction is for your own personal development. I realized that soon I became dependent on certain type of posts that would give me a quick bit of dopamine. The search for good content is similar to the search for a good porn video. It’s crazy. Idk if I’m just super aware of it now that I’m clean, but I feel the release of dopamine whenever I see a good or funny post. Today I was at lunch and I noticed everyone was on there phone, scrolling through Instagram feeds, but they were still trying to have a convo. As in they’re giving their brains little bits of dopamine to feel good while having that conversation. I’ve also realized that whenever I would get home from work, I’d go straight to my room and read a bunch of posts and talk to people around the world and completely ignore the people who are actually in my life and who actually matter like my family. But it all seems good right? You’re working on yourself and it’s okay to be all caught up in your phone because it’s for your own good. No. There is something seriously wrong and twisted with how consumed we are by our devices and how much we neglect real life interactions for a quick bit of dopamine from a stupid post. I’m typing this to you because I feel like even though we quit weed, we’re still releasing dopamine through other outlets even the most subtle ones. People who were born when the internet came out and were unlucky not only battled a porn addiction but an addiction to wanting quick information. We’ve all been fucked up. I’m typing this now because I want to wish you all good luck in your journey. I won’t be on here anymore for a really long time. I’m done with these distractions in life.

I started a new account as my other username is identifiable, so excuse my lack of karma/age.

I started smoking my sophomore year in college as part of a work hard - play hard mentality. I was in a tough major and would smoke after a long day of class and studying. I had goals firmly in mind and smoking never got in the way. 

Then at 22 I met my now husband, a daily user who was a totally functional stoner...and soon I was smoking during the day too, but still only if I had nothing else going on (class, etc.) Thus continued our relationship with each other and weed...through grad school (me) and entrepreneurship (him). 

Fast forward 14 years and we have 2 happy, healthy young kids, very successful careers, a nice house in the suburbs, etc. The picture of a perfect life despite continued daily use for us both. He still smokes more than I do as he can work stoned and I definitely cannot, but I would smoke after I got home from work and again before bed. I'm not much of a drinker so I considered smoking weed my equivalent of a ""glass of wine"" since that is so much more culturally acceptable. I didn't advertise my use to anyone. A few of our close friends knew I smoked occasionally, but none knew how much I really used.

I have felt guilty about smoking so much weed since having our first kid, and especially as she has gotten older and takes notice when we disappear into the garage for a few minutes. That being said, weed became legal in our state so it was easy to get, we had money for it and wasn't affecting our careers...so why stop? 

Well, 8 days ago we went on a family vacation to a state where we couldn't legally obtain any ganga and on day 3 I had severe anxiety. I have a history of depression/anxiety but suspected it was withdrawals...and when I realized my headaches and night sweats were likely symptoms too, I felt embarrassed. Embarrassed that a grown ass woman, a mom, a professional, was withdrawing from a drug she was addicted to.

I made the decision then and there to quit completely. My husband was reasonably stunned and worried that I would ""make"" him quit too, which I have no intention of doing - this is for me and me alone. Plus, I could stand to go without the nightly stoner carb binges! 

So last night was our first normal night at home after vacay and after we put the kids to bed, my first real craving hit (we always smoke together after they go to bed). Instead, my husband went out to the garage alone and afterwards we settled in together to watch our shows and snuggle and it was actually really enjoyable. I only ate 2 oreos as a bedtime snack (a feat of control not possible while high) and here I am on day 8...feeling happier, less ashamed, more clear-headed and with more desire to socialize than I have felt in years. AND 3lbs down!

I know this is the right path for me, and I am so thankful to this community as it has already given me so much strength and motivation. I can't tell really anyone in my life of my success because they never knew of my addiction, so thanks for listening, friends."

Being sober offers a high of its own,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gaf7ww/being_sober_offers_a_high_of_its_own/,2020-04-29 22:56:02,"I’m only a week and a half in, so feel free to take what I say with a grain of salt. 

Today I felt something real, something palpable that I haven’t felt in years. It was like my body and mind were operating at peak efficiency and in perfect sync with one another. 

Woke up early (my sleep schedule is already 10x better than it was before I quit. Sleep from 12-9 or so instead of 4-1, but that’s beside the point), ate breakfast, and ran a few miles. That’s when I noticed how unbelievable I felt, both physically and mentally.

It was a feeling that had never been accomplished through chasing fleeting body highs. I felt for the first time in a long time that I was on the right track in life, offering a sense of accomplishment and a complete lack of guilt over my life choices, past and present. It embodied a feeling of almost child-like wonder, an overwhelming rush that made me just want to dance and celebrate, not giving a fuck about who was looking at me randomly exploding during a mid-day run. At first, I didn’t even know what to do with myself because I had no idea what was happening. But I’m here for all of it.

I think this is the way, ladies and gents"

I shan't lie and say my cravings are gone completely - I started walking a lot around reservoirs and forests to get me active and out of the house, in an attempt to alleviate my cravings - when I get to a picturesque location, I still immediately think 'this would be a good place to roll up', but that is also getting less and less.

I don't need weed to appreciate the beauty of life - if anything, I've realised that weed has made me apathetic to life and reduced my ability to appreciate what is around us.

The lies we tell ourselves regarding moderation,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gdiqee/the_lies_we_tell_ourselves_regarding_moderation/,2020-05-04 23:51:44,"As a long time lurker, I've felt such comfort in this sub when reading posts that relay the same feelings I've always held about my weed use and desire to quit. As such, I wanted to share some thoughts I had regarding moderation, and how I've always tried to quit with strings attached. 

I'm 27 now, but I first began smoking heavily around 21 while in college. Throughout college and grad school, I was better than my other friends at putting the weed away before finals, and that gave me a false sense of control over weed and my desire to always be high. In my mid-20s I began to notice the negative effects around smoking that we all know (ex. lack of motivation, complacency, lethargy, etc.), but my life was ""on track"", and on paper everything looked perfect, so I kept telling myself moderation was all I needed to achieve. 

I think I've considered and tried every level of moderation that exists, but each comes with its own awful effects: 

- **I'll only smoke on weekends!** (Which makes that feeling of ""living for the weekend"" so much worse, and makes the weekend fly by too fast while the week drags on). 

- **I'll only smoke on weekdays!** (The idea being that weekdays already suck, so might as well smoke to ease the stress of work, but all this does is make you dread every second of the workday even more so you can finally log-off, and having your weekend feel duller as you don't have weed to enjoy it)
- **I'll only smoke at night!** (Makes you sleep-in and ruins your mornings, and you don't want to get out of bed as every second of the day that goes by gets you closer to nighttime where you can finally smoke and relax)
- **I'll only smoke when my friends offer it to me!** (This makes you seek out your friends for the goal of getting high, or asking your friend for a nug to take home as you had such a fun time smoking with them)

 -**I'll only smoke on 4/20, or my birthday, or on vacation, or ...** (the ""special days"" that you can smoke began to add up, and you realize you always have weed leftover, so might as well smoke it all until it's done...)

- **I'll quit for a week/month/few months**  (This is my most common method. I gear up for one last big smoke sesh, and then proudly tell others I'm taking a break. ""See, I have it under control, I can quit for a week/month, so it's clearly not an issue."" But the deadline always makes you just count down the days until you can go back to being ""happy"". Every positive that comes with not smoking gets hampered by the fact that you know you're just waiting around to get back to it. How can you admit that you feel so much better, healthier, cleaner, energetic, etc. when you also know you are going to reintroduce weed back into your life? What ends up happening is you dive right back in, sometimes even deeper, and the cycle begins anew.)

Even now, telling myself that I need to quit forever is tough. Like so many of you, weed has opened my mind and given me so many positive experiences. But I know that my relationship with weed is now a toxic one that only keeps me emotionally and physically stunted as the years march on. And I know now that my dreams of smoking in moderation are just ways to make sure I never truly have to grow and deal with the underlying issues of my addiction. 

Weed is nefarious in that others don't clearly see the issues of your use, but it slowly chips away at your spirit. Your eyes lose a light that you know was once there. Typing this out has helped me understand that what I really need is to quit wholeheartedly. I'm so thankful that this sub exists and I hope this post can help someone as so many posts have helped me.

EDIT: With all this said, I do believe moderation has helped me throughout my life, and I'm certain others are able to moderate their use and find a healthy middle-ground in their relationship with weed. I just know personally that I use moderation as a crutch, and have slowly come to the realization that I must give up weed for a long period of time before I even consider reintroducing it into my life."

Whenever the narrator in these videos talks about how to foster growth and well-being, I realize how much my habit messes with this stuff. Variation of stimuli? Many of us are content to watch and do the exact same things over and over when we are high. Regular daily schedule? Sometimes I would stay up until four in the morning while smoking, sometimes I would go to bed at five o'clock because I was exhausted from being up all night. Reciprocal interaction? Nah, I'd rather be alone and think the same things I always have. I don't know if weed made me any dumber, but I sure as hell know it wasn't making me smarter. I've thought these kinds of things before, but something about watching babies say their first words after months of producing incoherent babblespeak woke me up."

Hi my name is Ray and I'm an Addict,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/betpup/hi_my_name_is_ray_and_im_an_addict/,2019-04-19 05:50:04,"Hi everyone I've wanted to post this for awhile. I want to do 3 things with this post, demystify the presumptions of marijuana addiction, tell my story about being in recovery, and allow anyone who has questions about sobriety to reach out.

I just past 1 year of sobriety, after 8 years of daily smoking from the age of 18 to 26. I lived a life of being a complete slave to marijuana. I needed it to eat. I needed it to sleep. I needed it to hang out with friends. I needed it like my body needs water.

I didn't really know anything else. This just seemed normal. 

Then one day my girlfriend of 5 years gave me an ultimatum. Either quit smoking weed or she's leaving. 

This hit me hard. I didn't want to lose pot. Pot was my medicine.... But I also didn't want to lose the love of my life. I knew pot was a problem .... But society told me it wasn't addictive. So what the hell do I do...

It took some time but I finally mustered up the courage to call a local therapist. Fucking expensive but it was something I had to do.

I went, and hated it. I hated admitting I had a problem, I hated pretending like I wanted to quit. In reality I wanted her to wave a magic wand to take away my addiction so I could just smoke weed on weekends or something.

This is not how recovery works.

I kept going back because I had to. Until one day she handed me a booklet called ""core beliefs"". This is what changed everything for me....

I learned addiction is not actually the problem... It's the solution. The actual problem are my negative core beliefs about myself and character defects that *cause* me to be an addict.

This hit me hard. 

For me, my defects of character are low self esteem. I built an ego to protect myself from dealing with my insecurities (a common defect). I was a chronic perfectionist, nothing was ever good enough. Another sign of insecurity.

I grew up with big dreams and aspirations, but never lived up to them. This taught me it was these very character defects that caused me to never succeed (or even try), and in order to deal with that stress/pressure I would use. My addiction was the solution. A terrible solution.

It still took me a few weeks to finally say goodbye... Because I knew I had to say goodbye forever. 

Once I finally quit for a day, i attended my first Marijuana Anonymous meeting. I really hated it. To have to sit in a room and admit my problem? Fuck that. I collected my welcome chip anyway, and the second the meeting ended I tried to get out. But a gentleman by the name of Amin stopped me and asked how I was doing.

I told him the truth that i didn't want to do this but I had to... That I was scared. 

He said ""You know Ray, of all the 12 steps, only the first step actually talks about marijuana""

This helped. It made me realize even more that recovery was about working on myself, and not on my addiction.

Still, my addict brain was strong. I went back to my therapist and told her I hated MA and thought it was stupid"".

She said ""you're right Ray. It is stupid.

And it works""

So I kept coming back.

I went through the physical bullshit... No eating, no sleeping, irritability, night sweats. (Skip to the bottom of this post for tricks to get through this.)


I heard stories of people who actually told me sobriety was BETTER than using. At the time, I thought they were full of shit... but I had to trust them... I had to to keep that motivation. 

After a couple weeks I started slowly feeling a bit better. I started coming around to the meetings and actually begun to share . Sometimes. Lol.

As time went on I kept doing the work. I went through the steps with my therapist. A painful experience. But i worked the program.

In took about a month to start noticing changes in my behaviour. 

I kept going back to meetings. I started actually enjoying the meetings. Being around a bunch of people going through the same bullshit as me.... With a drug that society laughs at you for having an addiction with.... It was the only place I could be completely honest.

Fast forward 12 months.

Here I am. 1 year sober and I notice my character defects going away. I'm not worried what people think of me, I do what I want and say what I want without that voice telling me whatever bullshit. I've started building my dream this past week. A blog about my passions. Something I would NEVER do as an insecure addict. I can live a life of total freedom now.

I can totally and honestly say sobriety is WAY FUCKING BETTER than using.

If you only take away one thing from this post make it this.... *Recovery gives you everything weed promised.*

I now go to multiple meetings a week. Because I want to. I host an MA meeting at a rehab centre as well. Helping inpatient addicts weekly. Holy fucking rewarding that is.

To tell you what I've lost since the day I quit weed:
- I lost my job
- I lost my condo (my favourite location of all time)
- I lost my girlfriend (after 5 Months of sobriety we actually decided to mutually end the 5 year relationship)
- I lost my business I had started
- my dog died

And I can 100% honestly say I would trade all of those losts TEN FOLD for the emotional wellbeing I get to experience today. I'm doing things here at 27 I never thought I'd be able to do. Living in peace with myself. Enjoying life.

I still have a lot to work on. But holy shit the amount of change in myself I've done in a year.... I never thought I could get here and yet only a year later and I'm doing things I never thought I could do. 

Somebody passed me a joint at a party couple weekends ago and it made me laugh... why the fuck would I smoke this... The emotional rewards are worth WAY more than this joint. And yet one year ago I was smoking 3.5 grams of this shit a day.

This freedom... It's worth it. I'm no longer a slave to marijuana. But most importantly, I'm no longer a slave to my brain.

Thank you for letting me be of service. 

Please, if you have ANY questions about recovery/sobriety/MA, please ask me anything. I'm an open book.

Bonus:
Marijuana anonymous: http://marijuana-anonymous.org (HIGHLY RECOMMEND A RECOVERY PROGRAM. A SOBER ADDICT WITHOUT A PROGRAM IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN)

If there's no MA in your town go to Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or AA meetings . Pretty much the same structure.

You can also download the FREE MA app with all readings, step work etc. Available on app store.

Cold turkey or weaning: 
There's no such thing for an addict as weaning off weed. You're an addict. Weaning off isn't fixing anything. When I first quit weed I had to quit every mind altering substance (alcohol). Because I lost these dopamine rushes.... I had the most sex I've ever had in my life.... I ate fast food daily, cookies, candy... Because I'm an addict and I need that rush. In order to truly fix the addiction, cold turkey is the only solution.

How to deal with physical symptoms: (for me they lasted about 2 weeks)....

Sleep - wooooorkouttttt. Sweat it out like crazy. This will also help with food. Also go to the pharmacy and purchase Melatonin. Its the natural chemical in your brain that tells your body to go to sleep. It stops working when you smoke so much dope.

Food - smoothies. I couldn't get anything down.... Was never hungry. Make smoothies because not eating is very unhealthy

Night sweats - extra sheets. Necessary evil for me... The more sweats the better the dreams in a couple weeks

Cravings - every time you resist a craving... The cravings power lessons. 

Irritability - move your body. And don't trust ANY emotion for the first few weeks. Your body is trying to fight you to get it's fix.. he/she is NOT happy.

How to actually quit. - give yourself enough of a reason.... A purpose for quitting. I experienced enough pain from my character defects controlling me that motivation to fix them is very strong.
WRITE THIS MOTIVATION DOWN. Your brain is going to try and trick you into using.

I've met people that went homeless, psychotic, handcuffed to hospital beds, living off park benches, all from weed.

This is not the same drug as your parents smoked.

The addiction components of this drug are seriously real. Do NOT let anyone tell you otherwise...."

Today I feel so much better. I have the motivation to improve myself in so many other ways, and putting in effort for a better future. I no longer hate myself - I actually kind of like myself - and I think that has made it easier for other people to like me too.

It was hard in the beginning but I am so glad I stuck with it. I feel like a new person and I was desperate to be where I am now. If you are struggling please hang in there. It gets easier and its so worth it."
Pot is addictive,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ct2vy0/pot_is_addictive/,2019-08-20 21:42:22,"I was one of those stoners who believed that you couldn't get addicted to pot. It's non-addictive! Wrong. My brain makes up reasons to smoke = Addiction. I don't feel like I can get anything done until I smoke = Addiction. You can't overdose! Wrong. I overdose every day, it just doesn't kill me. My body doesn't feel as many physical effects from it now because I smoke so much = Overdose. But it does kill my motivation and my drive to be a better person. I live the same exact day every day because of pot. Yes it may not be as bad as harder drugs or alcohol, but I am not living a good life this way. It is covering up everything I need to deal with mentally and emotionally and is the reason I haven't progressed as far in life as I had wanted. I've tried to quit in the past, but never under the guise of an addict. I realized that if I swapped a bowl with a shot, I would be hammered by noon. If this isn't addiction, then I don't know what is. My therapist recommended I try AA meetings or something similar. I just get so annoyed now when I hear people say that it isn't addictive. I used to be one of those people, but I think that was what helped me think it was okay to smoke every day.  That's what makes it so dangerous. Thank you for whoever listens to this rant. I just am having difficulty getting to the next step of actually quitting."
"Just wanted to shout-out how incredible this whole sub is. I just messed up my day 1 after only an hour of waking up, but coming back here and checking this sub reminds me there is still hope. I will get there, things are just hard...",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hbekxw/just_wanted_to_shoutout_how_incredible_this_whole/,2020-06-18 17:28:06,"I have been lurking this sub for a long time on and off over the years. Weed has been steady in my life since I was 15 and I am now 26. I have been a daily smoker for at least the past few years now, time is so blurred together it is hard to keep track. In the past year I made the realization marijuana is holding me back but every time I try to quit I end up reverting back to it. 

The past few months have been hell for me for a lot of reasons, but the past couple of weeks I went off of my antidepressants cold-turkey and have been in severe physical and mental withdrawal. I used weed to help cope as usual and it honestly made me feel worse - more nauseous, more angry. And I decided once I got my meds back again (which I did last night) That I would stop smoking weed for good, or at least for a while. I decided I need to stop neglecting my medication and mental health for a life of getting high to numb the pain, even though it has comforted me so much it has taken over my life and kept me stuck for too long. So this morning, back on my meds and motivated and finally not feeling sick to my stomach, I decided I was going to start today. 

It's only 920 and I already fucked that up. I just was so bored and laying here not motivated and just could not stop thinking about how if I just take a hit it would help even it out. So I packed a bowl and did just that, because for some reason my self control is that of a 5 year old. Trying not to hate on myself right now, so I went back to this sub to read everyone's words of wisdom instead. 

Reading all the posts on the front page of leaves instead of dwelling in my fuck up is making me feel better. I am still disappointed that I did this, but I know it is not a linear battle and I have given up vices before - weed just time and time again has proven to be the hardest one for me to let go of. I tend to give up and beat myself up when I make mistakes like this and then throw the whole thing away altogether, but no. I am not going to let this one hit ruin what could be a good rest of day 1. I am determined and I have seen how strong all of you are and how far all of you have come - if all of these people can do it, who says I can't too? The support and positive vibes around here is incredible. I want to be free of this addiction so I can feel that too. 

Sorry for the rant, but I guess what I am trying to say thanks all of you for reminding me that I got this and allowing me to not let one impulsive bong hit turn into a full day of binge smoking. Now I am putting the bong away and going to do a barre workout so I can get some natural endorphins and restart my day off right :) Hope you all have a fantastic day!"
"Inspired by 150 days clean post I checked my sobriety counter, 273 days clean. Here’s my story of how my extreme abuse of dabs *actually* almost killed me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fodk2j/inspired_by_150_days_clean_post_i_checked_my/,2020-03-25 01:26:07,"It’s a very long and complicated story but I was addicted to weed. I smoked 30+ dabs a day from my dab pen, live in a state where it’s plentiful and cheap. It triggered something called marijuana induced hyperemesis that caused me to throw up uncontrollably for so long o had to go to the emergency room 6+ times in two years for fluids and weapons grade anti nausea medicine. This in addition to 5 hot yoga classes a week weakened my heart and I didn’t know it. 


Vomiting and dabs can have a negative effect on your heart and so I went in for a short surgical procedure to have a lip cyst removed and the anesthesia stressed my heart to the point that it malformed (called broken heart dz) and triggered a domino effect of organ failure. I was in a coma for ten days and the shock caused my right leg to die from lack of blood supply. I was on dialysis, a heart and kidney transplant list, on a heart/lung bypass machine called an ECMO that oxygenated and warmed my blood for me. I didn’t end up needing a transplant but I did become an amputee at 23. I did suffer actual withdrawals from dabs, in that I couldn’t keep any food down the entire month I was in the hospital and I lost a lot of weight. 


I’m 25 now, I recorded a podcast episode for This is Actually Happening episode 135 with the full story if anyone is interested. But when I tell my story now I get hate by people telling me I’m lying and shit. It’s not that weed in itself is harmful, but I’m an addict and I can abuse anything to the point of harming myself. And I did. After I stopped smoking I became an alcoholic for a short period of time before I finally hit rock bottom and gave up booze too. So.. here I am 273 days sober. I miss it sometimes but I remind myself that I am incapable of using it responsibly and so I’ve lost the privilege. If you have any questions about my sobriety or the amputation feel free to ask."

365 days clean :),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/abguq1/365_days_clean/,2019-01-01 12:17:58,"I did it! i made it one whole year without consuming cannabis. I’ve set a New Years resolution every year for the past few years: writing in a journal every night, no meat, no soda, and this year no weed.  Because I’ve successfully done other resolutions, I knew I could do it. But this one was harder than the others for sure; especially because I didn’t consume meat or soda every day, and the journaling was a new habit. 

After about two months, I began to dream again (remember them the next morning, at least). Also began feeling emotions again– no more being a zombie, dragging his feet along in life.  I’ve felt happiness again, as opposed to just joy from having some laughs, kickin back, and smoking a joint with the homies

I’ve saved quite a bit of money, no exact dollar amount but I know there is an app out there (that I definitely plan on downloading this next year) that tells you how much money you’ve saved from not buying bags every week.

If you’re interested in giving it a try, I say start tonight at the start of the new year. Take it one month at a time!  Don’t set out thinking, “I’m gonna go a full year without this!”  Just think, “I’m gonna go a full month without this!”
If you think it’ll help, reward yourself at the end of each month: buy yourself something nice with the money you would’ve spent on bags but instead you saved (congrats!). Or if you really must, smoke a bowl :)
Or if you‘s rather, plan 3 or 6 months in advance with a bigger reward: a trip somewhere, a new computer, a new upgrade for your car/house, etc. 

I’ve been living a HAPPIER life without weed. For a while I considered smoking on January 1st, at least to see if I’d still like it, but I’ve lost interest in smoking. I can still appreciate the plant however. When friends smoke, I no longer have the urge to join them, but instead admire and appreciate it without partaking. Please feel free to PM me if you ever need some kind of encouragement or whatever :)"

While replying to your messages and comments, I realized that I wanted to share my side because I feel like this addiction and sub needs the focus on positivity to keep going. Don’t count days, focus on what you lose but what you gain. 

I shared my post with my (not smoker) BF. He admitted that it’s been depressing seeing me stoned, dumbed down and pointless. I’m a different person since stopping and it’s been a realization for me to admit that it’s not just myself that notices the changes. 

Keep adding to the list, keep embracing your journey and keep supporting quiet lurkers! Thank you so so much for all of you, you are all amazing!

—————-original post—————

Dear leavers, I’m a loooong time lurker. Been clean for about 8 months now, but I have not been counting the days, can’t really even remember my last joint. Kicked the habit after 7 years of daily use.
The last months of smoking were just full of self loathing, smoking miserably while reading your posts and deciding every time that I’ll quit after this one. After long build up, I succeeded. Since then, I tried not giving too much importance to smoking in my head and been appreciating all the little things that I can do/enjoy now in my every days. Hopefully it inspires some of you, just like you motivated me. I tried collecting some things that I don’t see that often in this sub, I think you are all so great with expressing the main learnings, ups and downs of what we are going through. 

So here it goes:

- being able to answer calls, receive guests, visit friends/neighbors with last minute notice. No need to plan my social life around being high.
- open my doors with pride. I used to be paranoid about the smell for anyone coming to visit or stay-over guests finding my stash accidentally. Especially paranoid with family, the thought of my mom finding my stash gave me panic attacks.
- get lost in the house holding chores and other activities that I used to always get high before. I’d smoke before folding laundry or doing a batch of dishes (if even doing it), just to break the monotony. Now I listen to podcasts, audiobooks, zone out and I’m happy about it.
- spontaneously get on my bike, go for a walk, leave the house to enjoy the weather or something I’m listening to AND do it any time!— not dreading leaving the house, not planning days around when I’ll be a couch potato.
- planning and making healthy meals, weekly mealplans- I didn’t have the energy and couldn’t keep coherent enough thoughts, focus and memory to plan.
- planning anything in general. Trips, next projects, calendar, home improvements...- having focus+memory combo back is priceless
- brushing teeth, caring for personal hygiene, even enjoying it
- starting and finishing projects, hobbies around the house - I learned to sew, plant veggies, upholster.. all things I’ve been putting out while high
- no ashes, no stashes, no stench, no fear of neighbors, police
- enjoying one-on-one conversations, getting deep in somebody’s story, friend or stranger - I’m not scared of people anymore and gained my interest back in others
- not caring what people think - weed used to make me paranoid just walking down the street. I used to think everybody is staring at me, judging and I had a sad narration of what they must be thinking about me.
- not thinking of myself as an addict or as a functioning person with a secret “hobby” - I’m more forward with who I am, open up to people more easily, proud of what I achieved as a person - for what I do, not despite what I do 

Thank you for everything for this community! I’m going back to lurking."

"19 years old, my story, and how my best friend‘s weed habit ultimately resulted in schizophrenia. Please read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g45v49/19_years_old_my_story_and_how_my_best_friends/,2020-04-19 15:00:34,"I am two weeks sober. I’m relatively young dude (19 years old) compared to many on here. I was dependent on weed for two years. I tried to quit the herb many times, but I truly believe this time is different.

Let me tell you my story.

My post history on reddit is a firsthand example of the mental toll this drug has taken on me over the last two years. I went from a motivated, high achieving student religiously posting on college subreddits to a complete stoner (and anxious wreck) warning those on /r/oilpen about fake carts. Like many of you, I told myself the lie I was capable of being a “high-functioning” stoner. In reality, I became a “barely-functioning” addict.

Coming out of high school, I was accepted to a top twenty university on a full scholarship. I decided to take it easy senior year, which is when I let myself go & became a complete weed fiend. I absolutely loved weed at first, somehow way more than most. I told myself I would quit when I went to to college.

I distinctly remember meeting my roommate (now one of my best friends) freshman year of college. Let’s call him P. When I first met him, I remember trying to feel P out & contemplating whether or not I should tell him about my habit. Both of us quite shy, I decided to ask him if he had smoked weed in high school. He responded with a resounding “Yes!” and that he had been fiending since senior year as well. Ten minutes later, we both whipped out our dab pens & the rest was history. We smoked every single day to the point where it became a ritual. We figured that we were young & that we should live it up our freshman year. I was soon FULLY dependent marijuana (specifically wax) and was getting high all day everyday. This went on for nearly 2 years.

Fast forward to first semester sophomore year (last semester), P and I were still toking it up like crazy with only vague intentions to stop. All of the sudden, at the beginning of last semester, P became quiet, sleepy, and more unmotivated than usual. Something was off, and I assumed it was depression at first. I made the huge mistake of continuing to enable P by smoking in our dorm room and he never truly ended up quitting despite his intentions.

This last semester, not a whole lot changed regarding our pot use. We kept smoking and smoking, but this time we managed to taper down & stick to just flower. P, however, was still acting off when he wasn’t high and I decided to finally confront him about it. He revealed to me that had been hearing voices for the past year. These voices were preventing from concentrating in school & confining him to his bed all day. Upon hearing this, I broke down. It all made sense. When we were high, so many times had P told me superstitious shit & how he was “communicating with God”. I would just tell him that he was high as fuck and just trippin’ & we’d just laugh it off. Little did I know that P was literally HEARING a discourse between God and the Devil in his mind. When he broke the news that he was hearing voices & these voices were perpetually throwing him into a debilitated state, I realized he likely had schizophrenia. Upon this realization, I tearfully asked P, “What if you hadn’t smoked weed to begin with? You think things would be different?” He revealed to me that ever since he smoked marijuana in high school, something was “off” in his mind and he couldn’t quite point his finger on it. As he continued to smoke like crazy alongside me, his condition worsened to what it is today.

I’m not suggesting that marijuana is the culprit for psychosis & schizophrenia. I do know though that it can bring out these conditions in those that are at risk of developing them (like P was, even though he had no idea). I was affected by the plant differently. Persistent, hourly exposure to very high THC levels led to severe anxiety to the point where it was debilitating, triggering multiple mental breakdowns throughout freshman year. I somehow continued to smoke to quell this anxiety, which became a vicious cycle and exacerbated it in the long run. No matter how much I wanted to smoke in moderation, I just couldn’t do it because I was fully addicted.

P and I are still very close friends & have gone back home because of this corona shit. P, who stills hears voices everyday, has been sober for over a month. I’ve been sober for two weeks. We are supporting each other in this journey and I aspire to one day attend medical school & specialize in psychiatry so I can help P and those suffering from similar conditions. As an addict myself, I have taken an interest in studying addictions and also intend to go into addiction psychiatry.

These past two weeks, I have gotten intense cravings & thought of kickin’ it and smoking a joint is so enticing. However, I have taken comfort in knowing that my anxiety has vanished. The mental clarity is phenomenal. I have aced all of my exams this past week, something I’ve never done during my time in college. I feel so much more confident in my abilities. I also have an extremely supportive girlfriend (who I love deeply) that tells me everyday I made the correct decision.

Whenever I get the urge to smoke, I just think about all the negative shit this plant has caused all of us. It has blunted us, made us perpetually  lazy, and has sapped us of our intrinsic human motivation to better ourselves. It ultimately destroyed my best friend.

I’m never going back and this post can hold me accountable.

\[Edit\] Let me make something clear guys. I am not staying weed was the CAUSE of P's schizophrenia. According to the scientific literature, the cause is likely attributed to an underlying genetic abnormality and/or environmental factors such as exposure to teratogens. All I'm saying is that marijuana certainly exacerbated his condition and served as a pivotal trigger. Upon smoking for the first time, P reported he had never felt the same and that something was off, even if hadn't developed the condition right off the bat. It may have been entirely possible he would have developed the condition anyway if he hadn't smoked weed but my gut tells me otherwise.

\[Edit\] Thanks for the silver & gold. Here's to a life of purpose, confidence, and NEVER giving in!"

Day 3000: A life changing decision,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cnjhsd/day_3000_a_life_changing_decision/,2019-08-08 13:50:35,"This month marks my 3000th day in a row as a non-smoker. 8 years ago, I had smoked cannabis for more than 10 years just about every single day, from my teens to my twenties. Im now in my thirties. 

Back then, I had some breaks lasting weeks now and then, but never managed to kick the habit completely. In fact, towards the later years of my smoking career, I was in a cycle of quitting and relapsing. I had A LOT of first days of quitting. Like hundreds. I had many times where I would get through the hardest early weeks of restlesness, sweaty nights, mood swings and general discomfort, and then relapse when I started to return to a normal state. Returning to baseline somehow seemed to lower my guard and I began forget why I wanted to quit in the first place, and would talk myself into smoking again.

The last time I smoked I had been on a vacation in a foreign country where I was abstinent for 3 weeks. I came home and relapsed the first weekend while drunk, I felt like shit and decided to quit again. This time I joined a gym monday and started working out seriously. I had always kept in decent shape, but now I finally decided to make it a central focus of my life. With that decision, I had found what needed to replace my weed addiction. I was a compulsive smoker, now I could use the same habit driven determination to become a better athlete. Once I got going it felt so nice, and once I started noticing improvements in my life, I then knew that returning to the old ways of smoking ment I would lose it all. And that deterred me from relapsing. But I had to get the ball rolling. My many past experiences of relapsing also helped me predict vulnerable situations I could then prevent, by making the right decision preemptively instead of being impulsive and relapsing.

Finding new dimensions of my identity was the hardest. I had to figure out who I was as an adult without weed, a companion that had followed me through my developing years into adulthood. Weed is like your best friend you always know where you have. It was linked to almost all aspects of my life: Who I was, where I went and what I did. Letting go of that relationship and moving forward into new territory feels uncomfortable. But in order to grow as a person, old ways sometimes need to die. Speaking of friends, almost all my friends smoked. Since most were good friends, and still are today, I needed to become a no-man when it came to getting high together. Saying ""no thanks"" is hard, but really powerful. This also inspired some friends to quit themselves. Some still smoke today on their 15-20th year, but some have quit. Guess who have matured the most?

Looking back now, man have I grown. Since kicking the habit, I now have a college degree, a loving family, and I am in the best shape of my life, physically and mentally. The memory and foggy mind cleared up. The depression and anhedonia have improved considerably. The anxiety is gone. I sleep well. Of course I still have ups and downs like everyone else, but everything became much easier. I'm positive I would not have the same quality of life today, if I had kept on smoking.

The addiction is like malware in your operating system. It creates pop-up spam with cravings and smoking ideas. The pop ups are sometimes random, but are usually triggered by stimuli that are associated with the feeling of getting high, such as after eating, before sleeping, being with friends, watching a movie, etc. Even negative emotions works as triggers if you are used to smoking when you feel sad. The good news is that as time without smoking passes, the pop ups fade. In the beginning I would think about smoking many times a day, even many times an hour. Then it was a few times a week. Then a few times a month. Now the thought may cross my mind rarely, but it's more of a nostalgic memory than a real desire to smoke. So if you are struggling with repeated thoughts about smoking, give your mind time to let go of the old habits, and remember that you are not your thoughts.

This post is becoming long, but I wanted to tell my story and I hope it will inspire you to quit for good. Cannabis wont kill you, but it will prevent you from reaching your potential. I don't know about you, but I want to make the most of my life. I know that wont happen if I sit on my couch being high, dreaming about what I could have done.

Some tips:

1 - Find a hobby you can invest your time and energy into that brings you growth and happiness: Learn to play the piano. Learn a martial art. Paint. Run. Read books. Lift weights. Go fishing. Pick up something that you used to do, but forgot about, or try something new. Join a community where (*insert hobby) is the focus. Do whatever you like, just do something else than smoke, it will help filling the void. If you pick a social hobby that's a great way to meet people that you can hang around with where smoking is not the focus.

2 - Exercise. It improves sleep, depression and helps you feel better. It gives you goals you can focus on with your newfound spare time. Tip 1 and 2 can be combined. That's what I did.

3 - Involve your close ones in your decision. They can help you when you are feeling down. They can better cope with your mood swings if they know the reason behind. You will feel responsible for sticking with the decision, to not let them down.

4 - If you relapse, take it as a learning experience and don't be too hard on yourself. Yes you will feel guilt, but try to make the most of it. Figure out what went wrong. Was it the physical discomfort? Was it social pressure? Was it restlessness and boredom? Was it because of a bad day? How did you feel? Who were you with? Use the insights to make smarter decisions going forward.

Feel free to ask me questions.

TLDR; I quit after more than a decade of daily cannabis smoking. My life quality has since improved a lot. You can do it too."

Many times I've doubted myself this last half a year but never completely. Somehow I've always talked myself out of giving in.

Life ain't roses but it sure smells better sober. Feels better sober.

Whatever is next I'm ready for. Can't give up now, my future happiness depends on it.

Funny how time changes you,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ay3nul/funny_how_time_changes_you/,2019-03-06 23:42:09,"I remember during university where smoking weed was this cool lifestyle choice and meant having fun with friends, having some laughs, exploring a new subculture. Then university ends but the party can keep going right? Weed was just an unfairly stereotyped drug with no downsides, if only more people smoked the world would be a better place.

Then the chilling with friends and smoking became smoking a bowl alone and watching some tv or playing video games. Still a great time though right? This was the life! Then slowly your hobbies start dropping away and you find yourself dealing with anxiety when hanging out with friends, sober or high. Then you miss a few important events because you were getting high and it's not a big deal anyway right? People need to chill out.

Then the years and the smoking keep going and you realise that maybe the weed use isn't all good. Maybe the reason you were using it so heavily wasn't because it was so much fun, but because there are some realities you don't want to confront. Maybe the world isn't quite how you imagined it to be, or you aren't the person you thought you were. Then every bowl, every spliff, every vape is just another way of hiding from your own life. Hiding from your ambitions and the chance you might fail, hiding from rejection that would prove you weren't good enough as you always thought.

2 weeks today and no intention of smoking for the rest of 2019. It's time to go outside and face the world."
Fuck weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gbpb9t/fuck_weed/,2020-05-02 00:06:35,"I am on Day 6 after more than 15 years of regular use and several years of heavy daily use.  I have tried and failed to quit dozens of times.  Weed has nearly destroyed my marriage, damaged my relationship with my children, and hampered my career for too long.  Fuck weed.  I am no longer giving it power over me.  I won't let my brain tell me it's fine to smoke ""just once a week"" when I know damn well that it leads back to constant use in just a few weeks... every time.

I am 38 years old, and I'm so much better than the stoner that I've become.  I'm over it.  Disenchanted.  It's not cool.

If you are 15, or 20, or even 30 years old and you smoke more than you'd like, stop now.  Don't cut back.  Don't take a break.  Stop.  If you didn't have a problem, you probably wouldn't be on this sub, and if you think you might have a problem, you probably do.  Every day you allow smoking to become more ingrained into your routine is a day you're getting closer to becoming a life-long stoner who is unable to put anything, including yourself, before getting high.

Some people can do it every once and a while and it's fine.  Some people can even do it once a day or 3 times a week, and they never feel the need to increase their use.  Good for them, but we're not them.  Stop pretending it's fine, because it's not.  The sooner we can realize that it's causing nothing but pain, the sooner we can say ""fuck weed"" and work towards being ourselves again.

Thanks for listening."

The worst thing about having a problem with weed is that literally noone understands it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dwutke/the_worst_thing_about_having_a_problem_with_weed/,2019-11-15 21:31:30,"I've been to two different therapists lately and have mentioned being a marijuana addict. One of them just looked at me blankly and one of them literally said something along the lines of ""well maybe you could just cut back.""

I have a friend for 15 years and he still doesn't get it.

I guess this is how things used to be, and still probably is to a degree, for alcoholics. No one would believe them or tell them they need more willpower or whatever.

I remember posting on imgur a long time ago that I was addicted to marijuana and I literally had fifteen responses that just said ""no you're not."" ""It's not even addicting dude!"" Blah blah blah.

I went to NA recently and feel out of place. never can figure out that chapelle bit ""boo this man!""

Anyway. I'm glad this place exists. Because it's an annoying problem. Like, I'm sure cocaine and heroin are worse addictions, I get it. But if I said ""I'm a cocaine addict trying to stay clean"" that would be fine. people would get that. With weed it's just like no one in the world understands it as a problem."

Why Marijuana Addiction is Bad,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/3e39ik/why_marijuana_addiction_is_bad/,2015-07-21 20:56:56,"Imagine you find yourself living in the jungle, in a strange dome like environment, like you're in the Hunger Games. You don't quite know where you are, or what you're supposed to do, but you are human, so you know you must survive. 

In the distance, a lion approaches. He growls and appears fierce and angry, but he is small enough that you feel you may be able to defeat him. The lion begins sprinting towards you, and you begin sprinting towards it. When you are just feet away from one another, both of you in the air, about to attack one another, a mysterious harness yanks you from the scene of action and away from danger. You're flying, in the clouds, by a string. It's nice and cool, and you are at peace. There is no danger here. You have been saved.

Hours later, you are released, and find yourself on the ground. There is no lion any more, and you are relieved that the mysterious powers have saved you from having to fight the lion.

But a few days later, the lion returns, hungry as usual, and you prepare for combat. You begin to run towards each other, and right as you are about to collide with one another, you are pulled up into the air once again, away from danger.

Time and time again, you are saved from having to fight the lion. Over time, the harness begins to pull you up even before you start sprinting towards the animal. You begin to run less, your fight-or-flight instinct begins to activate less. Due to lack of activity, the muscles in your calves and thighs begin to shrink, realizing they don't need to be so big anymore. 

For five years, you are supported by this magical harness, and are freed from the burden of ever having to fight the lion. But while you lingered in the clouds, light-headed and away from danger and physical work, the lion has gotten bigger, stronger, and hungrier. 

One day, the lion returns, monstrous in size and hunger. He begins to run towards you, but you do not flee, nor do you panic. Because the harness will save you. 

But on this day, the harness does not come.

I had people message me and say ""I caught the smell of a joint today and it reminded me of you, so I thought I'd check in since we haven't spoken for a while.

Someone came up with video game character sprites for my old friend group and I was the one holding a joint.
With those dumb Facebook games of ""what would you include in a summoning circle to summon me?"" It was always weed and rolling supplies. 
I had no personality beyond being high.

I'm 2 months sober today and I've been trying to find my personality.
I am a good cook, a bookworm, dog lover and nature enthusiast. 
I enjoy management games and circus skills, (contact staff, poi and the likes) I am in a D&D campaign and am planning on going larping.
Before the pandemic started I started going to a weekly LGBT club and a juggling club. I was also working up the courage to go to a poetry open mic night. I'm learning French.

I don't want to be ""the stoner"" anymore. I don't want people to expect me to turn up places and get high. I want to be more interesting than that. I want to reclaim the hobbies I lost due to lack of motivation and find more in the process."

The clarity led me to realize I have to leave my partner now. I've been unhappy a long time and trying to cover my misery in a haze of marijuana. We've lived together several years and the splitting is a little complicated. I'm trying to get all my ducks in a row before I announce my decision and go, might be another week or two.
In the meantime the stress and anxiety is hard to bear, while pretending everything is fine.
So I thought 1 little joint yesterday afternoon would be okay to help me through. 
It didn't help, just amplified the anxiety. I still plan to go but am doubting other decisions I've already made about where, when and how to go. I puked 3 times this morning. I feel so overwhelmed.
I threw out the remaining joints I had been keeping in the fridge for some reason.
Wish me luck guys, I need it."

Saw this on my daily walk and it made me laugh. High life was a bit of a one way street for me. No change. No progress. Just years of the same old thing. Glad I’m two months off that road now!,https://i.redd.it/2ohb185r40u11.jpg,2018-10-24 01:17:54,
smoked an ounce a week for the past 2 years straight. 2 weeks sober!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hj65ez/smoked_an_ounce_a_week_for_the_past_2_years/,2020-07-01 12:11:58,"about 2 weeks out and holy shit. i used to use weed as a stress reliever and quickly became addicted because i’m constantly stressed. got to the point of smoking 10+ joints per day, an ounce per week. 

the irony is i’m realizing now weed was also making me insanely depressed, anxious, and paranoid this entire time. i thought those things were part of my identity and weed was helping me. it’s so fucked up the way it warps your perception of yourself and your life. 

2 weeks out i am calm. i am not shaking and sweating and crippled with anxiety. the state of the world is incredibly stressful and yet... i am coping better than i was when i was high. 

also started eating healthy and exercising, i’ve probably lost 10 LBs in that time. i feel amazing. 

i convinced myself marijuana was the only thing keeping me sane. turns out it was the only thing actually making me feel crazy !!"
Ever since I started smoking I stopped reading,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g60yur/ever_since_i_started_smoking_i_stopped_reading/,2020-04-22 17:19:17,"I started smoking regularly in 2018, which quickly turned into a near-daily habit. It was so exciting at the time and every activity on weed felt so fun and novel. It felt like a miracle drug, it eased my social anxiety and helped me be more relaxed and talkative. I was so happy to just get home from work in the evening, put on a chill video game or movie, and spark up.

Fast forward two years, I feel this has had some really bad effects on my life. While I haven't been a constant daily smoker, it's been enough to really shape my life in ways I don't like. One of the things I really miss is reading. Before I started smoking, I was an avid reader and would devour books about philosophy, history, and politics, as well as plenty of fiction. While I still read some on my own time (and still read for university), the time I spend there has drastically gone down and I feel so much dumber for it. Not only could I not read with all the time I was wasting just getting high and playing video games, but I also feel like my memory went to shit and any reading I actually did, I had god-awful retention of anything that I learned. This is not to mention how lazy I've gotten with homework and studying. While I still have good grades, I've just been doing the bare minimum and have lost the pleasure I had for my classes before.

Another area of my life that has been really affected by my smoking has been my social life. I've always struggled with maintaining an active social life as I have pretty bad social anxiety at times. While I mistakenly wanted to believe that weed was helping me in this respect, it was really making things worse. Weed made it so much easier for me to just bail on social events that I dreaded as well as stuff with friends so I could instead stay home, light up, and have a great time just chilling by myself. On top of this, I think it's helped make me a really boring person. Especially for the first year of smoking, I didn't *do* anything, really. Just spent so much time on my own getting high that I didn't really have anything to talk about to my friends. I think it's also increased my social anxiety and made me more self-conscious when I'm around other people. And now it's gotten to the point where I'll often start to just think about how much I'm fucking up whenever I smoke. It's gotten really unpleasant.

I'm in my final semester of my Bachelor's and I want to get my shit together. I'm applying for grad programs and I don't want to half-ass that like I've been half-assing my last two years of my current degree. I know I'm a really capable guy when I try and I'm tired of just checking out to chase a high that doesn't even feel good anymore. I want to really work on improving my social anxiety and getting back into the hobbies I left behind for smoking (like reading and making music).

None of these comments about weed are a condemnation of the plant. I had some really good times with it and want to maybe enjoy it in a more reserved and measured way later in my life. I think in a social setting, it's nice to hang with some friends and chill with a joint. But for now I think I need to take a year or so off and see how my life changes. I feel like I'm really out of touch with my sober self and want to work on life.

TL;DR: Smoking daily has led me to stop reading and trying in life (academically and professionally). Also really negatively affected my social life and turned me into a hermit. I need some good distance and time from the drug for a while to get perspective and change some things in my life.

Thanks for reading if you stuck through. Hope maybe someone can relate to this and that it perhaps helps strengthen their resolve to improve their life."

You're telling me you dont think of it as 179/180 days clean?  How is that not a win when dealing with addiction.

Stop restarting the clock on yourselves when you falter once.

Sure if you start using again for a week, then I can understand restarting the clock. But these ""I took one hit and threw ""x"" months down the drain is childish.  

You're better than that.

7 Years THC Free - just checking in,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h0i94a/7_years_thc_free_just_checking_in/,2020-06-10 23:32:36,"Today is my THC Free anniversary and I""m trying to make it a personal tradition to revisit this subreddit each year and do a little update. When I was in early recovery it really helped me to hear from folks who had a bit more time so I'm just trying to pass that along. It's also a chance for me to celebrate and recognize something that I honestly just don't think about in my daily life anymore!

You can see my previous posts for more detailed backstory:

[6 Months](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1t4pmh/6_months_detailed_story_ama/)

I've done so much over the past 7 years that I could not have done if I was still high all the time, or if I had killed myself. We are living through a time of such immense stress right now, on a global level, and I feel like I am returning more than ever to the skills I developed in early recovery. Last year I posted a timeline so here just two significant things that have happened since then. 

1. My spouse and I opened a small business 8 months ago. Obviously this is a really challenging time to be a small business owner but we are getting through it one day at a time - something I learned to do early in my recovery. 

2. Something I haven't mentioned in past posts is my physical pain, which has worsened a lot in the past year. I have had chronic migraine for a few years and this year I also got a fibromyalgia diagnosis because of my constant chronic body pain. It is challenging to engage with the online support communities for these conditions because a lot of people recommend medical marijuana which obviously isn't an option for me. I also wonder if my drug use was somewhat keeping these symptoms at bay when I was still smoking.

To anyone who is starting their recovery right now - you are doing a great job & I am proud of you! To the mods - it is so wonderful to come back to this sub and see how the community has grown, y'all are amazing. 

I don't know if I'll have the energy to answer too many questions today but I'll try to check this account over the coming week or so as I am able."
One year sober today!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gaoki5/one_year_sober_today/,2020-04-30 08:00:45,"After years of heavy smoking, on this day last year I had my last bowl and said goodbye to an addiction that had a strong grip on my life, friendships, finances and everything I thought I was. Sobriety forced me to re-evaluate how I dealt with my emotions, daily routines and really actually learn who I am. I am healthier, happier, far more successful. I have hobbies and much more meaningful friendships than just seshing up together to smoke all of our money, and for me it was the best decision I’ve ever made. The first year has been filled with some really fucking hard moments but a lot more satisfying ones, and I’m so excited to hit every other year after this.

I am fucking stoked! Much love to all here, I can’t wait to celebrate everyone else’s sobriety goals with them. You all rock"
"Advice from a former stoner, and reassurance that you too can quit just like me!",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dfi3gw/advice_from_a_former_stoner_and_reassurance_that/,2019-10-09 18:49:42,"To start this post off I want to say that for 4 years I probably smoked on average 4-5 Grams a day, sometimes getting so stoned I kind of just witnessed the world go by each day like a television with a sitcom on in the background. I would stuff my face with large quantities of food after every session as it was my favorite thing to do, and I will say the taste of food once the munchies hit might be the one thing I miss the most, then once I got home porn and masturbation were a necessity, and lastly video games until I fell asleep. Does this sound similar to your every day or your life? If it is you’re living in absolute hell and you’re not even living, you’re just existing. Good news is that if you’re on this sub you’ve already had the groundbreaking realization that getting high all the time might be harmful to you, maybe not physically but it damn sure does keep you from living life. Withdrawals are hell, you probably won’t be able to eat and you probably won’t be able to sleep, night terrors were a thing or me, especially when dreams came back very vividly. The BEST advice I have for this is melatonin really helped me in terms of getting proper rest through the first week or so. 

What I can tell you for sure though is I’ve been marijuana free for a whole year now, and yes the mental clarity comes back, and yes enjoying the little things come back, and yes life is absolutely beautiful and fun, and god I laugh at things now I would have never taken notice of in my hazy days. I’ve formed many great relationships over the past year, namely being my Girlfriend of 7 months who I never ever would have had the courage to talk to without the mental clarity of being clean, I’ve started college this summer and currently in pursuit of my bachelors degree along with transferring to a large university this coming spring. I feel smarter than ever, the wit I had as a young high schooler is back and it’s sharp as a tack. Meanwhile all my friends who are still getting stoned are doing the exact SAME thing and in the exact SAME place they were a year ago and many of them have excommunicated me, or just simply don’t talk to me anymore, minus a few. This is okay with me because it wasn’t by ill will on my part. 

The best possible piece of advice I can give and this covers almost any basis, in this life you’re given an amount of energy each day, and what you spend it on each day is what your life will manifest itself into, put it into relationships, your job, your education, and maybe even pursuing a spiritual path. Don’t waste your energy, put it into things that will grow and give back to you, learn to love yourself and life again not a plant that’s holding you back. I wish all of you the best of luck and I know it’s hard, but it’s attainable and life on the other side is wonderful!"

Smoked again after a two month break and it was the best decision ever: it made me realise why I quit in the first place.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hqrpjo/smoked_again_after_a_two_month_break_and_it_was/,2020-07-14 04:53:23,"After two months of being alcohol, weed, sugar and caffeine free - I decided to smoke a few puffs at my best friend’s birthday, thinking I’m over the hump and won’t want to go back to smoking on a regular basis anymore. This turned out to be true, I have no intention of brining weed back into my life and here’s why:

1) Smoking made me antisocial and ended up falling asleep on the sofa  during the party
2) It made me slow and lazy again in the last few days
3) Intense dreams and insomnia are back
4) My anxiety is back - not as intense before, but annoying enough. 
5) My stomach is almost as upset as it was the first week into quitting after smoking every day
6) I’ve been working really hard on my mental health and now my feelings are a bit numb again

To sum it up, I’m almost back to where I started in terms of physical symptoms, but I have no regrets. Now I know that even a small slip can set you back massively and not worth throwing away all the hard work and progress for a little high and not being the only sober person in a social situation. 

If you’re having a weak moment, stay strong. Or if you happen to slip just be forgiving with yourself and take it as a reminder of why you made the decision to quit originally and bounce back to your healthy life straight away.

Just hit 2 years.

Along the way, I endured the death of my dad, my dog, my kid getting expelled, another with serious depression, a custody battle with my estranged wife, being totally broke, and friends telling me weed isn't addictive and PAWS doesn't exist.

 I think most advice is useless, but offer mine now as a way of showing gratitude to the universe...as a matter of fact that's the first one:

1)  Develop the habit and attitude of gratitude, which lifts your mood, offers inner prace, and attracts all the positive things in life.

2) Exercise every day you can. Many of us are anxious to begin with, and it can be difficult to meditate, but you can sweat out much of the nervous energy that led you to weed.

3) Be stubborn about avoiding weed. Some days, I can't even remember why I quit, but I just say no anyway. Being stubborn is generally a negative behavior, but when it comes to weed, sometimes you don't need to think, just refuse to turn back the clock and go back to day 1 of quitting, because just one puff and you WILL remember why you quit.

4) Rise above it. No matter what life throws at you,   you don't need to react, or argue, or get down into the negative weeds. Stop fighting life, you have only so much control, give up, accept, and do what it takes to get past it and move on."

On a bike ride around the lake today I was smiling and said aloud to myself, ""you see \*my name\*, good things happen when you stop smoking"".

When weed is in your life, you may notice better moods, more motivation, and overall better functioning than when you are sober.

It's important to remember, however, that this doesn't necessarily mean weed is helping you. You might just be dependent on it, meaning you function worse without it, which is objectively NOT helping you. Functioning without any outside help is so freeing, and is so much more real than with pot.

Give sobriety a try for a few months, and when everything is sort of reset, you might be surprised how low your quality of life was without even truly  noticing."
Goodbye weed! It was a good ride but I’m moving on with my life now. 😁,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i2b50a/goodbye_weed_it_was_a_good_ride_but_im_moving_on/,2020-08-02 16:18:04,"  I’m usually just a lurker but I thought sharing my experience might help someone else so here I am. I smoked daily for the good part of two years, and it was great I was able to unwind and relax at the end of the day and drift off to a peaceful sleep. 

  The problems started when I had to stay home for the majority of the time due to COVID (student on summer break). During this time, I was going to be staying with my parents who aren’t very drug friendly so I was planning on quitting but after a couple weeks of being sober, I was looking for a fix again. I couldn’t smoke anymore since I was now living with my conservative family and it would be too obvious. I was looking for ways I could get high and I saw that edibles would be a discreet way I could. One thing led to another and I was now hiding edibles in my room and starting my day off by getting high. So the days went by like this, with me stoned in my room watching movies and playing video games and laying in bed all day. 

  Then things got even worse. I was a porn addict but I managed to get it under control by replacing it with a good habit of working out and even managed to start dating a bit which was the main part of my life that the porn addiction was affecting. Flash forward back to the beginning of quarantine, I was spending my days high as a kite and as many of you might have experienced it quickly gets boring and you have to do more and more to get that dopamine rush. This was the perfect storm for my porn addiction to come roaring back and now I was getting high and watching porn multiple times a day. The months went on like this in a blur, and one day I saw the date and I couldn’t believe that it had been almost 4 months. I was consuming an ungodly amount of edibles and spending hundreds of dollars a month. I barely spoke to any of my friends during this time and often ignored their attempts to reach out since I was too busy getting high. 

  I realized that this had to stop and this wasn’t the person I wanted to be, and started searching for help online on how to get my life back on track. This subreddit was a great help, I saw the stories of so many people who took back control of their lives from weed and decided that enough was enough. It’s now been 4 days that I’ve been sober and today I even went out and went for a jog around the neighborhood. My biggest challenge has been that I haven’t been able to fall asleep, I’ve been sleeping 3-4 hours a day on average. (If anyone has dealt with this, please tell me what worked for you). I’m still going strong though, and I know I can keep going with all the support this community provides. To anyone else dealing with similar problems, I hope my story helps you on your journey of staying sober. I’m here along with the rest of this subreddit to support you.

Smoking weed to suppress your emotions is like paying for a credit card with a credit card.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cdf6mz/smoking_weed_to_suppress_your_emotions_is_like/,2019-07-15 13:11:39,"I'm realizing this now. By medicating emotions with weed you're only digging yourself deeper and you're going to have to do that much more work eventually to dig yourself out of the hole.

Weed ruined my dental hygiene habits,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gk7ene/weed_ruined_my_dental_hygiene_habits/,2020-05-15 15:30:24,"As gross as it sounds, one of the things that weed really screws up in my life is dental hygiene. 

I have one of those electric toothbrushes that syncs up with your phone recording how often you brushed your teeth and I just saw this correlation between me starting to go harder on the smoking and the decline in how often I brush my teeth. 

I didn't realize this because you know how it is when weed starts taking over your life, you decide to skip on certain things for a few days and before you know it, it becomes a habit.

I'm done with that. We are all lazy and weed is an enabler of that and I'm done arguing with people that keep lying to themselves about how weed is not affecting their lifestyle. It's not that I'm going around people telling them to stop smoking but quite the opposite, it's people disagreeing with my choices because it makes them question their own.

It's interesting, I don't know anyone that has abused substances as much as I have and yet I see things that they don't and never get defensive like that.

Stay strong and don't get discouraged by people that don't know what they are talking about!"

&#x200B;

Id just like to celebrate with this sub. I have not been posting since my first 2 months. But god damn this sub was so helpful for me. I used to write here almost every day. And it helped me a lot. For those of you who still struggle or to those of you who just hit your first 24 hours. TALK! Please talk to people, talk to them about your feelings. Its okay, the first few days/ weeks are such an emotional rollercoaster. 

&#x200B;

Its okay to cry, its okay to not know what to do anymore, its okay to completely breakdown.. The days are long the nights are even longer. No matter how cliche this sounds. But it will get easier. Reach out! look for a proffesional to help you.

&#x200B;

I had a supportive family, i had therapy for 2 times a week. And all my friends supported me (eventhough a lot of them kept smoking) 

&#x200B;

Its such a great life, it gets better. When i started this journey. I lived with my parents, i was unemployed, looking for the purpose in life. Now 2 years later; I got a house, i got a girlfriend, i got 2 cats, im studying healthcare (to help people fight against their addiction). Things will get easier.. i cant sweat it enough.. Just hang in there..

&#x200B;

Once again thank you for listening.

Thanks for the awards heroes!!"

I guess this is how the addict brain works. Now that I’ve made it through the worst withdrawals and “proved” to myself I can be sober, my dumbass started thinking maybe I could smoke since it’s the weekend. One hit couldn’t hurt, right? Wrong! 

How long before the weekend turns into just at night? And how long before just at night turns into all day? Given my history, it probably wouldn’t take long before I once again turned into an all day everyday self-loathing stoner. Fuck that! I’m not going to fall for that shit. 

Just had to get this internal struggle off my chest. Felt like I had to write this out as a response to my addict brain that keeps trying to tempt me. If anyone else feels like telling my addict brain to fuck off, please feel free to do so.

4 months completely sober today,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i5ejm6/4_months_completely_sober_today/,2020-08-07 18:13:36,"No weed no alcohol for 4 months today! This by far the longest sober streak I've had since I was 12 years old, and I am 54 now.  That's kind of shocking to write down.  

My like isn't paradise, it's largely the same.  The difference is that I am present for everything and I have been brave enough to face all of my challenges without intoxicating myself to cope.  

I credit therapy, a focus on radical acceptance, and mindfulness. I am learning to accept and appreciate all experiences, good and bad.  It's not easy, but it has given me so much self esteem that I've lacked.  I can do this and I don't need weed to feel good when I'm unhappy or to enhance experiences. I love the freedom of not needing to constantly think about my next high. 

 Other things I like- no brain fog, better memory and better energy, I wake up easier in the morning, I am more relaxed and less anxious, and I'm more in touch with my true feelings now.  Before I didn't know what I was feeling most of the time. I was so anxious until I got high again.  Then the anxiety cycle repeated time after time, day after day.  Yuck.

I like this new me so much better, I think I am on my way to a better life.  This sub has been a great help to me.   I will keep coming back to remind me what early sobriety is like and try and help others however I can. For those thinking about giving up weed, I can honestly say it is a great move and the short term withdrawal is very much worth it!  I also want to encourage those that try to stop and relapse, it's ok, it's taken me many many tries.  Don't get down on yourself, it's a process, just keep trying. Persistence is key- this drug is stubborn!

I cry almost every day,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/blri9y/i_cry_almost_every_day/,2019-05-07 18:41:39,"I smoked heavily from the age of 15. I'm now almost 28. 4 years ago I moved from my home country (where grass is crappy / expensive) to a new one (where grass is HQ / cheap and, more recently, legal). I moved here to be with the woman I love, a woman who, thanks to a weed-related breakdown early in our relationship, didn't want me smoking. So I quit. And I quit again. And again. But every time, I would take it back up, because I'm weak. I would smoke behind her back very frequently. I would actually *look forward* to days that she would get home from work late, or go out with her friends, because it meant I got to smoke. She never found out, but it ate away at me, and our relationship.

We broke up 3 months ago, after almost 5 years together. It was amicable, she said we both tried our best, but it just didn't work. But the truth is I didn't try my best. I never tried my best for her. Because weed was my focus, against my own will and judgement, and it tore me away from her, made me love her less. And I can never tell her that. I can never tell her that our relationship could have been *so* much more if I had just been stronger for us.

I've been off the stuff now for 8 days.This is (at least) my 15th serious attempt at quitting, and I'm determined to make it stick this time. I've thrown so much of my life away because of my need to smoke and I'm sick of it. My thoughts are getting clearer, I'm at the gym every day, but it's so damn hard. Quitting tobacco on the same day probably wasn't the best idea, but that was something I lied about as well, and I'm dedicated to leaving the old me, the disgusting liar me, in the past.

Like the title says, every day is a struggle. I can't tell if the tears are because I miss her, or just a withdrawal effect, or both. The first few months since the break-up were much easier, and I really didn't feel all that sad, so I'm inclined to think it's the latter.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I guess I'm just writing this all out for my own sake, but also to thank everyone in this group from the bottom of my heart, because whenever I feel like there's a pile of rocks on my chest and I start to consider driving to the dispensary on my way home from work, I head to r/leaves and find so much inspiration to keep me on the path.

For me, it originally started out as a social activity, then became a social activity, which them became a personal activity which I used the guise of ""self-medication"".

It got to the point whereby I was smoking a full Ounce in a week - depending on the type of Cannabis, it'd cost me between £140/150 (Stardawg) or £160-175 (Lemon/Pineapple/Amnesia Haze).

I am massively addicted to the drug from a psychological and emotional perspective. It's going to sound really sad but Cannabis was my best friend that got me through some really tough times.

On the other hand it makes me incredibly lazy and dopey and as I procrastinate regularly anyway, it makes my laziness stronger.

My last smoke was approx midnight on the 24th, about hours ago now. I haven't made it this long in my home country - I only ever stop smoking when I'm on holiday and physically cannot get hold of any.

If you’ve quit for a day, a week, or a month, it doesn’t matter - you didn’t quit because you dislike weed (I would imagine)... you quit because you lack self control. 

If you’re a day, or week, or month, or year in, and say, “see I can quit just fine”, then you’re still controlled by your desire for escapism. You still don’t have control. If you’re thinking about it daily, you still don’t have control. If you’re thinking “I’ve quit for long enough”, you still don’t have control

When you return to weed, it needs to be like returning to green beans, if you haven’t had them in a while. You don’t count the days since you last had green beans, you don’t care if you don’t finish your green beans and throw them away. You can have them right in front of you and be indifferent. 

Once you are truly, truly, indifferent to smoking again, then you can smoke freely. I have quit for months and not been over it then relapsed, and was quickly addicted again, because the addiction was still alive, waiting to be fed again. Only if your honest with yourself, will you know that you’re truly in a different place. I doubt I will be for years. 

I will not smoke with you today. I may tomorrow, but just not today. I am still addicted. Good thing tomorrow isn’t real. 

Weed isn’t going anywhere, and you’re not going anywhere while your still in a hole. Get out of the hole and you just may realize that weed was never the problem, it was just the solution. Fix the problem, then you can truly enjoy weed again, if you so choose at the time. 

Peace.

Finally at home and can edit this. First of all, thanks for the nice response, wasn't expecting that. 

Second, I want to address a point I heard in the comments that is worth serious consideration. Instead of trying to rearticulate it, here's the comment. 

>Even after decades and thinking your in the clear and becoming indifferent an addiction could sneak up on you if you go back to using the substance you were addicted to - i guess that's where i disagree with what you said.

 It will always be there, and maybe we can control it, but maybe we should be thankful once we reach the ""green bean"" status, opposed to testing our luck again."
7 months sober...and I found a weed pen in my jacket pocket,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dqp8ti/7_months_soberand_i_found_a_weed_pen_in_my_jacket/,2019-11-02 23:39:40,"Hi everyone! As I said I’m 7 months sober and my life has improved dramatically. I’ve truly never been this stable and content before. However, recently I haven’t been so good about making my sobriety a top priority compared to when I first got sober. I haven’t been going to as many meetings etc. So yesterday I go to a meeting where I talk about how I’m getting sloppy with my sobriety and need to refocus myself. I’m walking out of the meeting to the subway and I feel this hard thing in my pocket. I haven’t worn this jacket since last winter. I pull it out and it’s a weed pen (weed was my drug of choice). I was in shock. I haven’t touched a weed pen in 7 months. A devil voice in my head tells me to check and see if it’s charged. I press the button and it is. I had the thought like wow just take a puff, take a hit. I immediately called a sober friend who told me to throw it out. I went to a trash can and held it over the trash. I literally couldn’t let it go. Finally, I did. But then as I was walking into the subway station, I had a wave of regret and thought, “you should go back to the trash and get it” HOW DISGUSTING. Like first of all, I would’ve looked crazy rummaging through a trash can and second of all, that’s gross. I’ve talked about it with many friends and they’re all proud of me for throwing it out. But it was scary that it was so hard to let go of. It reminds me that we are always so close to relapsing and sobriety is so fragile. I cannot believe I was able to throw it out without taking a hit. If I can do that, anything is possible. Love this sub. Thanks for reading."
Hard drugs destroy what you are. Weed destroys what you can be.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5waxnv/hard_drugs_destroy_what_you_are_weed_destroys/,2017-02-26 19:42:57,"Heroin and meth have effects that can be seen, that can be measured physically over time. That's why there's such a strong stance against them with no support.

Weed, however, has no physical or obvious effects that can be detrimental overall. It's the cognitive ability that is effected by weed. It destroys your habits, your thought processes, your judgement, your potential. The argument that weed is the best alternative to hard drugs is correct, but that doesn't mean that it is harmless. The least of all the evils is still evil. If you have the ability of moderation, then by all means go for it. But some people, a lot of people, don't. Whether they realize it or not. 

I've been battling in my head whether weed is ""really all that bad."" The fact that I even need to debate it is the key thing that drove me to quitting. I've relapsed several times, and each one I've literally gone out on my deck and paced, pondering whether or not it's such a horrible thing. When I quit, I feel good, make better decisions, learn things easier, cultivate my skills in my passions and hobbies, create better habits, my mood and overall well-being is greatly improved. 

Why do I keep debating on whether or not I should give that up for a few minutes of dopamine? Natural highs are way better, and have a much greater payoff: A good life. Not a good FEELING life. 

I can trust my judgement now, and my life is 100x better without it. I also know that moderation isn't an option for me. I can trust that too. 

Fuck you, weed. You robbed me of a year and a half of my life that could've been spent building a better one. Now's a good a time as any to start though. 

Thanks for letting me ramble. Have a good day everyone."
Having a clearer mind has let me see the damage I've done,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/glz23e/having_a_clearer_mind_has_let_me_see_the_damage/,2020-05-18 14:34:45,"This isn't going to be the usual 'my life is so much better since I quit' type of post, but more a 'shit, reality has smacked me in the chops, what the fuck have I done' type of post.

I decided to quit just after the new year, it's been over 4 months now. My head is so much clearer, I can focus better and my memory is getting better. But this has had a downside, because now I see the damage I've caused to not just my own life, but the others around me.

I'm about to turn 41, I've alienated myself from all the people I once had in my life. I've lost my partner, who was the best thing to have ever happened to me, through inaction and being lazy, inconsiderate and completely selfish. Because of this I no longer get to live with my beautifully incredible son which hurts every day that I have to leave him behind to go home. I've closed doors in my life that I'm not even sure I can open again. Over 20 years of this habit all I've done is create my own prison for myself, all I wanted to do was get home from work, get my son to bed and get high watching television. I neglected the most important people in my life time and time again, through the money spent and time wasted I took their right to a happy, fulfilled family and smoked it. At the same time I neglected my mental health, I spent years with crippling depression and anxiety, not even thinking that all I was doing by smoking was making it worse. I created masks for myself to hide my mental health, I hid lifelong conditions that I didn't realise I even had because being high all the time did a great job of keeping me from realising my issues. These masks I made for myself have been hard to take off, but I'm glad that I have done.

Over 4 months in and I'm never going back, I'm receiving therapy again to deal with the regret that I've left myself with, the biggest being not doing this sooner when the people around me were ringing the alarm bells as loud as they could. If I'd paid attention to the people that loved me I wouldn't have to go home at night and look at my walls, with nothing but the deafening silence of all I've lost ringing in my head, instead of the alarm bells from the people I love trying to warn me when I wasn't listening.

Despite the failures and the regrets that I've caused myself, I'm sure that I will get things back on track again. I can't quite just hit the reset button, I have to deal with what I've created, but I can try and start a new chapter for myself. Thanks for listening."

Anxiety: my body used to get cannabis to calm it down, and now my body forgot how to handle it. It's a muscle that i have to train.

Depression: my body was happy, and now it forgot how to be happy and produce the happy chemicals.

Breathing: my body forgot how to breathe, and now it realized it was going through a trauma, with a little physical activity everyday, it will get better.

Social events: my body forgot that hanging around smoking joints isn't enough for a social life, now it has to learn again to join the community.

Fulfillment: One joint and I'm satisfied and that explains why I didn't do anything with my life, my body is now craving fulfillment.

Memory: my body's brain activities were damaged, and it has to learn all over again to analyze and concentrate.

Appetite: my bodys appetite used to be induced by cannabis and now it lost it, it needs to learn to want things again.

Surviving the trauma of weed... This means now it's in physical and mental therapy... We have to learn how to do everything all over again, I know we all wanna feel normal, but we can't, we have to learn a lot of stuff all over again.

Just wanted to check in as it has officially been 2 years since I quit. My last time smoking was the last day of Memorial day in 2018. I was at a bachelor party in Las Vegas and used that as my ""last time I would ever smoke weed"" and I am pleased to say I have not touched it since.   


From a daily heavy smoker, to now free from weed, tobacco, vapes, etc.  


If you told me 3 years ago that I would quit, cold turkey, and not even miss smoking weed, I would tell you that you were crazy. But here I am, 2 years later, looking back and being so thankful that I made that decision.   


It wasn't easy. I quit many time before that and never was successful. But, here I am, 2 years without weed.   


It was probably the best single decision I have ever made in my life.

I've realised that the idea of smoking is far more appealing than the reality of it. I can picture it in my head right now. Smoke a few bowls, play some video games, fuck around on the internet, maybe watch a film. Sounds like a good time, and in all honesty it should be, right?

But I am an addict. I can't control my weed smoking -- at all. I get up mid day, have a shower, eat something, then blaze up. I find that I can't stop clock watching. How is it only 3pm? I feel so tired and lethargic...am I even high? Or is this just a headache? I could really go for a nap right now. Why not? An hour or two later of drifting in and out of sleep leaves me in a zombie like state. Wait, did I even sleep? Or was I just sitting with my eyes closed, in a stoned daze?

Again, I find myself clock watching. I smoke in periods - mid day, then the evening, then at night before bed. So I'm clock watching, waiting for the next period of the day to start, so I can fill my bong full of ice and blaze a few bowls. See, I wouldn't need to do this if I was rich and had a huge pile of weed, but I'm not. I find myself tactically smoking to try and stretch every last gram. 

I've come to the realisation that this isn't fun. I came to that conclusion years ago, yet here I am still smoking at least a gram a day. It's just too fucking easy to let yourself continue doing it, even if you hate it. Because at the end of the day it numbs you to that hate. You stick to the idea of smoking weed, and how great it seems in your head. Yeah, can't wait to smoke this fat bowl, even though deep down I know in a couple hours I'll be sat feeling shit, wondering what the fuck it is I'm doing with my life.

I'm spending £10 a day just to pass the time, when I could be doing something constructive...for free. Fuck this, fuck weed, and fuck any urge to smoke. 

**And then it clicked.** I have this urge to smoke...but that urge stems from that idea. The idea that smoking will be fun. I've smoked enough to know that it'll be nothing like that, so the urge, in a sense, becomes moot. That urge means fucking nothing because I know getting stoned just makes me feel like shit these days. 

*The idea of smoking weed is great.* But for someone who ends up smoking all day everyday, it just isn't.

If anyone read all this shit, thanks. If you're struggling, stay strong. We got this."
This will be the first 4/20 in 4 years that I will not smoke weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g2mv7f/this_will_be_the_first_420_in_4_years_that_i_will/,2020-04-17 00:25:02,"You know what I realised? I have a perfectionist problem. My body yearns to be the best, does not matter what. Mathematics? I have to be the greatest. Writing? Lookin' at Albert Camus right here. Music? Nobody knows better tracks than I do! 

I could go on and on. You know what is the problem? I was never the best at anything. As a matter of fact, I never gave it a shot. Why?

It's hard.

Anyone who ever tried to pick up a skill knows the frustration of the learning period, of the countless hours lost in picking up the basics of a craft, of learning on your mistakes. Point is, it is important to let yourself experiment and see what works. If it doesn't work the first time, it might work the 10th.

See, I do not know this feeling. Every time I tried to get involved into a hobby or skill, I would quit on the first real obstacle. Can't play this song after practicing for 20 minutes? Give up the guitar, there is no point if you're not going to be the new Jimi Hendrix.
You can't solve the math problem at hand from the first try? Must be too hard to solve, look up the solution.

Looking back, weed never made me an unmotivated perfectionist. I always had it in me, ever since elementary school. The problem is that weed made me okay with being that. It taps into this basic primal urge of constant change in a human (the kind of change which forces you to pick up a skill, to try and hook up with girls, to go out and experience nature) by shutting it down. Why be the best when you can let a person who's born to be the best fulfill their destiny? Just be average, there is no shame in that...

Except when you quit. Suddenly, you start looking around, and see all of your friends playing an instrument, drawing in their spare time, writing poetry, exploring on foot. What do you do in your spare time? Spend it on some godforsaken part of YouTube you did not even now exists. Oh look, a speedrun of a game you have no interest of ever playing? More interesting than the book at your bedside you've been planing to read for months, but never got to do it. Scrolling through social media to see new posts from people you absolutely do not give a shit about on things which could not interest you less? Better than picking up the guitar and practicing.

Looking back, I lied by saying that I wasn't the best at anything.

I am the best at avoiding living. I am the best at giving excuses. I am the best at lying to myself. 

Been sober for 17 days, and plan on staying sober for months to come. I might not be the best, but I will become the best I can be."

Thank you to this community for the love & support.

This journey hasn't been easy but it gets easier all the time.

For those interested in how I got this far I small chunked it. I started with a plan of making it 1 year, but from 0 to a year is a giant leap.
I quit 1 day at a time. Sometimes I got cravings & they usually went away by the time I woke up. Weirdly I got cravings as far as 250 days into my quit.

It feels a little surreal, I know I haven't smoked for a whole year, it used to be such a big thing for me, now I don't evenue give a shit about the stuff.

For those of you who are beggining or on this journey & struggling remember, nobody is cut from a different cloth, if I can do it you have the power in yourself to accomplish the same thing.

Working out is massive & has changed my life all on its own."

Holy smokes! 1 month sober. After being a hardcore stoner for 10 years..Here are my thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/73witu/holy_smokes_1_month_sober_after_being_a_hardcore/,2017-10-03 03:13:38,"1.) MUCH less paranoia. Not nervous at all in public and literally have no fear of social interactions. 
2.) Energy levels are much higher. Especially in the morning. 
3.) Sleep is much better. Dreams are vivid. Wake up well rested. This makes a huuuge difference.
4.) More money in my bank account. $$$$$$
5.) More drive/ambition. I've been running and excelling in school. Looking forward to the future and everything this world has to offer.
6.) Mood is much better. I find myself smiling a lot. Even when I am alone. Feeling really happy with myself.
7.) Saved lots of gas money. No longer do I go on long roadies and risk getting pulled over and caught with weed/pipes.
8.) Clear headed. Able to retain information much better. I can actually engage in decent conversation, look people in the eyes, and don't just mumble and sound retarded when I speak.
9.) Healthier eating. I haven't really binge ate  anything and I don't stuff my face like I used to when I was stoned 24/7.
10.) Life in general is 10x better. I can't believe I smoked so much everyday for the last decade. What was I thinking? 

Everyone who wants to quit...Who is ready to quit...Life is better without weed dragging you down. Sober life is the good life. Don't be scared. Make the change. Be all you can be. Be weed free."

Stop counting and start living,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hsa6d7/stop_counting_and_start_living/,2020-07-16 18:02:22,"I read this tip on here, some person in the comments said this. One guy was happy cause he reached a certain milestone, and somebody answered: stop counting and start living. 

For me personally, this has been the best advice EVER. When I first tried to stop, I gave myself milestones like a month or two months, but this justified ""trying again, cause maybe I learned to control it now"". As many of you know, that is a lie.

Anyway, with milestones, I feel like I'm forcing myself to think about the substance, and unintentionally keeping it a part of my life. But I want to GET RID OF IT. And to stop counting and start living has been the single best thing to keep in mind for me. When I ask myself now: how long has it been? I push that away and answer to myself: it doesn't matter, I'm living now.

Now this tip may not be for you, maybe setting goals with dates is simply the best approach for you. But if that has never worked, try this approach: stop counting and start living. Obviously, I know when I stopped -16 days ago, a bigger stop than I've had in years - and it's good to 'know'. But to think about it everyday has usually set me up for failure. 

I'm sorry if this mental approach doesn't help you, but it sure is helping me MOVING ON from weed."

Trauma is the real gateway,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dhyfma/trauma_is_the_real_gateway/,2019-10-15 02:40:52,"Things like cannabis, caffeine and alcohol are not the gateways. Things like molestation, childhood abuse, neglect and TRAUMA are the real gateways. These things manifest into addiction, hyper sexuality, violent tendencies, self harm etc. All of these things are the SYMPTOMS not the cause of a much larger issue. All of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. This is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications don't typically work. We need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from SELF.

Addiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. This behavior is then difficulty to give up. We need to realize that addiction is not a CHOICE, addiction is not an inherited disease. Addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. 

I think so many can agree, if able to put their egos aside, that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. Maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault, but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. Trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodies/minds (especially when children) cannot comprehend or process. These past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. When we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. I'm sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be, overworking, shopping, unhealthy/over eating, gambling, sex, drama, codependent relationships, etc.. We need to come together and stop judging one another. We need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause, the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. This is a sign of strength not weakness. Trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease, making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease.

TRAUMA is the real gateway."

When we quit weed...,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d0owt6/when_we_quit_weed/,2019-09-07 04:10:42,"When we quit weed, we aren't quitting the weed itself, we are quitting that 1-3 hours of escape from our daily lives, that has slowly become our life. We are quitting the warmth of the smoke/vapor in our hands and mouths, the comfort of holding something and being held in the soothing embrace of Mary Jane. We are quitting the clouding of emotions, investment, and clarity  We are quitting avoiding confrontation, complexity, and real acceptance. Too often we forget there is a reason why we start, and forget those reasons are waiting for us when we stop. 

Step one is to stop smoking.

Step two is to start living.

Been living with my friends who smoke but seeing how their lives revolve around weed makes me want to stay sober!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bm9wvx/been_living_with_my_friends_who_smoke_but_seeing/,2019-05-08 23:53:43,"In abscense of other living arrengements I moved in with my good mates, who smoke plenty of weed. Almost as much as me when I was smoking and just as compulsively. Before moving in I had my doubts, but after a week I've turned down a chance to smoke countless times already. And I don't want to smoke any more than I did three weeks ago.

In fact, seeing my mates' lives revolving around getting high makes me want to stay sober. I enjoy my life without constantly having to source the strongest pot and therefore being endlessly broke. I enjoy having a clear mind and waking up in the morning without sandpaper in my eyes and throath. I enjoy not having those anxiety loops as much as before. Living with my friends reminds me of my own habit and all the shit I put myself through because of it.

Almost half a year down and I'm really proud of myself."
Wish I had listened.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e9a4v2/wish_i_had_listened/,2019-12-11 20:31:21,"I remember the day I smoked weed for the very first time in freshman year of high school, when I was 14 years old. I was sitting in science class and my friend told me that he was about to score some weed after school and asked if I wanted to smoke some. I said Hell Yes, and we started talking about it. 

Our science teacher overheard our conversation and came up to us and said, “You are wasting your youth and you are going to waste your life with that crap.” 

We laughed at him, rolled our eyes, and made fun of him behind his back. We thought that what he said was total nonsense. 

Flash forward. I am 32 years old. Been smoking for 18 years, addicted to marijuana for 12 years. Guess what, I did waste my youth and my adult life getting high. 

Anyway, I am on Day 16 right now. I quit in the past (several times) but have always relapsed. Back here on leaves hoping to find some connection and support!"
10 years smoking weed everyday. I'm 25 now and coming to the harsh realization it has completely ruined me.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d6g6w2/10_years_smoking_weed_everyday_im_25_now_and/,2019-09-19 20:06:56,"Disclaimer: this is my first post, be gentle. Telling my story in the hopes that I can move forward and begin recovering.

I've smoked weed and drank heavily since I was 15. I'm the product of two neglectful, abusive parents but despite a difficult home life, I always felt I was quite resilient as a child. I remember praising myself often for being able to smile through the pain I was enduring.

I considered my young self an overachiever and a people pleaser. I was always very outgoing, was able to manage a lot of friend groups. I was on the honor roll every year and excelled at every sport I tried.

That all changed dramatically after I tried smoking weed in high school. I LOVED the feeling of getting high. It was an escape from all the inner demons I was trying to silently battle. I very quickly became emotionally dependent. I stopped going to class, only attending to smoke weed with my friends.

To make a long story short, I did this throughout my entire high school career and ended up being expelled but I didn't really care. I became withdrawn from people, judgemental and anxious.

Between then and now, I've had surprisingly good careers and been successful in a lot of aspects despite this. But I've always had this feeling I'd break one day. I could only hide my bad habits and mental state for so long.

That break finally came when I had my first panic attack on board a plane coming home from a vacation and got violently sick. It was the first vacation I'd been on in 9 years and rather than enjoying myself, I dealt with crazy anxiety and what I would assume was withdrawal from weed. All I could think about was getting home so I could finally smoke again.

I've been paranoid and horribly sick to my stomach every day since. My anxiety has been through the roof, I wake up at 4am daily and I often think I'm going to die soon. Because of this I have been smoking 2-3 bowls every hour or so to surpress the overload I'm experiencing.

I've completely withdrawn from the world since. I've lost most of my friends, I don't have any hobbies that require leaving my house and I work from home which doesn't help. I'm even having terrible anxiety thinking about posting this..

At this point I've realized that a vast majority of shitty events in my life and bad mental habits are centered around weed and alcohol. I've since quit drinking and am now 5 weeks sober in that regard and I desperately want to quit smoking weed too.

I've just ran out of weed today and am heading to  visit with a new doctor in an hour. I'm hopeful that today is the day I can finally be strong enough to turn a new leaf.

**UPDATE**

Hey guys, I wanted to pop on here with an update and say thank you for all the kind, encouraging messages here. I don't have many friends left to talk to, so to know I have a supportive and safe place here is a really nice feeling.

The doctor prescribed me a very low dose of anti-anxiety and depression medication. I have a moderate fear of prescription medication so I'm noticing I'm a lot more on edge and hypersensitive to how my body is feeling. I also feel like I'm just replacing one numbing substance with another.

Tonight was the third day taking a half dose and the initial side effects suck. The highlight is temporary (I hope) heightened anxiety, so I have a lot of moments of panic where I can't tell if I'm breathing. Kind of weird, but everything is feeling kind of weird right now so I'm taking it day by day.

I decided against quitting cold turkey. I got through one day, but combining withdrawal symptoms with the side effects of starting this new medication was way too much to handle. I'm kicking myself for that a bit, but I know I will get there eventually. Just a little slower.

I switched from smoking a strain with 18% THC between 10-15 times a day, to a strain with less than 4% THC and 14% CBD about 5 times a day. I've been struggling to eat or keep anything down so this has helped drastically with calming my nerves enough to get some food down.

My plan is to wean myself off of this CBD gradually over the next week or so. Maybe more. I realize I'm kind of navigating this as I go now, this feels VERY different from quitting drinking.

I'm going back to my doctor in a week and a half for a check-in, so I will update then on my progress! Thank you all again for being so kind and welcoming of my story and struggles. I appreciate the openness here ♥️"

It's not the substance itself,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/guccqu/its_not_the_substance_itself/,2020-06-01 06:36:57,"This happened to me today. 

I'm a full month without smoking. Today, I had to light something up and i caught the lighter. It was like meeting an old friend. The feeling of it in my hands, its weight... it just felt good. The weed didn't even took part on this sensation at all.

So it struck me. We are addicted to a substance? Yes. But the ritual itself takes a huge part on the addiction. It makes you feel you in the control (because its aways the same thing), and makes you feel you have some kind of company - the lighter, the pipe, the weed... all imaginary friends.

This mindset feels more reasonable for me. You're not fighting against an evil chemical that's imprisoning you. You fighting against habbits that you build for yourself. So all you gotta do is build another habbits. 

I know it's hard, but changing a habbit for a habbit seems more achievable than changing a chemical for a habbit, right? At least for me. Hope this insight helps you somehow. Good journey my friends!"

The reality, for myself, is that at some point of my stoner journey, weed wasn’t able to cover up all my emotional dilemmas anymore. It took 21 years but it happened oh man did it happen!

The strength and amounts just couldn’t do it anymore, I would smoke weed, eat weed, eat CBd, god damn I think I even thought once about snorting weed.  The diamonds, the shatters, the rigs and jigs, the pipes the Rollie’s the candied Rollie’s just to get that feeling of comfort within.  And when the amounts got so great just to get comfortable for a few minutes and so overpowering I just started to drop. And boy did I drop

Mental health was spiralling out of control, so what’s the best and only thing I knew is that I did not feel comfortable......... escalation occurred and voila I now had pharmaceutical speed AND WEED.  Wow, the cherry on top was back I could be with my weed and find all that false comfort again.  BUT WEED WAS NOT THE BLOODY PROBLEM RIGHT!  

My day came like so............... 21 years of pot smoking concluded in a brief moment. This is how it occurred 

Told my wife I needed to go to the spa

Anxiety filled my body due to the 30 lbs I had lost over the past year, I was to scared to show myself at a spa

Drove past

Drove for 5 hours into the mountains, mind spiralling, lost, confused 

Parked my car after getting the famous beyond meat burger 

Sitting in my car windows down 

My wife calls “ how was the spa babe “

I’m honest with her “ I’m not at the spa, I’m sitting in a parking lot 5 hours from home”

My wife “ what?, what are you doing?”

Me “ I don’t know anymore, I just don’t know anymore “

My wife “ come home”

Me “ I have a serious problem “

I felt hopeless, afraid, cold inside like steel, worthless, unloved, scared

The moment I saw and ADMITTED I had a serious drug problem that had been destroying my inside spirit for 21 years I felt really how badly I wanted to quit.  I no longer cared if it was just pot, I no longer lied to myself and said I got my shit under control, I no longer was afraid of asking for help or guidance, I admitted I was lost and I was a bloody addict.  The addiction lies within the user and not the type of substance.  I was just like all the rest of the addicts I had never been able to understand, I had a real problem

Today......... pffffffff.  I have done my work on myself trust in those words.  I am free from the active addiction and that is only understandable on this side of the fence.  

WE WILL ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT JOURNEY THROUGH THIS BUT NOBODY WILL SAY IF THEY ARE ADDICTED THAT ITS WAY BETTER BEING ADDICTED, they just simply can’t.  

This is my HONEST EXPERIENCE 
1. Freedom is so liberating
2. I have REAL confidence in myself
3. I am truly present for those around me 
4. When I deal with emotions I can actually deal with them and know that tomorrow will be a new day. Most of the time it’s very brief and I can resolve them by facing them 
5. My entire outlook on life has changed into something loving and positive 
6. I trust 
7. I now understand that some people can use marijuana freely and at will, NOT THIS GUY. 
8. I have learned that my body is actually a serious machine of self balancing without weed 
9. My mental health is on a whole other level of positivity
10. This is the most critical for me “ I LOVE ME”

So to anybody struggling just know that YOU CAN DO THIS but it starts with self honesty and then WORK ON YOURSELF AND FIND WHAT WILL HELP YOU WALK AWAY from active addiction. Don’t be afraid of being brutally honest with friend and family and build yourself the support YOU NEED.  Remember we are all in this together and there are so many resources available.  
I know for me I had to get help from sources and I followed the guidance from others because no matter how in control I thought I had been I knew I couldn’t control this and I bit my tongue and asked for help. 

And voila I am currently sitting just shy of 8 months, who would have ever thought eh!

Love you all"
Currently attempting cold turkey on a remote tropical island.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d4hjwn/currently_attempting_cold_turkey_on_a_remote/,2019-09-15 11:49:02,"**Update:** https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dfdmuo/desert_island_update_one_addiction_for_another/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

**Original Post:**

Finally snapped. 

On the spur of the moment, I quit my job and used all my savings to buy myself a ticket to a tiny island in the Philippenes. Been here 10 days so far. 50 days until my return flight. Probably a shitty descision but I'm commited now. 



**TLDR;** started great, plateaued, looking for solidarity and others in a similar stage of withdrawal. 



**Background:** 

(which I'm sure is all too familiar to many of you)


26yo, 9 years of being stoned (first joint 6:30 am before I get out of bed etc). Tried and failed to quit more times than I can count. Zero ability to moderate, mentally torturing myself every night for wasting another day of this precious life. 

For most of my life I've been focussed on the external world, flitting from one exciting thing to the next, searching for those little dopamine hits, jumping at every opportunity, agreeing to everthing. Never even taken a day to concentrate on myself. 

I've been high almost every day since I was 17, thus I haven't allowed myself to mature emotionally or socially since then. Don't even know how to deal with my emotions while sober. Weed allowed me to escape boredom, to be happy doing nothing. Suspect some underlying cause to this, perhaps mild ADHD. 

Despite my addiction I've managed to start building a successful career in industrial design, but I know I'm operating at like 20% capacity/effiency.  

Time and time again I tried to quit, and time and time again I failed. I might make it a week or two, but then work/social would get stressful and my willpower would evaporate. 





**Logic behind desert island rehab;**

Didn't feel like my addiction warranted conventional rehab, reinforced by the ""it's only weed dude"" attitude society seems to have. Debatable choice, but that was the descision. I also know I will feel far more proud of myself if I manage to do it on my own. 

I decided I needed a new environment without any stress or commitments, where my only goal would be making it through each day without getting high. Somewhere I could slowly build a routine back into my life, start exercising, start reading again etc. Somewhere with an exciting environment to explore once I was ready. 

I didn't want to be around friends or family during this time. I'm easily distracted, and I felt I needed to force myself to concentrate only on myself for an extended period of time. I also know I get very irratable when I try to quit, and I didn't want to inflict that on those I love and wear them down. 

I also knew I wanted some creature comforts, internet to aid in boredom and to communicate with friends when I need, healthy cheap food on tap, warm weather, the sea to swim in, a bit of the easy life. 

I'm aware that I'm essentially running away from my problems, and I will have to face real life again when I get back, but I felt like I needed to press the reset button, to snap myself out of the spiral, something I couldn't do at home. 

In line with another post I just saw here - when I'm sober I want to smoke and when I'm high I want to quit. I reasoned that buying a ticket during a moment of clarity would force me to adhere to that descision, and not just forget it the next morning. 

So I departed, armed with vallium, a kindle, a laptop and a hammock. 




**Experience so far:**

It's so interesting the psychological state you enter when you just know you can't get weed. Cravings and temptation haven't been an issue. (I'm aware that I can't rely on the lack of avaliblity of weed for ever, but I hope I'll be strong enough to resist when I return) 

Physically I've been a sweaty little mess, cracking headaches etc, but for me the scariest part is insomnia - but I've managed that with vallium, tapered it off from 20mg down to nothing, currently have had two nights sleep without any chemical aid. Feels great. Who knew it was so easy to get up in the morning!?

Feeling my brain come back online has been amazing. Mental clarity, the ability to hold a conversation, even the desire to converse with strangers, the ability to maintain eye contact, the ability to present a genuine smile. 

The island I'm on is tiny, maybe 1km long. It has a village of about 50 people, palm forests, crystal clear water, and a jungly mountain at one end. Im in a hut next to the beach with good LTE and some food stalls within walking distance. Food and accommodation is costing me about $20 a day. Paradise (apart from the nearby typhoon, but you can't have everthing I guess!)

I started out with vigour, excercise, attempted yoga, delving into my books. But I've plateaued, and the past few days I've been escaping into Netflix and my motivation to do anything else has evaporated. This would usually be when I would relapse. Not possible here, and I'm glad I've given myself so long out here. Not gonna be as easy as I thought. 

Emotional wobblies started yesterday, inexplicably found myself in tears. All the things I used to enjoy aren't appealing. Hours building playlists, days fiddling around making tracks on Logic or designs in illustrator - I just can't motivate myself. 

The hardest part is the evening. Usually I would be succumbing to the blissful fog of a hard day's smoking, but without weed I just don't know how to relax. 

I hope this phase passes. I know this will pass. But this is probably why rehab is best done in a group, so you can support each other during times like this. If anyone has read this ramble - thank you! I don't know quite why I'm writing it, probably in search of solidarity or another person going through the same stage of withdrawal. Very much up for DM ing if anyone's keen. 

Maybe I wrote it to remind myself why I'm here. Having done so and re-read my words, I suddenly feel like I can manage to get up and do 20 mins of exercise. Funny how the brain works. 

Good luck to everyone else out there trying to quit. We got this!

**Edit:** 

I have been totally bowled over by the outpouring of support from this community. To know there are so many people out there in similar positions, all able to coalesce into this mutually beneficial network - all rooting for one another, all at different stages of the process, all willing to offer insightful advice and comforting encouragement - what a phenomenon. 

I feel totally re-invigorated - I’m not just doing it for myself now, I’m also doing for all of you. We’re all doing it for each other. I’m prepared for the rest of the rollercoaster, and I’m hanging on tight. 

Also...my first and second silvers all in 24 hrs?! Thank you kind strangers - I totally assumed this post was going to be lost to the chasm.

 r/leaves, you guys are awesome!!!!!!!

I didn't enjoy drinking and hated the flavour of beer and how bloated alcohol made me feel. I am an overthinker so the weed helped surpress that. When i left school and started working, all of the responsibilties made my brain more active than when i was in my teenage years, i started smoking a lot more due to this and i never even realised i became dependant on it. I am 25 now and over the past few years i started to get severe anxiety when high and also SOBER, which never happened before i started smoking, this is the complete opposite effect of the previous 7-8 years of smoking. When locksdowns started happening in March i was a little relieved, it gave me a reason to stop both weed and cigarettes. Since locksdowns have loosened i have been with friends that still smoke and i declined!. The first few weeks were hell due to the increase in anxiety symptoms but i am now over that and i feel great, my anxiety is much lower, lungs are healing, smell better and thoughts feel less clouded. I am curently trying to train myself to use my overthinking in my advantage rather than disadvantage. I know its not good to subtitute but i now give myself Friday or Saturday to have a few sweet alcoholic drinks (still hate beer) just to get a little buzz.

I've already been sober for a month but I kept telling myself it was temporary, that I would smoke again once lockdown was over. But now that I'm sober I've realised I actually quite like not depending on weed. I couldn't have made this decision without reading all the amazing, supportive, encouraging posts on this sub.

I started to feel overwhelmed, so I went to chill on his balcony while they played more matches. I watched the cars go by on the highway and tried to keep my heart rate down, so anxious and stuck inside my head. 


Before I knew it, half an hour had passed. I felt better physically, but was upset to be missing out on time with friends. I went back inside, was able to focus again, and had some good hangout time. But I felt so sluggish and cloudy, even hours later.

Weed is my drug of choice, don't have issues with anything else.  I have no moderation or control over it.  It's an all or nothing for me.  

Used for 10+ years.  The last 4-5 of that being very heavy all day every day use.  Basically the routine of smoking before and during everything.  

Attempted to quit multiple times, only to be fooled thinking I could use in moderation.  Which would turn right back into smoking all day everyday. 

Got to a point where I was ready to quit for good.  So I started meditating every day for a month or two until I ran out.  Knowing meditation would help me through the month or so of withdraws.  And it definitely did.  Kept up on meditating daily which really helped keep me sober.

Several months after quitting I got a significantly better job, getting my foot in the door to a great career.  Which has been a big help as well.  

If I can quit and stay quit anyone can.  Not saying it's easy because it's not.  I just tried until I found what works for me and keeps me off of it."
Using Weed in Moderation IMPOSSIBLE for me - Totally abstaining is the only thing that works!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bfpkgo/using_weed_in_moderation_impossible_for_me/,2019-04-21 18:50:01,"12 Years, 9 Months Cannabis Free

After smoking weed for around ten years, my use had become too heavy and habitual for my liking. I tried to use it in moderation (""only on special occasions"" was what I was going for). Thanks to documenting my progress in a journal, I was eventually able to go back and see how often I'd slipped back to daily use. It felt so maddening to realize that I'd become addicted to this ""totally non-addictive"" substance. It took TEN YEARS of trying (and failing miserably) to smoke weed like someone who can take it or leave it -- I was so envious of people who could do this. For me, if I had it in the house, it would get smoked sooner of later. I had to come to the realization that I was NOT capable of smoking cannabis without relapsing back to daily use. I found a lot of helpful info online, and even joined an online support forum (the name is Uncommon Knowledge Forum -- based in the UK). Online community support, like what's being offered here, was the thing that allowed me to actually quit. 

Reading posts by other people who actually understand the struggle -- that we ""love"" weed, but it's no longer serving us, and we desperately want to quit (but a small part of us still wants to be able to smoke it now and then). The posts I'd read by other people with problematic, habitual weed use rang so true for me, validating my own experience. I no longer felt like some isolated weirdo with a problem I was facing alone: I felt like what I was going through was real, and that others were facing the exact same struggle. My battle felt a bit less overwhelming.

I started a list of ""Benefits of being off weed"" on the forum. Other people added their insights. By encouraging each other to see all the positives of quitting, the days off weed started to string together. I learned some basic tips to stay cannabis free: stay busy, do things that bring me joy (even at first I felt like a fraud, since there was little joy in the early days), surround myself with people who care about me, avoid situations that are going to trigger me (i.e. being super drunk or hungover around people who are smoking weed), treat myself to little rewards with the money I saved.

I am proud to say that after all those failed attempts at moderation, this time I have fully quit. I never want to ""jinx"" it and say that I've successfully quit forever, since there are times when I still get phantom cravings or weird addict-rationalizations about how ""it's been so long, you can have a toke now and not relapse."" I have been off cannabis since July 22, 2006. I still count my progress (in years and months now, not days), and I want to share my story. With weed now legal where I live, and dispensaries selling product near my house, I need to re-up my commitment to stay off. It was fun during the first years I smoked it, but it turned into a limiting addiction, slowly squeezing the juice of life from my existence. Now, after 12 years and 9 months (tomorrow) off weed, my life is better than ever.

I want to say THANKS to all of you in this community. By showing up authentically, sharing our stories and offering support (when asked), we help each other leave our weed habits behind and move into living our lives more fully."

Sticky Brain vs Slippy Brain,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hn7ywj/sticky_brain_vs_slippy_brain/,2020-07-08 05:46:25,"Here's how I think about weed (and by extension all drugs and alcohol). My vice has always been weed tho.

When we are born, we are constantly learning, and constantly remembering what we learn. Our brains are naturally sticky. We keep our eyes open, see the world, listen to people, take in all kinds of experiences and lessons from the people around us. Our brain is so sticky like fly paper taking everything in.

When we use drugs or alcohol to the point where it becomes habit, or routine, our brains lose their stickiness. And the more we use drugs for longer periods of time, our brains actually become slippery. We can still see and hear what's going on around us, but it doesn't stay in our minds. Memories start to fade, lessons have no meaning, we no longer truly experience anything. Everything just slips away in anticipation of the next toke. And so the cycle continues...

The good news is, our brains are naturally sticky! We can get back to that, it just takes a little self control and a lot of support, but it's worth it to experience life like we used to.

Stay strong my friends."
Relapsed after 5 years. Starting over tomorrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hlxqse/relapsed_after_5_years_starting_over_tomorrow/,2020-07-06 04:41:24,"I hadn’t touched weed in over 5 years until June 8th last month. 

Life has changed drastically since I used to be a stoner, and at the start this year I became increasingly intrigued with reintroducing Weed  for therapeutic and recreational benefits.

June 8th was the day I started smoking again and here’s what’s happened;

I exercised only once since ( I exercise and cross train daily, running, cycling, weight etc usually).  
I basically forgot that for 15yrs of my life I never worked out because Weed creates a force field of contentment with laziness. I’ve managed to reshape my life over the last 4 years to be a generally healthier individual .

I no longer identify with being a stoner but that’s what I’ve been doing these last 3 weeks and it’s been amazing to realize how I used to be to how I’ve grown to be so lazy.

So my quest to be a stoner again has yielded results. Cannabis is no longer of any real benefit to me. 


If anything it’s been largely negative. People have noticed how “stoned” I’ve become. Somebody picked it up at work that I was  tired looking etc. I found this embarrassing.

My girlfriend prefers the older version of me who looks after himself and doesn’t lounge around gaining weight and struggling to stay conscious because I’m so monged. 

I have a wheeze again after 5 years or good respiratory health.

I’ve put on over a stone in weight over the last few weeks too. Damn munchies 

So tomorrow I start without it. Exercise and healthy eating. And some sleepers for possible insomnia if needed.

It’s time to get er done and Start back in a righteous path.

What I do know is that, in a very real sense, my parents played a leading role in saddling my former innocent, impressionable child-self with this addiction. I find now, all these years later, that I carry around a lot of confusion, hurt, and anger toward my parents for this, especially now that my own son is 15 and I cannot fathom being the poor role-model for him that my parents were for me.

Today marks 2 years weed free,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eac5s7/today_marks_2_years_weed_free/,2019-12-14 02:57:08,"I smoked weed for 6 years from 16-22. I was a daily smoker pretty much from the time I began smoking. I was definitely a ""high functioning"" stoner so that made it pretty easy to excuse my habit. Overtime though, I just began to feel worse and worse every time I smoked. Every day would blend with next, I felt out of touch with myself and all of those around me. I felt like a shell of a person, and I was suppressing all of my emotions with the plant. I tried to quit probably 20 times but had no success...

Until two years ago, when I'd become a not so functional stoner. I had dropped out of college to sell weed, I partied every night, and cared very little about anyone but myself.

Then, one night that changed. I was doing what I always did: sitting in a big circle in my living room, me and my stoner buddies passing around a rig as we each took dabs. 

I had just taken a huge dab and I was dying, struggling to get oxygen into my lungs. I went into the bathroom and I remember I finally got myself together and I just stared into the mirror forever and pretty much just had an epiphany. I decided I was going to quit for real this time. 

It was hard. I tried to maintain my friendships at first but none of them respected the fact that I'd quit. Every time I saw them they'd ask me to smoke, or smoke around me. I also realized that a lot of people hung around just because I always had so much. So, I just had to cut them off all together. 

It was tough and lonely in the beginning. Every thing I'd been suppressing came to the surface and I had to deal with all of it. I had a few panic attacks and started to have really bad anxiety. I was also pissed most of the time, struggled to sleep, and my appetite was pretty much gone. I was in a deep pit of depression. 

I started to exercise, running a few miles every other day and that really sped things up, and helped me deal with the loss of something I was addicted to. I also started to fill that time I used to smoke with more productive things like reading, writing, working, and rekindling my relationships with my family members.

The first year was incredibly challenging, but since then hings have gotten progressively better. 

I've gotten into a committed relationship, went back to school and am majoring in computer science, I started writing again, I've got more money saved up than I ever have in my life, I'm happier and actually deal with my problems as they arise, I'm more assertive, and overall just a better person. 

So if you're struggling to quit, or if you've quit and it seems like nothing is getting better, just keep pushing through. Smoking isn't going to help your problems and its not going to make you feel any better!

It’s lovely, the peace and quiet, and the good vibes. I often walk down to the river by my house and enjoy the sound of it flowing. But suddenly i’d remember that i was walking alone at night, and that i’d have to sneak back into my home without getting caught smelling like weed, and thats when the paranoia sets in. Even though this happens almost every night I still decide to smoke. It’s funny how you forget the feeling the next morning just to experience it again later that night, it’s like a loop. 

But tonight I felt differently. I took a joint and went for a walk, but the entire time I felt like I was battling two sides of me. One side felt so deeply connected to my intuition, and every part of it was telling me not to smoke, but the other side kept luring me back into this loop where i’d tell myself “tonight’s the last night I smoke”, every single night. But I fought the urge the entire walk, I even extended my walk thinking i’d smoke, but I made it home sober and much less anxious than I would have!

Here’s to a happier and more peaceful life without weed. Weed will always be there but you won’t, here’s to 2 days sober :)"
Best decision ever,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ibkaee/best_decision_ever/,2020-08-17 22:52:00,I posted on here on my 9th day. I was struggling and in a very dark place unsure I was able to live that way. Today is day 77 and I’m so happy I stuck with it and allowed myself to love a free life. Today is my first day of college and not having to rely on weed is a dream come true. If you’re struggling just keep pushing because the pain is worth the reward I promise.

3 Tips for Success - what worked for me to finally kick the habit for good,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/iegdug/3_tips_for_success_what_worked_for_me_to_finally/,2020-08-22 14:48:10,"32M - smoking daily for 16 years. Now 60 days sober after years of failed attempts. Here are my 3 keys to success. I hope it helps you:

1. Keep track of your streak and closely follow it. There are countless apps to help remind you when was your last smoke. The bigger the streak the harder it becomes to break. If you are a gamer think of it like a video game high score. Don't keep a mental note. Download an app and add a widget or notification so you're reminded every day the current streak. Streaks that are kept in your head are easier to break. 

2. Decide you are not just someone trying to quit but that you are no longer a smoker. Act like you are no longer a smoker. It makes it way easier to quit when you've made the mental decision that you are not a smoker. People who don't smoke don't ask for hits, call their dealer, engage in cannabis content, bring weed to every activity. It's simply not part of their life. Fake it til you make it. You are not quitting smoking. You are simply not a smoker. 

3. After you are on a streak, even a day, reflect back and ask yourself if you wished you smoked since the last time. Do you wish you spent money on the weed you didn't smoke? Is the high worth being in a worse cognitive state than you are now? 99.99% of the time the answer is no. After 30 days you will feel so much sharper and have hundreds of extra dollars in your pocket. It will be hard to look back and say you wish you spent this money and that the high was worth it.

Hope this helps someone"
I broke my sobriety yesterday. Don't let yourself down if you give in. It is not over and you can just continue giving your best. Conscience is everything.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/foruz6/i_broke_my_sobriety_yesterday_dont_let_yourself/,2020-03-25 19:08:28,"Well, I could use the quarantine as an excuse. But to be real here : I decided to smoke again.

I have not been thinking about weed for the last 4 months. Turned my life around, started working out, took more responsibility at work, spent time with my dog and rekindled a lot of social contacts.

After nearly 3 years I feel good about myself again. I have a new flat, it is great and everything is under control. Then this fucking virus starts to cause chaos.

I got I believe 1 gram of a friend of mine. Yesterday I decided to smoke like half a joint from it. It was ok, nothing special. It is still the same. I went to bed, woke up today and continued as nothing happened.

I guess since I am not planning on becoming the stoner again (like from the bottom of my heart) it just wasn't that big of a deal to me. I am not disappointed, I am relieved somehow. That it didn't feel as good as I thought it would. That I am fine by leaving it be and be that guy who smokes occasionally. 

My sobriety will continue. I will just forget about it and continue everything I got going the last few months.

Don't be mad at yourself. Just continue with your efforts. It will get you somewhere in the end!"

Today is day 6. Rough day. Just got back from picking up some weed. I get a text from one of my best friends who knows I’m trying to quit telling me about this sub. Completely changed my mind.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bxa6ek/today_is_day_6_rough_day_just_got_back_from/,2019-06-06 04:34:29,"I have been smoking weed daily for over 2 years. I tell myself it’s okay because I usually don’t smoke til the evening. But I’ve realized that it’s one of the only things I look forward to, it’s something that inhibits me from living my life to the fullest and actually going out and doing things. It needs to stop. 

I moved across country last month, living in a place where I’m constantly surrounded by people, yet I know no one except my co-workers. It’s a strange feeling, living in a place where you are constantly surrounded by people, but really you’re completely alone.

I woke up this morning, to a rainy, dreary day on my day off. I haven’t found much to fill my time without work making my boredom painfully real and depressing. To add to this, I step outside to notice my lock has been chopped on my front porch, and my bike, which I cannot afford to replace has been stolen overnight.

I spent the better half of my day walking around town, checking local pawn shops and filing a police report. On top of this it had begun to rain heavily, I was cold uncomfortable and miserable.

After this I went home and tried to distract myself with video games, but this just ended up making me feel even more lonely, bored and useless. Another few hours went by, I thought the rain had passed, so I went down to the beach, where I normally go to clear my head, only to be rained on some more. 

In a depressive state, I said fuck it and on my way home I went into the local dispensary and bought some THC caps. I contemplated popping one right then and there on my walk home. But however I decided to wait until I get home, and really think about if I wanted to break my 6 days of sobriety. 

I sat on my couch, turned on Netflix and was about to take one. Just before I did, I checked my phone, to notice a text only minutes prior from my roommate and best friend back home. He knew I was trying to quit and informed me of this sub. It’s almost as if, in this moment, he felt my depressive state and reached out to me moments before I went too far, without even knowing it. 

As soon as he mentioned it, I looked at this sub, read multiple stories of people struggling just like me and decided, no I do not want to break my short lived sobriety. 

So for that, I thank all of you for taking the time to tell us, in this sub how you were feeling, how you’ve overcome that urge to smoke, and how awful you’ve felt when you break your sobriety. Your story means more than you know, keep with it, and thank you for reading mine. 

And to my best friend, my brother who reached out, love ya man xx."

Day 414 without weed. Living a better life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fec6ah/day_414_without_weed_living_a_better_life/,2020-03-06 14:28:50,"Hey Guys,

I've been lurking for so long, I can't even tell anymore.
Decided to share my story and thank all of you for supporting me without even knowing.

I (M28) started smoking weed at 13 yo and have been smoking (with several short pauses) pretty much all my life until last january. There were times I smoked less (several times a week to 0.5 gram daily) and times I smoked heavily (2-3 grams a day) but for most of the time I was smoking on a daily basis. 

Weed never felt like it would destroy my life but rather always felt like a good old friend I could always rely on. That is, what I consider it's greatest danger. The sublety of weed, making so many things so much more difficult.

Despite being diagnosed as a highly gifted kid at a young age and skipping first grade because I was able to read, write and do most of elementary school level maths in kindergarten.
 I often struggled in school, not because I couldn't follow the lessons but because I was often high in school or skipping school because of being high. In the end I still graduated my country's equivalent of high school, but had very bad grades and at some point almost got kicked out for being absent.

At 18 I moved out of my parents house and started going to university about 500km away. Living in a student dormitory I quickly started to bond with pretty much every other pothead and weed became an even bigger part of my life. 

When I went to the university it was almost exclusively for the few mandatory courses, exams or at a later point to work as a tutor. For the most part, I was just in that city to party and do drugs.
 I studied for 6 years and didn't even get my bachelors degree, even though I even wrote a bachelor thesis.
As a result of years of taking nothing serious, I got kicked out for screwing up my last try for an exam from the 2nd semester. 

In 2012 I lost my driving license due to driving while high and I never bothered to do a 1 year drugscreening with a psychological assessment of my driving capabilities until last year.

After university I got a place in a 3 year apprenticeship with very low pay. My boss knew why I wasn't allowed to drive and he tolerated it for the course of the apprenticeship (since the process of getting back my license costs a shitton of money I didn't have) but after that included me being able to drive as a necessity for the following employment contract.

This was, what finally gave me the incentive to get my shit together. I quit smoking cold turkey, did the drug screening, got my driving license and a car, got a job with a decent starting salary and am looking forward to moving into a house with my girlfriend of 6 years (living together for 3,5 years in a small appartment).

For the first time in my life I feel like a worthy adult and not as a teenaged fuck-up. I could have had all that happiness and security so much earlier if I wasn't stoned all the time. 

During all that process I often read the posts in /leaves to remind me what it felt like, when i relapsed the first couple times and had to start again. Your encouragement of every single one of us struggling might not have been the reason I didn't relapse but it was the reason it was easier to stay strong. Thank you.

Sorry for the huge wall of text but I got carried away.

To all of you still struggling:
In the beginning, quitting weed might be hard, but it gets easier. Slowly at first, but there will come a point at which it gets easier every day. Soon you will hit the point at which you don't miss it anymore. Stay strong."

50 Reasons Why I'm Quitting Weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/6qy0iy/50_reasons_why_im_quitting_weed/,2017-08-01 21:59:31,"Mary Jane, we’ve had some amazing times, but I think it’s time we end things. We’re no good for each other.

I’ve been smoking weed for 3 years consistently and daily for about 2. Throughout this time, I have maintained a semblance of a normal life: going to school, working, and making friends, but I’ve become complacent. I happily wore the stoner title like a badge of honor, proud of the fact that I’d somehow managed to achieve all I had while smoking as much as I did. It took me two years of missed deadlines, broken friendships to realize how backwards that was. Winners justly boast about the hurdles they’ve overcome, but not the ones they’ve laid out for themselves.

I’ve always made my decisions based on pros and cons of the options, and when I started considering dropping weed I realized quickly much weed worked against me. Weed burns holes in your lungs, your clothes, and your memory. Ironically, I would usually realize how little I enjoyed smoking weed when I was high, and those thoughts would fade. But they, unlike so many high thoughts, were rational. So I wrote them down – I made a list. So that even with my clouded memory, I could remember the reasons I need to stop.

At the time of writing, I’ve tried quitting 3 times. The first time I wasn’t committed, and lasted about 5 days. The second time, I tried harder, but got to day 10 before I faltered again. This is my third time, and I’m holding myself to this. I’ve throw out my pipe. I’ve given away my grinder. I’ve shattered my bong and I’ve burnt through all my weed.
 
I need someone to stay committed to. Every day for the next 20 days, I am going to return to this thread and write a comment. I might do more, but I sure as hell won’t do less. This isn’t for attention, this isn’t even really for anyone to see. This is just me finding someone, or something, to be accountable to. Because being accountable for myself isn’t working. I’ll make my first comment tomorrow.

I’ve also attached “50 Reasons I Need to Quit” in no particular order below. Hopefully someone, somewhere, can get something out of this.
 
1.      It makes you lethargic, tired, and lazy.

5.      You don’t follow your dreams anymore

I started smoking to help me like chill out and not be consumed by my overactive mind. Turns out that adding weed to that just adds additional problems and doesn’t help anything. Feeling like shit sober is better than feeling like shit high. Like seriously. When you feel like shit sober there is the possibility of actually taking actions to change your scenario. Once you feel loke shit high you def just gonna feel way worse and trapped and literally not good at all. Just bear down and wait for your dopamine levels to stabilize. I don’t think I’ve ever in my life literally ever have I ever gone “I am glad I was high for that.” So much bs propaganda out about weed pushed by junkies that aren’t honest with themselves and just want everyone to be miserable with them. This drug is shit fucking garbage. Feel like shit sober. Feel the pain. I hate weed so much now. Youre addicted to the compulsion and your idealization of an expected effect that you literally won’t get. I’m so disappointed in myself for falling for this shit for so long.

Today marks 1 year free from weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ggh10t/today_marks_1_year_free_from_weed/,2020-05-09 19:10:17,"I'm going to keep it brief since that other dude has a huge post with some good advice in it. For me, today marks 1 year since I last toked. I have one year free from weed and 100 something days from alcohol and all other drugs.  Weed was my drug of choice but unfortunately for someone like me, I tend to get a little too excited about other substances in its absence so I've cut off everything.

Maybe in time that will change but for today I've never felt better being clean.

I spent a decade smoking obsessively and all it really was in the end, was a giant waste of time. I was a pretty hardcore smoker, but I did it before those carts and stuff came on the market though my friends and I sure did dabs and stuff with a blow torch rig when we could get grams of oil. 

What I've learned during my time in sobriety is that drugs do not make me happy, people make me happy. I am not as much of an isolator as I thought. Connections with people make me happy. It is through those relationships that I find true happiness. 

I used to use 1-2oz a month and thought I could never quit. I've learned a lot of ways not to quit.

What works for me is hanging out with other sober people. I love going to my weekly MA meeting (though I also attend other 12 step fellowship). During those meetings I can see that I'm not alone. I can help other people and by doing that, they help me. We do it together.

I am honest. Honest with myself first and then honest with others. Honesty and fellowship.

Together we can do what I cannot do alone."
My girlfriend broke up with me because I am a piece of shit,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fgemwe/my_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_because_i_am_a/,2020-03-10 18:27:25,"
I am 18 years old and I have been smoking weed everyday since I was 15 years old. Four years ago my family lost everything in a house fire and my dad didn’t handle it well. He became a heavy drinker and it spiraled down quick. In February 2016, my father went into cardiac arrest. I quickly started smoking heavily as a terrible, but easy coping mechanism. Shortly after this my dog Stella was hit by a car and killed. My mom wasn’t handling this well either, and she became a severe alcoholic as well. I wasn’t any better than her, though.

The more and more I smoked, the more and more I set off my problems to the next day. These problems rooted themselves in my brain, manifested my soul and controlled my entire life. Where I was once a joyful, hopeful young man, I turned into a cold, miserable, heartless soul. I was sad all the time, suicidal, would snap at family members over the smallest of disagreements, want to fight my own friends, sleep all day: I had no quality of life.

Then comes along girlfriend. She was amazing. She put up with all my shitty habits, my anger, sleeping all day, and she only wanted to help. She tried to get me to go to counseling, get a doctors appointment and held me when I wanted to cry. Everything she did revolved around making me happy. But I still wasn’t. I still smoked everyday & I put off every bit of advice she gave me. I snapped at her the same way that I snapped before at my mother, my brother, my friends. Because that’s what I do. She deserved nothing but love and respect, and I gave her bullshit. She came over to my dorm yesterday and told me she just couldn’t be with me anymore. She told me she loved me and we hugged and cried for hours. I couldn’t be mad at her, I knew I was terrible. Now, when it’s too late, I just want to scream how sorry I am. I love that girl so much, she was the only thing good in my life.

I felt that getting high was the only thing numbing the pain. I am terrified of the all too familiar darkness that comes with sobering up. But I am ready for that. I have set an alarm for midnight, for at midnight I will no longer be smoking weed. No more nicotine. No more sleeping until 2 P.M., and for gods sake no more fucking excuses. I can’t feel this way anymore. I either have to pick myself up and fight this, or it is going to kill me."
Day 4 after 24 years of heavy use- here are the reasons I quit,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/emannv/day_4_after_24_years_of_heavy_use_here_are_the/,2020-01-09 17:52:09,"These are the reasons I wanted to quit that I listed in my journal while I was still smoking. 

- remember my life. Experience life and then have memory of those experiences

- better relationship w my husband (he couldnt stand that I did it but really and truly he never knew the extent to which I smoked). I've been lying to him for years about it and it just made me feel like such a bad person. 

- save several hundred dollars a month

- can plan a trip anywhere and not worry about how I would bring pot or get it there 

- my health- my cough, my lungs

- no regrets when I'm on my death bed

- won't get munchies and eat shitty food 

- will be more articulate at work. My company deserves better. They treat me so amazingly and I've been high the whole time 

- take control of my life and not the other way around

- no more risk of driving w it 

- no more having to go to my drug dealer. Nice guy but ugh I hated having to go

- actually feeling my emotions

- wrinkles. I'm 41 so smoking only makes you look older. Period. 

- all the hiding. I smoke everywhere I go. Cant tell you how many places that I've snuck in my cart,  went to the bathroom and was getting high as a kite w no one the wiser 

- the smell. I love the smell don't get me wrong but I hated how it stuck to me and could get me caught if the wrong person smelled it.

- better memory. I have 3 college degrees (got all 3 being high as a kite ugh) but I don't remember shit so when people talk about intellectual things I say ""yeah I think yada, yada,  yada."" because I don't freaking remember even though I know I've learned or experienced what they are talking about

Beginning of day 4 for me  I'm actually feeling really good. Bad night sweats, and lots of boredom but I've been getting mentally prepared for the worst so I'm just taking it hour by hour. Day by day. 

This sub is what has 100% helped me make this decision. And at this point it is exactly that- a decision I'm making. 

One thing I'm so grateful for is that I'm making this decision and it's not being forced on me by my job, husband, or the law (I live in an illegal state).

A week clean and something occurred to me,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/egcq5s/a_week_clean_and_something_occurred_to_me/,2019-12-27 18:51:00,"Hi everyone, I haven’t smoked anything the past week and I feel neither happy or disappointed about it. It just is. What struck me more though is that I’ve been battling and trying to quit since about April. Sometimes I’d go as much as a month without smoking and think to myself, “okay I’ve got it all under control, then I’d light up and have to start all over again.

I listened to podcasts on my drive to and from work. I was listening to one where a navy SEAL and green beret were talking and more specifically they were talking about community. The green beret said that after he left the army he went through a real hard track in his life as he didn’t have a mission or real purpose. He said the army teaches that if you have even just one person, a community of two, you can cover 360 degrees. If you’re by yourself though you’re always leaving blind spots.

It just clicked as soon as he said it. I’ve got friends and people I hang out with regularly. I’m not some loner, but I don’t know anyone that would really understand this or what I’m going through. In a way, I still feel alone because people wouldn’t be able to relate or really understand. Then I realized that I’ve been doing this wrong and that if I want to better myself and stay on the path, then I need to reach out to this community. To all of you wonderful people.

None of us are alone. Stay strong. Thank you for reading.

Edit: Thanks for the silver!"

"3 months off weed and cigarettes : anxiety / mild depression kicks in, still.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/c6bq7i/3_months_off_weed_and_cigarettes_anxiety_mild/,2019-06-28 02:03:00,"University professor, at my early 50’s, quitting weed and cigarettes after 30 years. Approaching 3 months off both, no relapse.

The good things;
- mental clarity
- energy and strength 
- waking up easily in the mornings 
- lungs, throat, breathing, MUCH better already
- no weight gain 
- no bipolar behavior (from lying in bed till afternoon and feeling hopeless, to working like crazy and feeling like a semi-god)
- no severe cravings, after month 2.

The bad things:
- a periodic anxiety (comes every week / two weeks, stays for some days, leaves), triggered by anxious dreams, starting in the morning. If it stays more than a couple of days, triggers a mild depression. Makes me not wanting to work / avoiding decisions / feeling overwhelmed. But, it goes away when I just stay in bed, relaxing (the period helps).
- procrastination. Was there with the weed, too, but now I do not have the weapon of getting high, to battle. Result: less work drive, lower self-esteem.
- anhedonia: less sex drive, less drive for playing music or hanging out with friends (the last two I avoid as they were weed-connected). A feeling of boredom, of missing the “high”. 

The aids:
- exercise (2-3 hours a week, plus 3 km a day walking away the dog). 
- meditation (daily, 10 - 20 minutes headspace)
- reading (non fiction, literature, Reddit, 1-3 hours per day)
- eating with caution / drinking with caution
- traveling, when not too down. 
- supportive spouse 
- therapy (monthly)
- a couple of very close friends /ex weed users, too
- telling people about it (to close ones about quitting weed, to the rest about quitting smoking) - creates some “space”, justifies a “leave me alone, I suffer”attitude .

No meds, no nicotine, no cannabis.

Despite the struggles, I feel determined.

Any suggestion welcome !"

Needed it to sleep, needed it to be normal, essentially needed it to function in what i thought was everyday life. When I first quit I used this and other forums for support so though I would come in now. 

If I was trying to quit during this time where, for a lot of people, you are being given time off work then I would have made up alot of excuses to pick up.

Weed made up my life for years and it took a lot of effort to pack it in. When I first quit I couldn't imagine life with out it and thought about it every minute

This is the first time I've thought about it in years.

I've gone from some one who needed it to function to having a fleeting thought about it because I've been on full pay for 2 months and no work to do, and old stoner buddies in the same position reconnecting with me.

It doesn't matter how much you think it's part of you, and part of your life, you can leave it behind you too."
"Weed taught me compassion, now I must take the lesson and give myself compassion without weed",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d2mrzi/weed_taught_me_compassion_now_i_must_take_the/,2019-09-11 12:13:47,"Like a lot of us, I had very critical parents growing up. That voice in my head, the critical voice, is rooted in ""being a good person"", however it is ineffective and very painful. 

I smoked for 15 years, getting up to 2g a day. Throughout this time I tried to quit, but also I learned many things. What weed was teaching me, was to be self-compassionate to myself. It was giving me the ability to hug myself when I needed to hug myself. When all else seemed lost, weed would remind me to love myself.

However - as we find out - relying on an external drug to do this is not sustainable and creates an addiction - we become addicted to ""loving ourselves"" with weed. And, often it does not solve the true problem at hand.

The path to maturity, I have found, is to practice self-compassion and compassion for others, WITHOUT needing weed. I am currently on day 18 (much thanks to the ""Quit Weed"" app).

This idea of self-compassion helps me to turn my time of using weed into a life lesson, and one that I can benefit going forward. I'm not going to lie, yesterday was a very tough day - but today I am glad that I abstained.

It is VERY hard during the withdrawal phase to see any positivity and to practice the self-compassion that was being practiced through taking of the drug. BUT - if you give yourself space, give yourself time, and work to love yourself - step by step, piece by piece, things start to come into focus.

The moral of the story is: we want to love ourselves, and our brains trick us into our habit of weed to justify that. The brain is not wrong that we need love for ourselves, but it is wrong in the mechanism. We must find other ways to love ourselves.

Detoxing, is loving yourself. When you are ready. 

Thanks for reading, and much strength to you in your own journey."

I smoked for 17 Years Daily multiple times a day. 8 Days of no Marijuana.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/brhhx0/i_smoked_for_17_years_daily_multiple_times_a_day/,2019-05-22 03:30:40,"Hey, I am so glad I found this reddit.  I have been reading through all of your posts and can't help but smile and tear up a bit because it's exactly what I feel is needed for anyone considering or actively quitting to smoke pot.

Like the Title says, I smoked daily multiple times a day for 17 years.  I am now on day 8 of 100% no intake of weed.  That first night, you know I was looking for rug nugs on the ground, in the cushions, wherever I thought I'd find a little puff.  Luckily for me, it was a failed search.  (I say lucky now, but at the time I was PISSED)

After a week I can safely say my dreams are insanely vivid.  I have been able to dream in color, remember my dreams, the detail is better than I can actually remember my dreams ever being.  The hard part is getting to sleep and eating, but when I get into bed I actually smile thinking this dream is probably going to blow my mind!  The hardest part for me is, I don't have much going on in my life at the moment so my daily habits are very similar to what they were before.  I chill at my computer and instead of playing games most of the time, I end up watching documentaries (and actually remembering more than snippets), reading up on stuff that's interested me such as sailing and going to the library to find more information on Sailing.  (I've never sailed before in my life and the ocean terrifies me, but I want to do it some day)

Day 1-5 - The most Frustrated I've been mentally in a long time.  I have been rude to my family and snapped over menial things.  I explained to them why I am snapping, but that doesn't justify me being a jerk.  I will have to apologize again and again, hoping for their forgiveness over time.  The physical difference I've noticed during those first five days would be; My brain is functioning differently.  Things that interested me before when I was high, are boring as hell.  I loved gaming but during those days, I would get on a game and stare the screen, maybe join in and be bored after 4 minutes.  It wasn't the same without weed.  I was thinking how the hell can people play games sober all the time?  Insanity! I explained to my close friends from online communities (10+ years of friendship) that I needed to change myself to improve who I was in life.  I feel so unsuccessful spending as much money as I did on pot, instead of saving it.  I think money is a really smart thing to think about when you consider smoking.  Even if you don't spend a lot, write down how much you would be spending and add it up.  It's kind of gross how much I personally was spending on weed and not saving for my future self.  That sum really wakes me up and gives me hope.

&#x200B;

Day 5-7- I Still was frustrated but some things were really becoming enjoyable again.  Being around other people was one of the best things I could have done, especially if they know what you are trying to do.  I say that because some of my friends still smoke, so I explained to them to refrain from mentioning it, telling me about it, just anything that would make me think about it.  (obviously I knew they were smoking but the not talking about it like we normally would is a good change for the person trying to quit).  It sounds cliche but it really is very important to share the information to the people you surround yourself with, because they will help you if they are your friends!  I have received NOTHING but support from these people, so I suggest being open with your close friends as well.  These were the days I just thought, smoking would be so nice right now but I have never been this distanced from smoking before I started years ago.

&#x200B;

Day 8- I am willingly writing about what's going on for me because guess what, it helps!  Talk to people about what you're going through and explain the frustrations.  They will listen and maybe even give you some advice or suggestions to stay busy.  That's key, staying busy!  I am fortunate to have an amazing dog that loves to go on walks (more than me) and that might be the best thing to break a sweat and change the scenery.

My advice for the annoying feelings that come with refraining from smoking - Hot Showers.  If possible crank it to as hot as you physically can tolerate.  The smell of soap and shampoo mixed with the steam just feels amazing and calming.  If you are extremely frustrated or anxious, get in a HOT shower!  Maybe go for a walk before hand to combine exercise and the steam for an even more effective treatment.  I don't know what this post will do other than help me get my thoughts out to others who may be in a similar situation.  I promise you during the first few days I was incapable of writing up this much and not wanting to smash my screen out of boredom.  I still feel slightly bored, but I realize each day I go without smoking, is another day closer to clarity.  Those dreams though! They are a phenomenal experience and I really think even if you aren't going to stop smoking, distance smoking and sleeping to experience it yourself.

Here's Olive who has helped me immensely by keeping me busy!  Instead of buying pot, go adopt a dog! (still less expensive than smoking daily)

A single mishap doesn’t mean I should just go back to daily smoking like I was. None of us are perfect and sobriety isn’t a perfect process either!

He told me, ‘You will get the urge again, sooner or later, and it won’t even be under stressful circumstances, it will just pop out of nowhere and when that happens, because, it will, find something else to do.’ So, ok that.  
I mentioned that my sleep patterns are messed up, and my weird dreams were, well, weird, and unpleasant to say the least, he explained that my brain is trying to rewire itself from years of having to work alongside of chemicals, to be patient it will figure it out, no comments on decoding the dreams, they are just your brain working things out, could be something you saw, ate, heard, it’s just our subconscious processing, and if you’ve been suppressing things as long as I have via weed, it’s possible that it’s going back along way, it will pass.
He mentioned that because I’ve been self medicating all these years, it’s possible that i could find that I have issues that I didn’t realize, ie depression or anxiety, to name a couple of many, and that if that’s the case, then seek help from a professional, to manage it responsibly.  
(If anyone is suffering from depression, or other mental illness, I recommend checking out ‘the bloggess’ aka Jenny Lawson, she owns her mental illnesses so hard, and she is funny as hell and you will find a tribe that lets you know you’re not alone) 
ok back to the Docs input:
To date, there is no irrefutable evidence that smoking pot permanently damages your brain the way alcohol does, with time, and patience, your brain should be functioning just fine, he said in my case, at least 3-6 months, which I find amazing and encouraging.
It’s a good idea to start challenging your brain, not with stupid word games, he said, but with something that interests you, reading literature, learn a language, exercise your brain, your memory will return. 
Again, he mentioned be patient and stay strong. 
He took X-rays of my lungs because I never feel like I get a good satisfying deep breath, there is nothing conclusive, they are a little bit enlarged which could indicate COPD but we agreed that I would try and exercise a little harder than I have been so I really force myself to breathe heavily, and see if in a few months, they don’t feel better. If not, we can do more tests. 
So, for all y’all out there freaking out that you fried your brains or worse, I hear you, but take heart, it’s all reversible, but you need to stay strong, stay disciplined, stay focused on the rest of your life, good night and good luck!
Also, y’all are amazing, I look at the posts and  positive kind people that respond to those who reach out and I realize we come from all over the world, we are a tribe, of good people, who have so much empathy and there’s so many of us, from all walks of life, with a common goal that unites us: we want to be better, we want to do better, and it gives me hope, that the world isn’t completely filled with assholes. So thanks for that, everyone! Love and light to you all 💋"

3 months!!! Congratulate me please!! plus: the good & the bad,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gmjysw/3_months_congratulate_me_please_plus_the_good_the/,2020-05-19 11:32:36,"I hit 3 months a couple days ago and I wanted to make a post about my experience. This sub has been huge for me. This is the longest I've gone without weed (by far) in 5 years. The first month was hard, the second month was much easier, and the third month was kinda hard again so I'm really proud that I haven't relapsed.

The good:

* Bags under my eyes have disappeared! It took like 2 months but wow it's really true! It's crazy to think I didn't get a good night's sleep (with REM) for 5 years.
* Joy, creativity, hunger, sleepiness; these things come up naturally now, rather than needing to be smoke-induced every time. At first weed amplifies these things but with regular use it becomes the only way to experience them.
* I'm taking care of my teeth regularly.
* I watched the new Rick & Morty episodes without getting high; I don't think I've ever watched the show sober before but it was still really funny and I think it was easier to follow the story. It's freeing to not feel like I have to be high before I can watch a TV show or play a game.
* Short term memory is improved.
* Re-connected with friends/family members who don't smoke weed. It's easier to have spontaneous conversations and I feel like people are generally reacting to me better.
* Taking more walks during the day in pretty public parks enjoying the sun and people walking their dogs, rather than only at night to smoke in private.
* I feel more like myself; like who I was when I was young/before weed.

The bad:

So, for the reason you already know, this month I've been really depressed and struggling with daily functions. I had a week where I slept for 16+ hours every day. I started to think ""If I'm just sleeping and eating anyway, why don't I smoke?"" I made a post here about it and got some good support. Then hitting 3 months was kind of triggering; I felt like ""Haven't I proved enough? Isn't once every 3 months OK?""

I started thinking about weed a lot again, talking myself into relapsing and then talking myself out of it. That's the part of I'm sick of, thinking about weed all the time and letting it control my daily schedule.

I finally realized two things: one, what I remember about weed (the good times) isn't what I'll experience if I'm smoke again (I'll just be anxious and tired). Two, if I smoke once I'll be thinking about weed every day for like another month, and I really don't want that. So, I think I've accepted that 3 months is not an excuse to relapse. The urges are diminishing (for now at least).

OK, that's it. Thank you for reading. You can do this and it's so worth it!!!"

Weed and smoking always allowed me to 'shrink' my world. To ignore external pressures, obligations, and irritations. My world went no further than me and my drug. This made it easily controllable and very comfortable.

As proven by the existence of this sub, weed is not a panacea, but it feels that way when you are so deeply enthralled by it. The easy, confrontationaless world I lived in was bliss, and I never needed to face any difficult reality while I was there.

Trouble is, when you quit, that world quickly begins to fade like the façade it is, and illuminates all the corners of life I had shut myself away from so willingly.

Replace that bad habit with good ones like exercise and meditation.if anyone needs any advice feel free to pm me or comment here. Have a good day everyone"

"For the lurkers, the dreamers, the smokers, the leavers",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cymjkg/for_the_lurkers_the_dreamers_the_smokers_the/,2019-09-02 12:58:34,"I’ve been lurking this subreddit on and off for several months and I’d like to share my thoughts with you.

Let me tell you my story in a relatable and, perhaps, meaningful way. 

At first, I began smoking weed very rarely during social parties. I enjoyed it. It was euphoric. It was new. I entered a new perspective on myself whereby I felt I was carrying an internal conversation that helped discover new things about myself. 

Then I started smoking more frequently. Now the experience was still very enjoyable, but I was beginning to not enjoy experiences without it. However, I still continued to be a productive, relatively successful individual (respected occupation, fancy apartment, etc.). 

Then I started the vape pens. Those euphoric highs were extraordinary. I felt I was solving all the world’s problems in my head and then some. 

Then those close to me suspected I was on something because my personality had changed. Although I felt it hadn’t, they remarked that I was less connected and more dull. I had lost an edge that defined me. 

So I quit. 

Several times. 

First a couple of days. Then a week. Then a couple of days. And so on. 

It’s now been 30 days. 

I’ll tell you what’s happened. 

I’ve got my edge back. I’m sharper. More focused. I’m no longer escaping boredom, anxiety, or stress. I’m tackling them head on. I’m working out, losing weight, and studying again. It’s no coincidence. 

Most importantly, it’s not the streak of days that I’m no longer high that matters, but the streak of days that I am consistently myself. 

I post this because this story will be true for almost all of you. I wish you the best. Be your best. You owe it to you. The high is a lie."

My mood is entirely dependent if I have bud, it could be the worst of the worst bud and I would still find comfort in the fact I have something to chop up. I can not imagine a life without smoking bongs. I hate myself for not just being able to drop this substance. I have developed permanent hand tremors from the abuse, and if I go two days I skitz out with anger at small things and my anxiety is at an all time high. But funny thing is, the moment I smoke my anxiety also goes through the roof, I can leave my house whatsoever out of fear of something terrible happening. I want to quit it so I don’t fear the world anymore, but everything terrifies me when I’m off it.

It would lead to me wanted to sneak a little tobacco in that J to make a nice spliff, one of my brains favorite chemicals.

I would start eating worse, letting go of hobbies just to sit around and be high, everyday chores would be way more obnoxious because Im not stoned, my relationship with my gf would struggle because someone so amazing should never take a backseat to weed :(

8 Months Sober - Here's What I've Learned,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dbg2ms/8_months_sober_heres_what_ive_learned/,2019-09-30 22:39:16,"This is a long post, so I'm going to use bolding and TLDR's for the long sections to help make it more digestible. The sections are Intro, What I've Gained, What I've Lost, How I Did It, and TLDR.

**Intro:** I smoked daily for 8 years and struggled trying to quit from November 2016 to January 2019. It took me nearly 3 years to get 8 months sober. I swear if I can do it, you can do it too.

This community was soooo valuable in helping me quit, so I wanted to finally come back and share my experience. I hope you find it helpful.

**What I've Gained:** 

* Mental clarity
* Confidence 
* Self love
* Interacting with people is so much easier 
* I’m happier and more connected to the good parts of my life 
* Better relationships with my family and friends 
* I have more time 
* Less stress 
* Less sensitive/easily hurt
* More empathy
* Stable moods 
* The ability to face my negative emotions and hear what they need to tell me 
* The ability to face my positive emotions and truly experience them
* I can identify other problems in my life that need addressing 
* Sustained focus on developing myself, instead of trying things and not sticking with them 
* Better self-control 
* Better sleep
* More desire to socialize, less craving to self-isolate 

**TLDR: life is so much better and easier.** Not always easy, and not always great, but 8 months in, everything in my life has and continues to improve.

**What I've Lost:** Let's be honest, we wouldn't be here if we didn't love weed. We're the ones who love it too much. We love it so much we have to take it away from ourselves. So yeah, giving it up, there's going to be some loss.

For *years* I struggled with the idea of quitting \*forever\*. We've all experienced the fun, and, I believe genuinely beneficial aspects of getting stoned. 

**My hang-up in quitting/What I thought I'd really miss:** 

* Introspection and self-revelation 
* Awe-inspiring experiences with music, movies, and video games 
* Helping me get excited about my life 
* Do I really have to quit FOREVER?

Where am I at now?

**Introspection and self-revelation:** All that good stuff that bubbles up (usually only in like the first half hour) when you're high is actually bubbling up all the time. Smoking weed can send a lot of it up at once, and it makes you more interested, because your thoughts feel more profound, but you'll still have these realizations and insights into your life while sober, and your ability to integrate them increases greatly. I still miss this a bit, but nbd.

**Music, video games, movies:** I love that feeling of wonder, when you're singularly immersed in something. Some of my experiences with weed and music, movies, and video games were truly transcendent. But far, far more of my experiences  were desperately grasping for the feeling of wonder, not finding it, and ending up sorely disappointed.

That feeling of wonder comes from presence. Being fully present, and fully experiencing something. The good parts of being high did that to me. Gave me singular focus, plus a blast of feel-good chemicals. So where is the wonder? Is it in weed? No! It's within you. 

I find that singular focus and wonder in so many more things now. Music, movies, and video games still, for sure, but also in much quieter moments, just taking in my surroundings. The wonder is within us and without us, not in a bowl and a tv screen. Weed could help force that feeling. It could also make you grasp desperately at it for hours on end. Let it come to you.

**Getting excited about my life:** This is the one that's still hanging around. Weed has the ability, mostly before you totally abuse it, to take a random Tuesday night and make it feel exciting and special. To make me want to get on my computer and make a song, or excited to eat dinner, excited about whatever. I do find that excitement naturally, but honestly I do still miss being able to bottle that excitement and crack it open when I'm feeling sort of an ennui. That bottle came with a price, though, which is feeling wholly unmotivated and like you just can't even - and I do try to appreciate not paying that price. I tend to trust that my excitement for life will continue to improve over time.

**Quitting forever:** I don't think about it as much. Sure, it's possible I could have a healthy relationship with weed some day. I think like any drug, there's a type of usage where it can enhance your life at minimal cost. I abused alcohol in my late teen years, and for many years now I've had no problem enhancing my life with a drink or two with friends like once a month, without paying the cost of a hangover or full loss of faculties. 

It's possible I could get there with weed. But I don't worry about it as much these days. I haven't lost as much as I've thought I would, and I've gained so much. I want to protect that.

**TLDR: The things you'll miss about weed are an inherent part of life.** You come by all that good stuff far more often living clean and sober - it's just distributed more evenly throughout your life instead of concentrated into that perfect smoke sesh we've all been chasing.

**How I did it:**

I'll give a full list of things that helped, and then focus specifically on the things that were different this time that I actually quit, after years of struggling:

* Meditation
* Therapy
* Exercise
* Healthy Diet
* Reading r/Leaves
* Keep Trying

I did these things for years and never made it past 2 months. So what changed? Well a few things:

**Make an emergency plan:** By far the most important thing here. What's the difference between re-lapse and 8 months sober? Surviving a few of the strongest urges I've ever had to smoke. In 243 days sober, probably 230 of them were easy as pie, maybe 10 required some conviction, and 3 were borderline miraculous I didn't smoke.

I got so close to smoking those 3 days. What saved me? Knowing I'd face insanely strong urges, making a plan for when that happened, and following my plan. 

Whenever I got to the point where I was about to give up and smoke, I got on r/Leaves and read. I read and read, still thinking I was going to smoke, but instead of smoking I read. Eventually I'd stumble onto something that gave me the strength not to smoke, and I knew I'd made it past that craving. **This is what got me to 8 months sober. That was my plan. Make your own.**

**Re-commit to being sober every day, and give a reason it's important:** I started out hand-writing my commitment in a notebook every morning, and I did that for a month or two. Eventually I found the I am Sober app, and started doing it there, too, and eventually started doing just the app. I still do the app. Renew your commitment every day. Keep it strong.

**Talk about it with your friends:** My weed usage was such a shameful thing for me, and I kept it hidden for so long. Share your struggles with people - there's so much connection to be found in our shared struggles. People say the opposite of addiction is connection, and that feels true to me. Connect with others on this topic, connect with others in general, and don't be afraid to show this side of yourself. Just tread lightly at first, some people won't be ready to talk about it if they aren't ready to look at some related part of themselves.

**Call it what it is:** This has always been hard for me, but here it goes. I'm addicted to weed. My dad is an alcoholic, his dad was an alcoholic, my mom's dad was an alcoholic, and I'm addicted to weed. I had to realize it wasn't one bowl or one evening with nothing going on - it was addiction. One random night is no big deal, but addiction is a huge deal, and I had to re-frame and face up to it to deal with it.

**Mantras:** Any time I saw craving thoughts (thank you meditation for helping me see these) I would repeat a mantra for myself in response. I had a few, but one was ""I am an alcoholic, as was my father, as was his father before him."" It helped stop or slow that runaway train that starts with one random thought and leads to picking up pizza after work and getting super duper stoned.

**TLDR: Life is great sober.** Everything you love about getting high is still here, but better, and easier. If you're struggling, stay strong, love yourself, and keep on struggling. Make yourself a plan to beat this thing. You're worth it and the struggle is worth it. Read r/Leaves. It helps. Much love"

Everything you have all said has been incredibly helpful, and just knowing that there are a bunch of people I've never met who give enough of a damn to comment and help a random stranger really helps -- the commonality and shared experience especially.  I was afraid, as a mid 40s dude having a rough time with this that I'd be an outlier.  I'm glad I'm not.  Just knowing it's going to clear up eventually makes it easier to suck up how it feels now.

I smoked for over ten years. That’s six figures. Up in smoke.

I have this image in my head of what getting high will feel like. I really want it; but I know it's total bull. Quitting is a mourning process.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d2hfc8/i_have_this_image_in_my_head_of_what_getting_high/,2019-09-11 04:24:37,"When I think about getting high, I feel the exact same memory. Everything slows down, everything is so bright, my vision fishbowls back a little, I feel like my chest is rising a bit and I can't help but giggle. This is what getting high used to feel like for me, and it was very nice.

Everytime I've slipped up, it's been this tempting image that has caused it. Everytime I've slipped up, that has NOT been what happened. Not for a long time. Whenever I get high now, I feel shivery, anxious, dried out, tired. Panic attack and isolation. Huge regret.

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that correlates with our expectation of something good. Because weed is pretty much universally amazing when people start out, dopamine is naturally released when a smoker thinks about getting high. Even as the high starts to fade and suck everytime, the dopamine level is still high, making you expect that THIS TIME it will be fine.

I believe quitting smoking is a mourning process. Someone who has never been drug dependent/addicted would find that silly. But the truth is, addiction is connection to a substance to make up for a lack of real connection with others and the real world. Many of the same brain chemicals that make you love a person, and make you grieve when they are gone, are activated when you take a toke. Losing weed can be like losing a friend or a partner, as is evidenced by the way so many people personify marijuana when they say goodbye. 

What's tragic about addiction is that sometimes it can be even more confusing to accept than when your friend has died. If someone you love dies, that's very hard, but you also know that you can't change what has happened. When quitting smoking, you could theoretically bring Mary J back to life by relapsing. And then you have to watch her die again when you inevitably choose to quit once again. Rinse and repeat.

The good news about all this: quitting will almost guarantee you connect better with people around you. You can get long lasting, free, genuine natural highs and build up strong, helpful, healthy relationships at the exact same time. Really consider this. Is weed better than that? No. It's just easier and more comfortable. Dare to be brave.

This is a call to everyone thinking about smoking: Don't put yourself through that process over and over. Just mourn and watch as it gets easier. Humans are better at moving on from the loss of a friend or lover than you think, and the same will be true for quitting. Just have faith in yourself.

"Anyone else constantly feel you'd be better off stoned when you're sober, and sober when you're stoned?",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7xbveq/anyone_else_constantly_feel_youd_be_better_off/,2018-02-13 22:21:10,"I'm just curious if anyone else struggles with something similar to this.

When I haven't been smoking I get anxious, overwhelmed, and have trouble doing things like sleeping, exercising regularly, and just generally relaxing and finding the beauty in the little things in my life. 

I occasionally reach a tipping point and buy some weed, and for while I experience a happy medium between the coherence of sobriety and the pleasure of enjoying my drug of choice. 

But usually within a week my self-control has lapsed to the point where I'm smoking multiple times a day, starting earlier and earlier in the day. It interferes with the things I want to get done; things as basic as holding a conversation on track and not losing my train of thought. I reach another tipping point here where I throw out the weed I have left, go cold turkey, and get my shit back together.

Theeenn a while later a stressful event or the accumulation of little things will convince me that I'd be so much happier and effective in the things I want to get done if I could just take the edge off once in a while with some weed. Cue the continuation of the cycle.

Anyone else have this kind of thing happen? If so, what are your go-to strategies to get out of this loop?

My final conclusion for you all: 

It was never the weed's fault. I still like weed. I appreciate the fun we had. I appreciate the friends I have made smoking together. But I **allow myself** to become complacent when I am high. I settle for less, and let myself think ""this is enough"". 

Success and personal growth are my new high. Thanks to recent clarity, I have doubled my income, got in great shape, and separated from the toxic people and behaviors that used to dominate my life. 

And who knows...
maybe one day down the road, I will be able to roll one up again under better circumstances when the time is right.

I managed to stay sober for 2 months and just wanted to tell you what has changed since I quit. 

* I get sooo much more shit done. In my job, for example. When I smoked, I finished 1 or 2 tasks a week. Now I finish 5+ tasks easily. 
* I'm a much better partner to my girlfriend. Just an example: When I smoked, it was usually her who made dinner while I sat on the couch smoking and playing video games. Now we cook together or I do it while she can relax on the couch and I love it. (And she loves it.)
* I'm a much better friend to my friends. Before, when my friends went out to a bar, I usually stayed at home because I would rather be alone and smoke. Now I really like going out with them. In the first days after quitting I was afraid I would not like going out without weed, but I quickly realized that it's not hard at all. 
* I'm a much better son and brother to my family. When I smoked, I called my parents and siblings (I live across the country) maybe twice a month, sometimes less. Now I call them almost daily. 
* I'm in way better shape. When I smoked, my lungs started to hurt after 2 minutes on my bike, now they don't hurt at all. Also I really feel like doing something for my body (work out, go for a run etc.) When I smoked I didn't really care.
* I look better. I noticed that my eyes and teeth are cleaner and a lot of people told me I look „fresh“, woohoo!
* I drink less alcohol. I thought I would be drinking more in order to compensate the missing weed flash, but surprisingly I don't. 
* As I said in the title, I realized (even long before quitting) that I don't like being high, I only like the idea of being high. When I imagined lighting up a joint it seemed so cool and relaxing and even kinda romantic, but when I actually did it, it just felt like feeding my addiction.

For me, the only hard part were the first two days. After that, it became waaay easier. So if you're waiting for a sign: Here it is. Do it. It's worth it."
A little trick that I use regularly to help with cravings (5 months clean).,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/c4hdyy/a_little_trick_that_i_use_regularly_to_help_with/,2019-06-24 07:02:58,"""No, we don't do that anymore.""  


When my brain pops up and says ""Hey! let's smoke some weed!"" which is still somewhat frequent, I acknowledge that a certain part of me really wants to get high, but then treat it like a 5 year old who wants to eat ice-cream for breakfast.  I know he doesn't understand all the reasons why he can't have what he wants, so I keep it simple: ""No, we don't do that anymore."" We used to, but we don't anymore. Full stop.  Something about this mentality helps me let go of the craving, even if it's like a 5 year old saying ""Aw man! That sucks!""  That's right, 5 year old brain. That does suck. And also it's not happening, so move on.  Somehow, I move on every single time.  


The point is. Cravings are gonna show up. Remember that you are the adult here and that there are plenty of good reasons not to smoke, even if a certain part of you can't remember all of them. Make a hard rule and then make a part of you enforce it when the rest of you would rather not.  There's a ton of other techniques that I use to stay clean, but honestly, repeating the phrase ""We don't do that anymore"" seems to be the one that I use the most these days.  I recently quit nicotine, which is its own terrible addiction, and it's working for that too."

The reason why you can't even smoke one hit - 16 days free,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fvad2j/the_reason_why_you_cant_even_smoke_one_hit_16/,2020-04-05 12:10:59,"What usually happens is that after a few weeks of not smoking weed, you start to feel confident again.

You don't feel cravings anymore, and you're forgetting how strong was weed's grip on your life.

You think to yourself that it is only one time, and what could go wrong?

&nbsp;

What people usually don't understand in this situation is that even after a few weeks or even a few months without using, your brain is still not the same as a non-smoker.

Your brain is the same as past user. And as past user, your brain still has strong connections between weed and happiness.

This is what caused your cravings, and when you give your brain THC once again after so long - you wake up all these strong connections that you have tried so hard to ignore.

Your brain's craving to THC will be once again full blown. You will no longer be able to concentrate on anything other than smoking weed again.

It takes weeks untill the intense feeling of craving weed will be manageable again.

&nbsp;

This is usually what makes people relapse most of the time.
I know from experience that my last 3 attempts to quit weed failed exactly because of that - confidence that came after a few weeks which lead to one hit.

And after that one hit you get back that need so bad that you start abusing weed again extremely fast.

&nbsp;

I believe that understanding this is the key to make my current attempt successful.

I am 16 days in, the cravings had stopped. I know that if I will smoke only once in about 6 months, maybe even in a year, the cravings that it will cause will be unbearable.

Rewiring your brain to not like weed hat much takes lots of TIME.

I am not going to risk it all anywhere in the near future - it simply does not worth it.

Hope that this information will help you too!"

i looked for you all the time. i longed for you every night. i missed you all the time. but you were always there! you were never too busy, or too important, or too complicated. my silent confidante. my trusted friend. you never left me. you never made me cry, and when you did, you were there to make it better. you never spoke but i knew you listened. you were my flame in a world of darkness. and just for a little while, you made me forget the loneliness that cannot be touched.


but we were selfish, you wanted me all to yourself. i wanted you to myself. you liked being alone with me. and i liked being alone with you. so much so that i found after a while i had fallen in love with you. and that was a time. until i found that life and others had passed me by because of it. nothing waits.


and it is with nothing but misery that you too made me realise all of this and that as lovely and loyal as you might be, i must go now and leave you behind or this fire’s gonna catch us both."
"After 8 years of daily use, a diagnosis of Cannabis Use Disorder, I guess I'm ready to change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/faiktn/after_8_years_of_daily_use_a_diagnosis_of/,2020-02-27 23:43:13,"Hi, I'm Glo, and I'm addicted to THC.

I started smoking weed as a teen with friends, sometimes skipping school to get high, but not often.  Then I got to college.  I started smoking more often, at least once or twice a week, still just with friends though.  Then came moving into my first apartment (shared with roommates) and all the freedom of living away from parents and off of school property.  I got myself my very own bong that year... and that's when everything started to change.

I began smoking daily, after work at first, then eventually in the morning before breakfast but hours before my nighttime work shifts.  When I was 22 I met my ex, D\*, and fell in love hard and fast.  He smelled of cannabis and coffee (we worked at starbucks together) and I loved it.  He was a weed dealer (back in the days before dispensaries were standard in Toronto) and smoked daily as well.  I was always high when we were together.  I started smoking at all times of day regardless of when I worked, and being high became my normal.

Two years later, D\* broke my heart, and I didn't want to feel anything.  I started smoking much higher THC levels and more often, I relied heavily on cannabis to numb my negative emotions. These emotions of mine are very intense, as I have Borderline Personality Depression and ADHD.  Being high made me less reactionary, less anxious, more... comfortable.

It's been 3 years since that breakup and despite multiple attempts at ""cutting back"" ""lowering my usage"" or ""quitting"".. I haven't been successful.

I am dependent. I spend all my time thinking about the next chance I'll have to smoke, I don't socialize unless I can be high, I don't allow myself to run out of weed even if it means going without groceries. I am terrified of the idea that I should quit for good and forever, but I know I can't go on like this.

I'm lonely. I'm lethargic. My memory is hard to access. I've no motivation to do anything other than smoking weed. I'm late for work often (a job I love!) because I just can't motivate myself to be on time for anything ever.  I've gained a LOT of weight and never have enough energy to exercise.  I'm numb and haven't cried in over a year despite experiencing sad and even traumatic events in that time.

I recently had a Psychiatric consult because I thought these struggles were linked to my medications (anti-depressant, mood stabiliser) and wanted to try a different medication for the first time since going on antidepressants. The psychiatric team I consulted with diagnosed me with Cannabis Use Disorder, and explained that due to the amount I've been smoking, every day, for years now, while my brain still developed and while I also struggle with BPD - that it has caused long term effects on my cognitive functions and mood.  They told me that it would be pointless to change my medication without me actually making a change in my cannabis consumption and addressing this addiction.

&#x200B;

So here I am. Going to an Addictions Clinic next Wednesday, looking for support here, and tomorrow night, I am going to go to my first Marijuana Anonymous meeting (very lucky that I live in Toronto and there are options every weekday here)  But I'm scared. I don't know what's coming. I don't know how to accept this new reality.  I don't know what to do to occupy my time as nothing seems to make me as happy as smoking weed does. Nothing calms my mind the way smoking does.

So there's my story, I'm taking the first steps towards quitting, and I'm terrified."
Two years of freedom,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eruntw/two_years_of_freedom/,2020-01-21 16:25:41,"So it’s been almost 2 years of sobriety for me. Maybe my testimony will give someone hope out there. My life has improved to an extent I didn’t foresee. 


Two years ago I was living with my parents, working dead end minimum wage jobs, and saving no money at all. I was failing college, unhealthy, and completely unmotivated. Weed was legitimately the biggest barrier in my life. 


As soon as I quit I finally gained courage and motivation/drive to achieve things. Now I’m in a career I absolutely love, making more money than I even know how to spend, and living on my own with plenty of savings and am in the market about to buy a house by myself. Also, two years ago my main and only hobby was smoking. 

Now I’ve developed an intense passion for music, and am well on my way to learning guitar and piano. I’ve also really seriously fallen in love with fitness, primarily running and weightlifting and I’ve progressed much farther than I would’ve ever imagined I could. 

I could go on, and on about the improvements in life, but most important is that I have a constant level of peace in my heart and I really very very rarely go through bad times anymore. I’m not irritable, and I gain much enjoyment doing things I could have never imagined would’ve given me enjoyment. 

I’ve really fallen in love with life and my mind is immeasurably quicker and sharper. Every day I have an abundance of energy that allows me to very quickly move towards my goals. I know with 110% certainty that weed was my greatest inhibitor because everything started changing right when I freed myself from its grip."
"So I quit smoking weed on accident and I feel great. Been a lurker on this sub with no real intention to stop smoking. Was just nice to relate on some issues and enjoyed the camaraderie. But I would like to share my story, sorry it's a little long...",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ej59pq/so_i_quit_smoking_weed_on_accident_and_i_feel/,2020-01-03 01:14:06,"Like I said I've been a lurker here and I've enjoyed many of your posts and saved a few of them and some comments I found very relatable and helpful. This is my first post or comment. 

I know part of me really just wants to keep smoking and act like it's not a problem. While it may not be the root of all my problems it doesn't help me like it use to. It use to only positively effect me, I was still happy and social even when I was high. It always made my body and mind feel good. It always felt right. That's definitely not the case anymore. Maybe it is the root of my problems. I know it's something I need to consider. 

I have been smoking since highschool and haven't ever stopped, it's been over ten years. That's crazy to think about how much time I've kept the habit up. Also since highschool I've smoked cigarettes, drank beer and liquor, have enjoyed a little share of hallucinogens and some rec drugs and have been able to let go of all of them at some point in my life. I smoked cigarettes since highschool, stopped cold turkey for one and half years and now enjoy one every now and then. I still enjoy a drink every now and then and admit I can go a little heavy when I do but it's not a craving or habitual, I can just drop it unlike weed which I've literally never let go of since I started and if I didn't have it everything sucked and I probably wouldn't feel like doing anything until I found some weed.

Anyway...

My dealer took a week off for the holidays and I didn't get enough to last me until he was open again. Smoked the last I had about a week ago and I was plotting to get some as soon as he was back. He's been back for a few days but I haven't gone to him. I feel great and actually beginning to feel a little proud of myself. I also have an insane amount of energy that's almost annoying haha but it's probably because I don't have anything to put my energy into.

I do want to be honest with everyone here and out of respect for people who actually have quit, I feel like I should admit that I have dry hit my pipe a few times and smoked resin. I don't want to lie and I hope it's alright that I still post this. I can't say enough how much I respect this sub and the people here. You all seem like very understanding and loving people. I'm sorry if what I'm posting isn't what this sub is meant for but I feel like this is the place I could come to and share my experience, and I just want to be one hundred percent honest and transparent. I'm sorry if I am in the wrong and I understand.
Even though I haven't technically stopped, I feel great. Work is better, I feel full of life again and I can express myself with much more ease. I think that's the best part. My wit and humour is strong again! It's great. I absolutely love making people laugh, it's a great natural high, it definitely hits that reward/pleasure spot in my head and it feels great haha

I do suffered from over anxiety and have a had a couple severe panic attacks to the point I thought I was having a seizure. I hope this change will help, it would be nice to be able to go into new social situations or be on an airplane and not worry I'm going shit and vomit all over myself from being anxious haha

Another reason I'm really excited about this change is because the relationship I'm in right now is struggling. I live with my girlfriend which we've done before and ended up going different ways. She also smokes but I feel like she smokes more because I'm around, she's not the best at finding it or amounts and prices. She wouldn't even really try to get any and I know she would honestly love it if I stopped smoking. There's a good chance we go our separate ways again at the end of our lease but I want to do this for the both of us. I know at the end of the day it should be about me and improvment for myself but if we do separate I want to leave each other better than when we got together again. 

I want to be that force of positive action for her. She's had a tough life and she's worked hard to improve it little by little with what she had, which was nothing. She's tired of being disappointed and I know I've contributed to that feeling. She feels like a failure and I want to be able to change that idea that we have failed. I want to be a partner who's ready to live a full life and really share some experiences with each other and not just float/coast through life which is all I've been doing. I want to be a source of positivity, of motivation and I want to inspire her and everyone I come across be their best, to care, to try, to better yourself even in the smallest ways. Push yourself to be that great person you already are. There's nothing you need to add to become a better person, you just need to pull it from within yourself, and become the master of your own seas. I would appreciate any support you have on my journey to mastering the sometimes rough seas and let's help each other to calmer waters.

Thank You for reading

I Appreciate and Love all of You

Edit: Wow. Thank all of you so so much. I'm honestly in tears right now because I have all of you at my back just like that. You are all so amazing. I'll admit for some reason I'm scared to fully commiting to quiting and I think it's because part of me doesn't think I actually can. But what I do know because of all of you is that I am on the right track. Failing is not what I want to do but it happens and we get back up and fight another day. I've always been a fighter but I was honestly at my limit. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for giving me hope and strength again. I will remain a regular here and pass forward the love and support I have gotten from all of you.

 I have a friend who says water is life, life is love and gratitude. So life is two parts gratitude and one part love. H2O. Some hippy shit but thank you, thank you, I love you all.

One last thing, I just commented on another post here about anxiety and I would like to share. It's not really a fight, it shouldn't be a battle. Give your problems space to be. The more space you give them the more clear they become to be. The clearer they are the more you understand yourself and you can tame and even 'conquer' it. But it's not a battle, the more I fought the less I had control over myself. You can't out think your problems. It takes strong will, surrendering to the things you have no power over and action over the ones you do. I've honestly always loved the serenity prayer which is similar even though I'm not religious because it captures that perfectly.

Thanks again everyone, I feel like I'll sleep pretty good tonight even without a smoke. I hope the same for everyone else. 

See you around friends! Peace and love ☺️"

Tommorow i’ve been setup, from an former co-worker, to give my old boss a Call, because they miss me, and the good work i always contributet with, and they’ve heard about my progress!
It’s the best job i’ve ever had, so this is huge for me and my family,, i feel blessed to get a second chance. 

This is my gamechanger, a chance for a Hole new and better life, came a long with quitting once and for all!

Never going back to that shit, it has impacted my life in ways, that i never dreamt of while goofin arround the first couple years of using it!

Stop it, before you go Down the road, with anxiety, depression, lack of sleep, lying for anybody arround you, just to get that next hit, the one you foul the most, is you self!

It’s never and option again, never guys.

I wish you all the best, and keep up the spirit, the better life is waiting for all of you strong leavers!

100 days is a very small investment, in rest of you life.


Best of luck with your journey

The idea of smoking and being high is much better than actually being high.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/69dc2b/the_idea_of_smoking_and_being_high_is_much_better/,2017-05-05 11:45:49,"For those of you still in the process of quitting, I encourage you to try and notice exactly how you feel next time you get high. This has helped me tremendously in realizing that I don't need weed in my life. Next time you smoke, just spend 30 second or a minute just thinking exactly about how you feel right now, and why it something that you enjoy. After many times of examining myself while stoned I realized that it kinda sucks. You're ability to socialize with other people is extremely diminished, your desire to do anything productive is gone, eating healthy foods no longer does it for you, the euphoria the you feel is often very mild and extremely short lasting followed by a tiresome haze, etc. Each person will have their own reasons and need to notice it for themselves. So for anyone out there still trying to quit give this a try."

For me it’s a lifestyle change.  I don’t know how many days it’s been now and don’t really care.  

What’s most important is weed and its negative effects on my life are gone.  I’m focused more on my quality of life now and that has no number."

Don't quit quitting,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fyj2rg/dont_quit_quitting/,2020-04-10 20:27:15,"Hey everyone, I'm a fairly well recovered stoner. I was high pretty much 24/7 for 5 years, from when I was 19 years old. I quit the daily habit in January 2017, with a few minor relapses since. 

This sub is great, and I really love the support here. I wanted to add some personal advice, it may work for you, it may not. If you're struggling I'd encourage you to read ahead. 

Here's the gist of why I managed to quit: it was a fucking *long* process. Quitting for me wasn't a case of just deciding one day to go cold turkey. That flat out did not work for me. Like many of you here, I wanted to quit for a seriously long time before I actually did. I hated myself for ages even though I kept reaching for the green. ""I'll do it tomorrow, I'll finish this bag first, I'll do it after the party on the weekend."" Like having to break up with someone, there was simply never going to be a good time to do it. 

It took a six week trip to Europe for me to hit the reset button, cause I was too chicken shit to buy drugs in a foreign country (except Amsterdam). The sobriety I had was... liberating. Life was so much clearer. It helped that I was on holidays, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to do what I did if you're at home. 

My point is, it's not like everything just changed for me when I quit. I still had my old habits. My addict brain still had cravings (still does, to this very day). And I slipped, more times than I can count. But you know what? Quitting is like any other habit: it gets easier the more you do it. Maybe counting the days works for you, and if it does, I don't want to take that away. But so many of you on this sub seem to obsess on day counting. My advice? Just one day at a time. That's your focus right now. Day 4, day 15, day 57, doesn't matter. What matters is that you're sober today. 

If you slip, you slip. Don't use this as an excuse to smoke tonight. But similarly, don't use it to beat the living piss out of yourself if you relapse either, because I can guarantee you that hating on yourself is the surest and fastest way to impeding your progress. 

TL;DR, quitting ain't a light-switch. It's a muscle. Try hard and try often, and persist in your goal. You'll get there eventually."

I'm taking a stand, today. This isn't the first time I've tried to quit, and I do have a problem. Especially with THC cartridges. I have no self control, but this drug has a grip on me like no other. I've quit cocaine, heroin, and I used to be a heavy MDMA user. But nothing has a hold on me like ol' Mary Jane.

I then left for an hour and when I came back there was a guy smoking a big joint in the living room.

I didn't say anything because he was more of a guest than I was (I often stay at that friend's place), they were both high. Then we had dinner and I was feeling really bad. During that time I felt high without smoking, passive smoke I guess.

Once dinner was over I asked my friend if I could talk to her in private, I was panicking because I have been avoiding situations like these so that I wouldn't be tempted to smoke again.

I told her I had to leave because the situation was really difficult for me, I couldn't cope with it. So I packed my things and left. I felt really bad about it and guilty, like I was a drama queen for leaving like this.. but now that I'm home I feel good that I stood up for myself and didn't stay there.

How to live without weed ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ia7cqx/how_to_live_without_weed/,2020-08-15 17:29:06,"I have been smoking for so long. Im 31 now and started at 15. Pretty much my whole adult life. I have been doing it so long I cannot remember how to live without weed. My whole life has been shaped by it, I need it to have fun and relax but I am also antisocial on it.

I need it to play my guitar, to play pc games, to have deep conversations with myself and others. But nowadays I just dont feel good when I smoke because of anxiety. Its so scary to quit because I dont know what I would do without it but I cant live like this anymore.

It used to be a crutch for me and ultimately I think it is what stopped me from figuring out how to be my best self. Its weird because only when I am high will I have these toughts. Getting home from work sober I wont even think twice about not smoking.

The sober me wants to smoke for relief. High me wants to quit for relief. I cannot ever get it and it is really scary. I'll pick up my guitar sober and it sounds so bad.  I'll boot up a game and quit after 5 minutes. And worst, when I toke up I am so antisocial I will not even respond to text from my friends. I have lost good friends this way. I have lost the ability to have casual conversations since all I did for the last 10 years is get home and smoke. 

I want to have a normal life.  But my mind has been so rotten from weed abuse for so long I cannot remember how to live without it.

What are some tips that helped you ? How long am I gonna feel this way ? Will I ever be able to live a normal human life ?"
One. Year. Free.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h9plc4/one_year_free/,2020-06-16 01:44:23,"2 days ago, on June 13, 2020 marked my 1 year weed and other subtance-free. 

I spent more than 5h browsing this forum with people having the same difficulty as I had when I stopped smoking weed. I stopped because of a panic attack when I was high. 

The first 6 months were the most difficult of my entire life. The first 3 the most horrendous. But, everything was a downhill after that.

I experienced extreme anxiety, panics, fear, weight gain and thousands of unpleasantnesses. I went to psychotherapy because of my anxiety. I started working out because of my weight gain. I started getting out of my comfort zone because of my fear and I started to enjoy life rather than smoking weed every night.

I do not regret it. It made me better. I didn't know who I was, what my limits were and what I was capable to do before I stopped smoking. I was always picked by others as ""the lazy one"". Turns out I'm not a lazy guy. Turns out I can get the job done and I can wake up early. After I stopped, my life was back on track. I sleep now better. I eat better. My emotions are under control. I remember things.

To whomever this is relatable, please try to stop and please understand that every emotion you feel, is temporary. Please go through my Reddit profile and check what I have posted and commented. You can notice my anxiety in the comments I've left and threads I have created. 

Life is worth living with your eyes open and mind cleared. Weed does not help. Weed does not define you.

Love you all.

Tips and Tricks I've picked up on my journies and by watching other people's too...,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fe4xwy/tips_and_tricks_ive_picked_up_on_my_journies_and/,2020-03-06 03:20:26,"So I've noticed this place gets a lot of ""about to start day 1, y'all got some tips?"" posts so I've collected a few here to hopefully help. Here goes...

First of all, well done. Well done for coming here and trying to help yourself. Well done for realising you have a problem and having the guts to do something about it. A lot of people stick their heads in the sand and pretend it's okay, but YOU reader, clearly haven't. Kudos to that. And, I'm proud of you right now even if you aren't.

First few days are an assault on the mind and the body. Big time. But it shall pass. And once the first hump is over with it gets easier in many senses.

Actual tip time:

Caffeine: this stuff is bad when you're quitting (well, all the time really if abused and us chemical abusers tend to overindulge...) So, if you currently abuse it to counteract the effects of weed as a normal part of your day, start tapering down. Don't cold turkey caffeine it's horrible. Try to limit the use to early in the day if you use it. That includes tea, and sodas with it in. Doing this will help ease anxiety and help you sleep.

Exercise: Mega good. Just do it. Not only will it tire you (help you sleep) but it'll release endorphines and help stress relieve. It'll also keep you busy and will help literally sweat the weed out. Saunas and steam rooms are also good for this. Even going for a walk is good. Get out of the house if you can, you are no longer a prisoner or a slave to your drug or thoughts so get back into the world again, you've been missed!

Hydration: Key. Keep fluids going and try to flush the weed out. I'm not saying drown yourself with water but you may get bad headaches if you're missing this step and it's an easy thing to miss.

Eating: A toughie. This can be a battle. I suffered with nausea and had no appetite for days. So I drank protein shakes and water for the first few days. Your appetite may disappear for a while but it will return. Nausea can be counteracted with ginger tea and ginger ale apparently. Give it a try if you're struggling.

Yoga / meditation / prayers / mindfulness. Can be very useful. Give em a try. Relaxes me a lot and helps me shut off the noise and grounds me. You may have a lot of internal battles coming up so learning how to overrule urges and bad thoughts should be a priority. Learn how to say ""no"" to any voice or notion that suggests weed is a good idea and one more won't hurt. It'll also help if you can find some positivity from somewhere, as you get free you'll feel it building inside you so listen to THAT voice and build on every bit of progress you make. It all adds up. 

Reading. In the first few days being alone with my thoughts was terrifying. So I took my mind elsewhere til I felt normal again. So read. Read anything, it doesn't matter much what it is although if you choose something you're interested in or related to quitting, even better. After a while I could enjoy movies etc again but for the first few days that wasn't happening.

Sleep hygiene. Super important. Day 1 literally strip your bed and wash the bedding and for the first night you'll have nice clean bedding which should help you enjoy your bed again (especially if it reeked of weed) Then set yourself a bedtime and stick to it. That means no phones, TV or devices that can distract you for at least an hour before your set bedtime. Nail this and the insomnia won't be as bad. And the sooner you can sleep properly the easier the battle is.

Communication and support. Find support (here is a great place) and talk whatever shit you're going through out. Sometimes you'll just want to rage but you'll feel better after it. Read some of my old posts if you want a laugh, I said some right crap initially 😂😂 family friends and even people online can be a massive help in stopping you feeling alone. You are not alone and others will understand. Not everyone will fully understand of course, but people here will certainly have been through similar so don't struggle on alone. Get to meetings or therapy if you can. The more weapons you can add to your arsenal the easier the battle will be.

Journalling / lists / accountability. I downloaded the Grounded app and in the first few days checked in every few hours. Every time I felt shit. I also used the check ins to write my thoughts down to get them out. Not everything I went through and thought about was I willing to share with others. I still use the app to check in now although I do forget. Being able to literally scroll through my thoughts and see that little acorn growing has been super useful. (Seriously download the app it's free 😆) it also tallies how much money you've saved and how far into each withdrawal you are so you can see ""Oh I'm 3 days away from not being angry anymore"" 😂 😂 but I also wrote a lot of things down by hand. The first few nights I needed to keep my hands busy so I just got some paper and went with it. I'm now trying to improve my handwriting in the evening and I'm getting there! It'll also help keep you accountable too. You won't want to lose your trophies you get for each day achieved either. Finding people to keep you accountable can help a lot too.

The lists side of things... I wrote reasons why I should stop eg it makes you selfish, it makes you dumb, it makes you apathetic. And then if I got the urge I looked at that list and remembered why I was doing this. I also  found a picture of some family and put as my phone background, to remember who I'm doing this for. That helped a lot in the early days. Now it's just a picture of the outdoors, something which I now enjoy again as a former addict now I'm free. 

Love, compassion and forgiveness. This is for you. Give yourself these 3 things. You deserve them. You've probably fucked a few things up in your life but it's not worth suffering forever for. We're all human. We all make mistakes. And the sooner you can give yourself compassion, the sooner you can forgive yourself. The sooner you forgive yourself the sooner you can love yourself again. And people who love themselves? Have the happiest lives and don't self harm with drugs....

The anxiety, loneliness and sadness will pass.

Hope that helps anyone who needs some guidance. And, as always, good luck and stay strong ❤️💪🏻❤️

r/leaves and Sober October...,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dcapdd/rleaves_and_sober_october/,2019-10-02 18:09:06,"Hi all!

Since we're seeing a whole bunch of new visitors as a result of Sober October (welcome!) I wanted to clarify our policy, as we will be modding out some posts and comments related to Sober October.

Sober October is about taking a break for a month.  Taking a break to reset your tolerance or re-evaluate your relationship with smoking are all great things to do, but we are a narrowly focused sub for people who have made the difficult decision that they have to stop for good.

As a result, unless you make clear that you are using Sober October as your Day 1 to a cannabis-free life, we'll be taking out Sober October posts.

As I say, breaks are great if that's what you want, but it's just not what we do.

The good news is that there's a terrific group for support with taking breaks and managing moderation called r/Petioles.  They can help you make Sober October a success, and when Halloween comes around and you decide it's actually time to quit for good, then you'll always be welcome back to r/leaves.

Good luck with whatever path you decide to take!

"Got in a fight with my wife, lost my work badge, had a panic attack, didn’t smoke.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/c8oymy/got_in_a_fight_with_my_wife_lost_my_work_badge/,2019-07-03 18:47:24,"That’s pretty much it. My wife and I are quitting together so arguments come up that shouldn’t and they last longer than they should, then we get out of my car and my badge isn’t where it should be, I spiraled hard, like sitting in the dark alone for 10 minutes and going mute, all I could think about was smoking, but from posts on this sub, I learned to argue with the devil on my shoulder, rephrase my thoughts to say “I’m glad I’m not doing the thing I know is hurting me” and etc. I didn’t smoke guys. I made it to day 3 for the first time since college and I’m so proud of myself right now. Gonna go to a matinee movie his morning and see how awesome movies are when you’re all the way there.

Love this sub, don’t know if I could do it without you guys."
"Weed is harmless for some, but for the addict it is a terrible life-stealer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8vv4m3/weed_is_harmless_for_some_but_for_the_addict_it/,2018-07-03 23:34:44,"Weed can be insidious precisely because it seems so harmless. And, sadly, the recent societal acceptance of its use only reinforces this false perception. It makes quitting very difficult for those of us who really need to stay off it for the rest of our lives. ‘It’s just a little weed, what’s the big deal?’ is constantly playing in our heads, tempting us back to it.  And what makes it even harder is that, for most people, weed is really perfectly ok when done in moderation. 

But for those of us who tend to abuse it, weed is as dangerous as any drug can be to living a truly full life. While the danger is not that weed could kill us, the fact that it is not deadly only makes it less likely that we will ever quit. Meanwhile, its non-deadly effects slowly steal our life away by putting life on fast-forward and distracting our minds from very achievable and important goals.

I’ve been clean for about 6 months after a 27-year habit. The most powerful perception that has kept me sober is realizing how much time I wasted chasing the weed high. That meaningless, fiendish chase blocked me from chasing and achieving so many positive things in my life. That chase robbed me of even solid memories of the few things I did achieve. It’s all a blur. Weed speeds up time. That’s what it does, especially when you abuse it.

If you are a weed addict, you should quit just so you can live and savor true life and not just some fleeting high. Quit so you won’t miss out on all that life has to offer. Quit because, if you continue abusing weed, one day you will wake up old and tired (in no time) wondering with great sadness where all that time went.  That is the ultimate injury of each so-called great high that weed provides us addicts. At the end of that road is nothing but a wasted life and deep regret for what you could have been without a substance that made you artificially happy no matter how little you accomplished.

Hello fellow sobers. Anyone else noticed how vivid your dreams are becoming? Or is it just me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hm48bp/hello_fellow_sobers_anyone_else_noticed_how_vivid/,2020-07-06 13:05:26,
"You have already survived the worst day of your life. What is the discomfort you are feeling right now compared to that? Right now you are making your way towards freedom and a better life, to not be addicted, and to live as your true self.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fdchge/you_have_already_survived_the_worst_day_of_your/,2020-03-04 15:45:41,"This is just a temporary moment in time where you go through withdrawals and cravings. How often have you regretted a day of being sober? How often have you regretted smoking, when you actually didn't have to and you only realise it as soon as you are high again? Right now, all the discomfort you are experiencing come from weed, not your sobriety.

Once your body deals with the remnants of the plant, and once you let go of the bad habit you are clearly wanting to let go, you won't feel so uncomfortable. When you fight in your head about ""to smoke or not to smoke"" it is draining. Your body and mind may say that you would feel better right now, if you just smoked a little.

While that may be true, you would know it doesn't last forever. Sooner or later, you will be faced with this discomfort again, so why not now? Why wait and postpone your freedom? Why feel the same suffering over and over again, before you have the courage to stay still through the cravings? You have the power to quit at any time, you are stronger than your emotions. You have the power of your free will, and while the habits and addiction patterns in your brain tells you to smoke, you can just be. They won't make you do anything, it's only when you keep fighting them and you are tired from fighting that you give in, it's always your power, it always will be. Everytime you decide NO, that thought of wanting to smoke loses some of its power. After awhile, it doesn't take much to say no, because that pathway in your brain is dying out, slowly but surely.

You'll get dreams of smoking, glorified thoughts of good times when you smoke, and idealisation of being high when you quit, that is normal. Don't be scared of the thoughts. When you notice you tense up, you can for example just sit a few minutes and feel everything in your body. Follow your breath and notice you are fine. Even if you feel like shit at the moment, you are alive, there's nothing to worry about. It will get better, IT WILL GET BETTER. Don't lose sight of what you want, don't give into fear.

Keep going my fellow leaves. Even when it's hard, it just strengthens you. Be proud of yourself even when you get the smallest time off. Don't blame yourself when you are learning, everyday is a new opportunity to learn, you haven't thrown everything away when you relapsed after a streak. You can learn from your failures.

For me it is currently day 14, and while I still feel like I'm recovering, I don't feel nearly as bad as the first 1-10 days. I get thoughts of smoking, but I know it isn't worth it so I'll keep going and I keep telling myself I'm still recovering. Sleep is getting better and that feels good, still it isn't a reason to smoke the tiniest bit. I've already experienced being addicted, it isn't fun, and I'm tired of fooling myself and keeping myself from achieving things that I want because I'm afraid, and it's easier to fall back to the reason of being high, and post-poning things.

I wish all the best to you.

Edit: I wanted to add this quote I posted sometime earlier in a comment:

***We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline, or the pain of regret.***

***The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.***"
Heavy smoker for 3 years. I just made it a month clean.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ckwe1f/heavy_smoker_for_3_years_i_just_made_it_a_month/,2019-08-02 03:54:00,"I used to go through an 1/8 every 2-3 days. I would smoke when I woke up, before work, as soon as I got home, before every meal, right before bed, and even in the middle of the night if I woke up so I could fall back “asleep.” I would carry a vape pen with me so I could smoke if I was away from home, even during my lunch breaks at work. I was basically high all the time. 

Beginning of July, I went cold turkey and gave it all up. I didn’t like the person I became and it wasn’t the person I wanted to be. 

The first few days were hard. Sleeping was almost impossible and I didn’t have an appetite, but I persisted. It got better after the first week and I began having dreams again when I slept. My appetite struggled for a bit but now I’m eating fine. 

I kept myself busy so I wouldn’t relapse. I joined a rock climbing gym and began being social again. Weed kept me contempt being home locked in my room alone. Now I’m excited to get out of the house. 
The biggest change I’ve noticed is time doesn’t fly for me now. The past three years felt like a quick blur, this past month has felt like an eternity. It’s only been 31 days but I feel like I’ve lived more in that time then the three years being high. 

I’m thankful for this sub and everyone’s inspiring  story’s. Reading what other people are going through and seeing that they could do it helped me not relapse and push through. 

I know you can do it too."

Stopping weed make me realize I have low self-esteem,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/icjkki/stopping_weed_make_me_realize_i_have_low/,2020-08-19 12:08:06,"Title says it all.

Been smoking for 12 years, daily unless I'm on vacation or some special circumstance. My mental health was ok until the last couple of years. But I would smoke to forget my problems, and to make myself feel good without having to accomplish any of my goals, and to daydream that one day (just around the corner) I'd be some big-shot who everybody loved.

Well after trying to quit and lasting 3 weeks, I realize that I do indeed have low self-esteem. Basically I am full of self-doubts, I am constantly judging myself against others negatively (like judging myself against geniuses and olympians... jeezuz...), and I talk down to myself saying I am just lacking something. Just the regular 'I'm not good enough' thoughts. And I have discovered the roots in my childhood and upbringing (never being complimented, never being praised when I did well, etc).

(textbook relapse too.... buying a little bit of weed everyday and smoking it all as ""this is my last time!!""... then doing it all again the next day)

So I am getting therapy because I need it for sure.... but yea, I suspect a lot of people on here also are suffering from low self esteem and smoke to forget, because that's what I did. Well I hope you can get past it. I hope I can get past it, with regular work on my part I know I can. I don't care if it takes 10 years, I will be a better me.

Stopping smoking has had all these negative thoughts flood back into my mind. And it's long overdue. So I guess I gotta pay my dues and put in my work on myself. All the time I spend smoking, years of my life, was spent to forget myself. Well now I must look clearly and work on myself, so I can improve what I don't like. I am in control of my life now, not the weed."

Energy levels restored. I’ve been working out like crazy and saving up my money. The beginning was tough but my appetite is finally back to normal. No trouble sleeping. I really had a huge budget for pot and never for anything else. I’m able to treat myself with nice things now.  It feels great. My relationships with people have gotten better and I’ve somewhat busted out of my introverted ways. No more ups and downs with my mentality (for the most part)

Everything seems like its on a clear plane, an even line of vision. No more weird bouts of paranoia. My desire to burn has gone up in smoke. I don’t feel the want to go back to the lifestyle. 

6 months might not seem like a lot, but after 7 damn years of daily, hourly smoking, it feels like quite the accomplishment.

I’m a sucker for instant gratification and weed is the lynchpin,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cxsgoc/im_a_sucker_for_instant_gratification_and_weed_is/,2019-08-31 10:00:44,"I overeat. I procrastinate. I lay around. I am a porn addict. I can spend crazy amounts of time on my phone. I have bouts of alcoholism. I am just a complete fiend for stimulation at my core, and really, it’s been that way as long as I can remember. Weed just made it all way worse.

Whenever I remove weed from the equation, I gain momentum with abstaining from the rest of my vices. The other habits fall like a house of cards.

It is so illogical that I keep falling into this trap. I’m so tired of it. I don’t enjoy smoking weed anymore, but whenever I abstain for a little bit (a week, if I’m on a *good* streak), it always just feels like something’s missing. I let my guard down, take a toke, and fall right back to square one. It’s incredible the mental gymnastics it takes to convince myself it’ll be “just once,” and it inevitably never is. But for some reason, I am discontent to some extent in either stage.

What’s really sad is that weed is like really bad now. I’m pretty sure I’m allergic from the reaction my body has to it. I don’t know why anyone likes hanging out with me when I’m high, because I just shut off. I become this zombified fiend. Nine times out of ten, I’ll be miserable and immediately wish I was sober. Somehow, I convince myself it won’t be that way though.

Well, no time like the present to try again. I can’t concede to the idea that I can’t do it, because that isn’t true. I just need to try harder, and be honest with myself about how hard I am trying, and remind myself how terrible I always feel when I slip.

Thanks for reading if anyone bothered to read all that. Would appreciate pointers."

Then you get ill ""Well, I may as well get high since I'll be in bed all day anyway""

And all of a sudden you've been smoking daily for 2 weeks without even realising it. Since the Covid-19 quarantine I'd fallen into the particular trap of ""treating myself"" because of the scary and stressful situation I found myself in.

Well now it's time to treat myself to some clear-headedness. Time to get my motivation back.

Suffering by Comparison-- the Illusion of Weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cu1kw2/suffering_by_comparison_the_illusion_of_weed/,2019-08-22 22:35:21,"I think for many people, it can be difficult to come to the understanding that they are better without weed. It's become so mainstream and pervasive in culture. There are tons of myths and misconceptions about it, mostly about how harmless it is. Who hasn't heard someone rant about why weed should be legal or how it's not as bad as alcohol, as if it's a novel point?

Also, weed, as many have pointed out, doesn't usually ruin lives. You can be high 24/7 and still make the case that you're life is fine. It's somehow become acceptable to be high all the time, yet it someone gets drunk every night they are an alcoholic?

This, combined with the fact that weed generally enhances any experience, causes us to be weary of the idea that being sober is better. I read in an article, ""How can weed be bad if it's good?"" 

The fact that weed is good IS the reason it's bad. It is a form of pleasure that is incredibly accessible and powerful. At first, weed will just make other pleasure more intense, like hanging with friends or going into nature. Over time though, it just becomes an act of desperation, melting into your couch, watching mediocre sitcoms, and eating junk food.

Even though what I described above doesn't sound all that great, and it really isn't, for a stoner it's the best thing they have. Weed take precedence over other pleasures. It's a sad but very true fact. If you smoke all the time, you will simply be less interested in connecting socially. You won't feel the same about your hobbies. Everything you once enjoyed will suffer by comparison to the extreme pleasure of smoking. The mundane, everyday drill of life will lose any of the excitement and novelty it had. You'll just be angrily trudging through the mud until you finally find relief, getting high at home. And even that starts to suffer by comparison to the 'old days' when you first started smoking.

So when you're trying to quit, and after a while the whispers in your ear try to convince you that, ""your relationship with weed wasn't really all that bad,"" just remember that it was. You quit for a reason.


Understanding the above has helped keep me from relapsing. I try to remember Albert Einstein's definition of insanity, which is: to try something over and over again, expecting different results."
One Year,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gnztf5/one_year/,2020-05-21 20:16:52,"Hey everyone. Tomorrow will be one entire year without smoking after ten years of daily use. I see there are many new members. I joined a little over a year ago and this community really helped me with my decision. I just wanted to thank all of you. The withdrawals and then the boredom were rough for a couple of months, but now it’s almost like I don’t think about it anymore at all. I turned my smoking time into reading time, and that really helped me get through the tougher times of quitting. 

Overall, I’d say my mental health has improved. I went up to a healthy weight as I was frail and couldn’t eat if I wasn’t high. I feel sharp and like a weight is off of me, and I feel clarity, like I am in control of my life. I have been going to therapy regularly and have been managing and working through my anxiety, PTSD, and depression in healthy ways instead of escaping like I always did with smoking. My grandfather was a longtime smoker as well, and lately he told me that “You are the captain of the starship.. to think anything in your life is in control is resigning your responsibility to yourself”, and I wanted to pass that to you guys. 

I’m hope someone sees this and it helps them keep pushing forward. Big love to you all."

I didn’t buy weed today,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hkepps/i_didnt_buy_weed_today/,2020-07-03 11:22:55,"I just turned 21 yesterday, so for the last 7 years I have been smoking marijuana regularly, and for the last 4 years I haven’t been able to go more than 24 hours without smoking.

I don’t smoke copious amounts, just a bowl once or twice a day. I have Crohn’s disease and it helps bring back my appetite, alleviate inflammation, and generally helps me when it comes out of remission. It sucks because it genuinely helps me with my disease, which makes it even harder to even begin fighting my dependence.

And my dependence is just that. I spend hundreds of dollars on weed every year (and I am a very poor college student.) because I have no control. I must always have it, and when I begin running low, I hit my man for another 1/2 ounce. 

When I don’t have it I go crazy. My anxiety flares to it’s worst places. I panic over everything. My life plan feels hopeless, the tasks I need to complete seem impossible, the consequences to failing feel like they’ll be the literal end of the world. I can’t relax. I can’t focus. I can’t enjoy the things I like to do when I’m high (which is everything.) Suicidal thoughts sometimes come in common as thinking about the weather. It has nothing to do with the high either. I can be high as fuck, but the second I finish my last bud the panic sets in untill ive worked out with my dealer what time I’m picking up the next day.

There’s physical effects on my body as well. I stop eating almost completely as my appetite is gone. For example, when I travel with friends outside the country I lose weight like crazy because I physically can’t eat while I don’t have access to marijuana. My friends (who are coincidentally non-smokers) literally make it a priority to figure out how to safely get their sick friend weed any time we travel then plan around finding places where I can smoke so I can actually eat around every meal. It makes me feel like a huge burden to them. On a different trip to the Middle East it was even harder and more dangerous to find, and my weight dropped over thirty pounds while I was there. My doctor was immensely alarmed but just chalked it up to heat and an exit from remission rather than the more serious problem that I have- not that I’ve discussed it with her.

I want to quit so bad. I have law school coming up after my final year in college and beyond that the world. I’m tired of this shackle holding me down where ever I go. 

Two days ago I realized that I was running out. But rather than immediately dropping another 90 on a 1/2 ounce, I decided I would wait until the next day. 

Yesterday something within me told me that I could do this. And I was able to resist texting my dealer and forced myself to eat lightly.

Today I kept myself busy with work and studying for the LSAT, but in the back of my mind the urge and panic remained, gnawing at me. I felt like I KNEW I was going to break down when I was home for the night and go buy again. 

But I didn’t. It’s now 3am and I’m resisting the urge to get my pipe and do a resin hit. I know that I have a long, long way to go and I don’t know if I can ever have a casual relationship with weed or if I need to cut it out completely. I also don’t know that I’m strong enough to keep this up.

But for the first time in years: I didn’t buy weed today."

"Day 57 - My mood is finally starting to level out. Took me about 50 days or so to start to feel 'normal'. This takes time, commitment, consistency, hard work and most of all, patience.

My mood has been much more consistent. Before, if I had a lack of sleep, that was a trigger for a depressing day. No joke, I'd be stressed and angry and just not in a good mood and I would be depressed. Now, I'm just tired like a normal adult. Wake up in a decent mood/kinda excited or whatever, but just tired like a normal fucking adult. I track my moods and the last week has been great. Even on Sunday, I was hungover AF but I wasn't depressed or triggered to smoke, I was just tired and hungover lol. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, DO NOT FUCKING GIVE IN. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PROGRESS AND GOT TO START OVER AND GO THROUGH ALL THAT DEPRESSIVE BULLSHIT AGAIN. 

&#x200B;

I have never been more determined to not smoke again or for a longgggg ass time. I love this consistent mood/sobriety life. Here are some keys:

&#x200B;

1. Consistent exercise 
2. Good diet
3. Talking with people and stepping out of your comfort zone 
4. Compliment and love yourself 
5. Take ownership of your life and stop being a bitch. Stay sober. Do the hard thing. Be an adult. No one gives a shit about you except you. Be cognoscente of your life decisions. The past is the past, the present in now and the future is determined by what you do right now. 
6. Fill your schedule with other things. You have to swap out being a stoner and doing nothing for actually doing something. Boredom is the biggest trigger to smoke.

I’m 26. That, in itself, is crazy! I always rationalize even though I know it makes me anxious, lazy, unable to communicate, a worse-version of myself. I now realize that’s my addict brain. I use weed for everything. Always tuning out, always procrastinating... My brain is now dependent on it, and it shows with my moods and my harmful behaviors and sleep patterns. 

I don’t want to accept the mediocre version of myself that weed perpetuates. I want to be clear headed. I want to heal the pain I’ve been avoiding since I started smoking. I have to be confident and present to do that- two things that weed doesn’t allow for. 

I smoked this morning before the gym(bc I’ve paired weed with everything) and normally I would smoke the rest of the day since I already started...tell myself to start sobriety tomorrow.. then never start... NOT TODAY I am going to run it out and stay sober. That was my last smoke, ya’ll. 

Is this also the place to vent about withdrawal? Bc I fear I have a gnarly few weeks of feelings coming."

Found a nugget of weed...,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/35mklx/found_a_nugget_of_weed/,2015-05-11 23:06:19,"I just moved to a new house with my lady. I was looking for the charger to my cordless drill (yay household chores!) and at the bottom of a box of junk I found a small nugget of weed.

I held that nug. I stared at it. I thought about hiding it so that when my lady was at work today, I could smoke it when I was alone.

I sized it up. I thought about just how high I'd get from that much weed. How many hits it would break down to. Four, maybe even five if I took small ones.

I smelled it. I looked for hiding places. I felt terrible. I saw a glimpse of my former self.

I went to the kitchen sink. I crushed up the nug, and smelled the herb and dammit I missed it. I tossed it in the sink, turned on the water, and watched it go away. Washed the smell off my hands, and went on about my chores.

The streak remains. Stay strong out there. "

&nbsp;

I'd been sober for 1 year and ~3 months, and had/have been feeling confident in my ability to abstain since the winter holidays. My life has changed drastically since I got sober, dream job, moved states, and most importantly I've recently begun to enjoy life without the use of intoxicants. When I first quit I thought I'd never have fun again, and that certainly seemed true for the first 6 months, but as time went on that's disproved itself over and over again. Being sober has given me the opportunity to address the root causes of my substance use (marijuana has always been my drug of choice, but in the past it didn't matter what I was putting into my body as long as I felt inebriated) I've made lots of progress on my depression and suicidal tendencies, and have gotten close to ridding myself of a previously crippling anxiety with the help of prescribed medications and Cognitive Behavioral therapy. Life still isn't perfect, it never will be, but 5-6/7 days of the week I feel damn good.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I drove a couple hours to visit an old friend, a brother, somebody who'd I'd lived with and used with, and the only person whose ever known me better than I know myself. He's still self-medicating with drugs in a very unhealthy way, and I knew going in I'd be around plenty of weed. In the past 4 months I've started going to parties again, and surprisingly having a great time regardless of being the only sober person and surrounded by intoxicants, so I wasn't worried about losing control of myself. And I didn't.

&nbsp;

We had a great afternoon, walked to the beach, longboarded, had the deep meaningful talks only two people who are on the same wavelength can. He was high the whole time, I was sober, but it felt just like the old times except less depressing. When we settled in that night to get lost in the weird depths of youtube, I had an idea. I knew I could have a perfectly fun time with him sober, but I wanted to try smoking again; an experiment. At the very worst I'd be starting from day 1 again and have a month or so of strong cravings, and at best I'd learn I could smoke recreationally. I was torn between trying the experiment or not, I thought it might be useful, but the thought of starting at day 1 again was painful. I decided to flip a coin, heads I smoke, tails I don't. The coin landed on heads.

&nbsp;

So I smoked.

&nbsp;

To my complete surprise it was...meh. I had built up what being high felt like in my head so much during my sobriety that the real thing just couldn't even come close to living up to it. At the end of the night while falling asleep I had the biggest shock of all, I regretted smoking. Not because I felt guilty for relapsing, or because I was worried I'd sent my self back down the spiral of abuse, but because I would have had more fun if I'd stayed sober. I disliked how cloudy I felt, how my anxiety got worse, and how I ate an entire bag of cereal dry. I disliked losing my train of thought, not being able to hold up a meaningful conversation, and the god damn cotton mouth. I disliked feeling sluggish, lazy, and like I'd be fine with never leaving the couch again. I disliked being high.

&nbsp;

What a marvelous revelation. I went from feeling like I was missing out by not partaking, to now being truly grateful that I'm not. I woke up this morning with no urge to smoke again. 

&nbsp;

This is truly the best outcome, one that I hadn't even considered."
My favourite quote about weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/53x6zb/my_favourite_quote_about_weed/,2016-09-22 07:47:37,"The best thing I've ever heard about weed comes from an episode of South Park, back in season 6 I believe, where Randy is finally honest with Stan about the dangers of smoking pot after using lies and manipulation to scare him away from it the whole episode. He says something along the lines of ""look, pot won't kill you, or turn you into some kind of monster, but the truth is it makes you feel ok with being bored. And it's when you're bored when you should be learning a new skill or bettering yourself in some way"". It's always really stuck with me, he's absolutely right. For the last two years of my life I spent high, I was just bored all the time and fine with it, and that's no way to live a life. Six weeks sober now, and really enjoying finally beginning to feel like a real person again"

I feel good, but unfortunately I really just have the urge to order a volcano from storz and Bickel and vape more than ever now, especially with how boring it has been during this whole covid situation. I’ve been making the most of my days, been working out frequently, reading a bit, making money investing, and getting straight A’s in all my online classes. Yet the monotony of life without being able to occasionally get a substance buzz and escape from dull-witted reality seems depressing and vainly pointless. Anyone else at this point who is feeling similar, or has any advice? I know how slippery of a slope it can be going back. As I’ve quit and went back many times in my life, but this is the longest I’ve ever made it, and the fact that I went balls to the wall and took drinking out fully too made it that much more challenging (although I’ve never had a problem or addictive personality at all with drinking). I know I’m strong enough to continue on this journey but I feel it to be pointless if I can’t still learn to truly enjoy life along the way and celebrate all the hard work I’ve put in. I’ve saved a lot of money, taken care of my body, and am blessed to have a great group of core friends and family around me, yet I just want to be able to enjoy a smoke session and a few drinks here and there. At this point I’m just rambling lol but all advice/perspective would be much appreciated. Much love to all of you✌️🙏"
The problem wasn’t so much weed; it was ME,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ctd4cv/the_problem_wasnt_so_much_weed_it_was_me/,2019-08-21 10:55:06,"This was being discussed at a meeting I went to. Yes, I know I can’t do it anymore. There is no way I can get into weed again and have it be OK. Just no way. And that’s scary to accept. But I have to if I care about myself. And I do care about myself. 

However I realize as time goes by that it wasn’t weed; it was ME. Because even after being weed-free for 6 months, I still have a lot of the same problems!! In other words, I am still me. Just a less crazy fucked up version. 

The immediate problems are gone, but I feel the long term ones stewing beneath the surface still. Maybe they will always be there. (Maybe I need to talk about them more so they are less threatening.)

I had to get weed out of the way so I at least have a CHANCE to change my longtime issues of isolation, low self-confidence, anxiety, procrastination, indecisiveness, anger, depression, and resentment. To name a few. 

My weed addiction wasn’t the root of the problem; it was the sign of how bad things had finally become inside."
Weed the Sleep Killer!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h8dpfl/weed_the_sleep_killer/,2020-06-13 23:15:12,"Weed is bad for your sleep. Sure maybe you get more hours of sleep, but the sleep is less restful, this has been well documented in multiple studies. Also do you think not dreaming could possibly be good for you? There is a reason we dream, and weed inhibits the dreams. I think dreaming and deep sleep has a lot to do with memory storage and function and this is why chronic smokers have memory and recall problems. Can’t remember the name of that band? Forgot you had to do that thing? Ditch the weed and dream again, get a solid nights rest and be ready for the day. Stop interrupting the nature of nature. We are primordial perfection, perfect as is; a magical robot. Weed is like mud on a white wedding cake."

i smoked because i was bored. then i was just bored and high.

i smoked because i was ""taking today off, and i'll be even more productive tomorrow!"" then i just wanted to take the next day off, too.

i used to do things! i used to read books and play music and go on adventures. and then i started doing those things while high, and wow! it was so much fun. and then smoking weed *became* the activity, instead of being *part* of the activity. and then i just smoked weed. and then i was just boring and high.

i have used the herb to escape many things in the last seven years. i'm in professional school. i'm in great shape and have a sexy girlfriend. i have all the things most people cite when needing reasons to ""quit and get their shit together."" but i am capable of even more! everyone is capable of more. i have not had a healthy relationship with cannabis for a long time.

i am on day five and not smoking is just fucking great. i am proud of myself every minute that i choose to do something other than smoking weed.

i did LSD and mushrooms a couple of times during college in the name of psychedelic exploration- some of my best realizations about life and my place in it came from those trips. i remember being so damn uncomfortable at times on acid, and i remember the glorious, triumphant comedown on the back end of a trip. i remember thinking i had overcome something, and i was always beautifully aware and mindful and focused in the days after the trip. 

i decided to treat the first few days of sobriety like a ""trip."" i embraced being uncomfortable. i embraced sitting on my couch sweaty and unable to sleep on the first night. i embraced the unpleasant disruption of my nightly ritual. i was *present* with myself, and for the first time in months i actually *felt* what i was feeling. it wasn't pleasant, but it was real. and it was so much better than 'just getting high.'


change is a natural part of life. don't be afraid to change. don't be afraid to be a better version of yourself. don't be afraid to be present within your own life- if you spend it numb and stoned, it could slip you by.

Weed and Depression: Lying to Yourself,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d1mgzg/weed_and_depression_lying_to_yourself/,2019-09-09 09:14:24,"This post is about my experiences with a deep and dark depression, and my abuse of cannabis which only exacerbated the issue. 

To start off, I will give some background to my issues with depression. I grew up in an abusive household. My first experiences with it came before birth as I’ve heard stories of my father beating my mother while she was in the late stages of being pregnant with me. Black eyes and cut faces were not an uncommon sight in my household. On the night of my 11th birthday my mom couldn’t take it anymore and I watched as she attempted suicide in my kitchen. After that night my parents were divorced. The divorce was tough on me and the first time I’d attempted suicide I was 11-12. I remember praying to God asking him to take me to heaven as early as 6 years old. I went through most of my life horribly depressed and didn’t realize it until highschool.

This is where weed came on the scene. My sophomore year I smoked for the first time and felt really good. I remember equating the feeling to when you’re walking barefoot on hot sand on the beach and then you touch the water of the beach and instantly feel that cooling sensation. Weed and me were a match made in heaven. I spent the next three years smoking everyday, and doing relatively well in life. I was a captain on my football team, and a top 10 hurdler in San Diego county. I also had a relatively high GPA. I graduated highschool and this is where it all came crashing down.

My first year spent in the real world was a wake up call because I could no longer use my highschool achievements as a crutch since they no longer mattered. To make matters worse I had lost my motivation for sports and quit my collegiate football team. (I truly blame this on my weed abuse). 

This is where my depression caught up with me. I could not get out of bed when I had free time for the life of me. I would get home and immediately just collapse on my floor and dream of killing my self. The only thing that got me out of the house was to smoke weed. I would feel good then, but the entire day before that point would be consumed in suicidal thoughts. I lied to myself so much about my weed abuse, saying that it was helping my depression when in reality it only made it worse. I only felt good when I smoked, and the rest of the day was a pit of despair.

Oh May 24th of this year I had worked up enough steam and decided that was going to be the night I killed myself. Only when it came time to do it I pussied out. Thank God I did. 4 days later I got a call with a job offer in Wyoming. I accepted with no second thoughts, and have been here the last 2 and 1/2 months. In that time I have not smoked. My depression has slowly reversed. I attribute it to my sobriety, and this new feeling of moving forward with my life. Each day gets easier. I still long for weed, and want to smoke so badly. Not sure if that will ever go away. My belief is that my brains reward system is slowly being reset to normal levels. I feel good when I accomplish something or learn something new. This is what gets me out the door whenever I have free time to do hikes or adventure. I never used to care about these things because my mind was set on snapping a big old bowl that evening.

Tl:dr/The point of my story: Weed fucking bodies your desire to experience new things. Being uncomfortable is good because it often implies growth. You will not grow in the hazy comfort of beautiful bud. Weed should not be considered a medicine for depression because it only makes you comfortable in the circumstances which caused the depression in the first place. You train yourself to be content with something which your spirit despises. Depression, anxiety, and anger are the mechanisms your spirit uses to tell your conscious mind to fucking change something. If you shut your spirit up by sedating it, your spirit is still dying but you no longer have the motivation to change the pattern."

Just because you have a long sobriety spree doesnt mean you can smoke again and control it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8woubk/just_because_you_have_a_long_sobriety_spree/,2018-07-07 03:44:47,"My warning. 

Im a 23 year old guy from Canada. I first tried the devils lettuce when i was just 13 years old. From than on out i had always had an unhealthy relationship with weed. It took over my life for 7.5 years untill i finally had enough and quit. July 1st wouldve been my 3 year sobriety, but i relapsed back in december. After 2.5 years of sobriety 

For 2 and a half years i was clean! 2 and a half years! And than this Christmas i thought hey you know what? I can have a little puff, why not? and i tried it. Nope. I tried to justify it in my mind like oh ""now ive got my career started ive finished school ive basically cured my depression and anxiety i wont use weed as a crutch this time around because now im in control of my life."" 

I had one bong rip. One. And 2 days later i bought a half ounce of kush a bong and a grinder. 2 months after that i was already onto extracts. I started with ""only smoking on the weekends"" (ya okay hemphead) and at its peak i was dabbing 3-4 times a day. Every. Day. 

Guess what? My anxietys back my depression is DEFFENITLY back and now my irritable bowel syndrome is back as well. 

Why?

Why'd i throw it all away? 

Because thats addiction. My brain was still against me. It still after all this time manipulated me into thinking i was okay to smoke. 

Im not.

1 Year/365 Days Weed Free - This Is What I’ve Learned: A No BS Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ggdz26/1_year365_days_weed_free_this_is_what_ive_learned/,2020-05-09 15:36:40," 

So you’ve decided you wanna quit smoking weed. Maybe you’ve been thinking about it for a while and you’re yet to make the change. Maybe you’ve started quitting already and it’s early days. Or maybe you’ve tried and failed multiple times and are just finding it too easy to get back to smoking that shit and going back to square one. This has ended up kinda long but I’ve tried to keep it readable. Besides, spending a few minutes making the effort even if you don’t feel like it at the beginning might be the kind of thing you can apply in your attempt to quit weed for good (more on that later).

&#x200B;

Some background (bear with me). I personally tried and failed a few times; I went about 6 weeks during one effort. There was a week here, a day or two there. I always seemed to go back to it at some point, but I wanted to quit and I didn’t like the way my life was with weed being a constant part of it: During my days of “peak usage”, and even at minimal usage to be honest, it’d be stuff like choosing to smoke after work instead of building new skills, being too stoned to cook so ordering shitty expensive takeaways or avoiding eating altogether, doing the bare minimum in terms of household tasks, wanting to watch a movie/play a video game high, but as soon as I was high I couldn’t even be bothered to choose a film or start up a game; I’d just sit in front of youtube consuming short form videos at the press of a button as it got later into the night and the videos got progressively more useless. Being too lazy to brush my teeth before bed, pissing in a bottle sometimes instead of leaving my room to walk across the landing and use the toilet at night, being unreliable, disorganised, life admin tasks building up around me, putting off social engagements because I’d rather be in my little stoned bubble. It was disgusting. Pathetic.

&#x200B;

I was 33 when I began my most recent effort to quit, and weed had been a part of my life to varying degrees since I was around 17. For a while there it was great. Smoking after work with friends and laughing until it hurt, smoking alone and having all my activities enhanced and just… better. I moved in with some friends and we all smoked every night, played games and just had a great time. I was in my twenties now and weed was just the best. Things were  fun and weed made it even more so. I moved in with a girl and my usage dipped. It was still in my life once or twice a week, but I smoked less (I was never a daytime, wake and bake kind of guy anyway. I’d do it occasionally but always felt a bit dirty being stoned and still having the day ahead of me. I guess I always had some kind of standard about what my lifestyle ought to be). Still, I was getting older - mid to late twenties at this point - and still wasting my time after work and not really making any life progress. I’d sleep in late, play video games, watch movies. My girlfriend was the opposite. The inevitable happened, I moved into a place on my own. It was a dark time and weed came back to comfort me. I decided to go self employed at the time too. Let me tell you, weed and depression do not make a good combination if you gotta be switched on enough to start a business. It was the worst, most shameful period of my life.

&#x200B;

So, after a few more years of being at rock bottom in every aspect of my life, seeing how my friends had transformed over the years from outgoing guys to introverted stoners (they still are to some degree. One of them now lives with me and his weed use is at an all time high) my mindset began to change and I started thinking seriously about how to get my shit together. 

&#x200B;

At this point I’ll offer you what I believe to be an important piece of advice: **Quitting weed will not solve your problems**. **But it will remove the obstacle that’s blocking your chances of solving them**. You land on the beaches of Normandy and start strutting around like the job is done, you're gonna get mown down. You gotta keep moving forward if you're gonna win the war. 

&#x200B;

I’ll also say this: I don’t believe I was addicted to weed. I was addicted to the short term dopamine rush I'd get when I finally sat down to smoke and enjoy short term, shitty rewards in the form of youtube videos, porn, junk food etc. Try rolling a joint and then just not smoking it for a while. It’s not so hard because you know it’s there whenever you want to light it up. Smoking that joint? It’s wonderful. As soon as it’s finished? Boring. Oh well, better roll another. It’s not being stoned that’s fun; it’s *getting* stoned (not counting the early days when you start smoking weed). In fact, if you’re reading this you’re probably at that point where being stoned makes you feel like shit every night as you try to mask the state of your situation. So no, I don’t believe I was addicted to weed. I was addicted to that life of short term dopamine and zero effort, which leads me to what I consider the “secret” to quitting weed, and to a better life than your current one:

&#x200B;

**Discipline**. **The way to stop smoking is to not smoke**. The way I did that is via not being soft and going right back to smoking the minute it started getting hard. If I really wanted to quit and better my situation then that’s what I had to do, no two ways about it. **Nothing worth doing is easy**. The hard times will last a week or two - nothing in the grand scheme of things. But it might feel like everything at the time because you’ve conditioned yourself as a stoner to avoid any kind of real effort. **The weed life is the easy life, the easy life is the shit life**. Expect sleepless nights, vivid dreams, nightmares, a feeling called boredom you might not have felt for some time. The feeling of having nothing to do. Except that’s isn't true. Start using that feeling to do something else. Get up, sort your paperwork, tidy your house, do the dishes, brush your teeth, start a project, pick up a project you left hanging, start some tutorials on something. These amazing feats of productivity are what regular people call real life, something I had been numbing myself to all this time while I polluted my brain with weed. And the more you do these tasks, the more they become normal. So you start picking up new ones bit by bit. They snowball. I’m sure you might find it easy to play an RPG; start a character from nothing, grind along the way, keep levelling up, completing repetitive quests for that sweet reward, getting better and more powerful along the way - as humans that’s what we do to make us happy, but you gotta apply it to your own life.

&#x200B;

One of my favourite motivational guys, David Goggins, calls it callusing the mind. The more hard shit you do, the stronger your mind becomes and the easier those things become. Back then I was soft. I had to become hard. As humans we’re supposed to do shit. We do a task to some degree of difficulty, we complete that task, we feel good about it. The harder the task, the bigger the reward when it’s complete. You even get a reward for pursuing the task in the first place and actively making progress. It’s keeping on top of these tasks and objectives, following some form of path, that gives us a feeling that some might call happiness.

&#x200B;

But back to the weed. I wasn't doing shit until it was gone. It’s a plant. I was destroying my life by smoking a plant. It had to stop. You can make quitting easier for yourself by tapering off for a while. That’s exactly what I did. I smoked one joint a night for around a few weeks before my most recent attempt to quit. And I’d smoke it right before bed. I’d get all my shit done using discipline, reward myself with the joint. But a joint every night is still weed every night which meant weed in my system holding me back, so it had to go.

&#x200B;

I stopped smoking one year ago today and I’ve never looked back. I don’t miss it at all. I live with a stoner; my friends are stoners. The phrase “high on life” always seemed like bullshit to me but it’s accurate. There was a time when watching a movie without weed would have seemed so boring, so vanilla, but I don’t notice it now. Ever watched a film baked, felt like you were completely immersed, then barely remember watching it the next day? I’m 100% dialled in to everything via a combination of zero weed, and effort to keep the plates that are my life spinning. And I’m far from a success, by the way. But I get out of bed with no grogginess, I arrive to work early, I brush my teeth every night without fail, I pay my bills early, I add to/tick things off of my Google Keep to-do list every night, I work out 3 days a week right after work, I sit at my computer after work and build my skillset, I tick that off my Loop Habit Tracker app every day along with “Don’t Smoke Weed” that I added on there exactly a year ago today. I keep on top of household tasks, I don’t nap anymore, I sleep about 8 hours a night of real, good quality sleep with real dreams, I wake up early even on my days off. I look and feel better than I have for years. I’m responsible and I’m organised. I’ve just sat down and typed this out a few days before I posted it as it was on my to-do list and I wanted to have it typed up ready for today.

&#x200B;

Anyway, It won’t be easy but nothing worth doing is. The weed life is the easy life, the easy life is the shit life. Stay Hard, as my man Goggins would say."

14. Uncertainty of my true feelings
15. Gateway to other addictions
16. No energy to do mentally difficult tasks or tiring tasks
17. Easily more irritable when doing meticulous tasks. I think ""screw this I just want to be high""
18. “Pot is for the people who want to distract themselves from the difficulty of reality”
19. Wasting time, sitting around, lazy, anti-social
20. Causes daydream about a different, better life that leave me stuck

Ive been getting high for about 8 years and I realize how strongly its affected me living the life of my dreams. In fact I've realized that getting high has been a distraction used as a tool to make myself feel better for not following my passions and what my spirit is telling me. Im on the spectrum of one or the other. Especially when I'm home alone getting high often.

Don't get me wrong, weed has many beautiful benefits. But when it becomes an escape from what I'm really feeling, it causes suffering. Weed has always been there for me when I haven't been there for myself. When I've neglected my feelings, my energies, my passions. I turn to weed to make me feel better. So thank you weed for what you've done so far. But I can handle the rest without you.

Smoked more last joints than some ever have.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bkkl9n/smoked_more_last_joints_than_some_ever_have/,2019-05-04 16:21:18,"Hey there guys, first post here and generally more of a lurker on reddit but I figured I'll share some stuff here, because it's quite important for me and my journey of quitting.

&#x200B;

So, I'm living in Germany, 20 years old and have been smoking for close to 6 years, way too long to begin with. Since my 18th Birthday I've probably smoked close to everyday, not huge amounts like some of you may have, but at least 1-2 joints per day, way more on the weekends obviously...Smoking for so long I think it's just logical that almost all my friends are smoking as well, which doesn't make any of this easier. I'm also living in an area where weed in general is just really popular and easily accessible, which stems from the fact that we are really close to the netherlands.

I think most of you can relate to the good ole days, somehow getting your weed after getting send from number to number, sneaking through the neighbourhood looking for a secret smoking spot, then sneaking in high as fuck and having the time of your life laughing your asses off over hilarious convos and videos.

But somehow someway these times started to fade, the more you smoked, the more regular it got, the more it went from this really fun high to a quite boring, couchlocky, demotivating high. Binging some stupid tv shows, not remembering half of it, playing video games spaced out af, just kinda vegetating together in your room. While others went out with their friends, doing fun activities, going to the bars (not saying that alcohol is better, but you get what I mean) you were just living life on standby. And weed kinda told me that it was ok. It never really occured to me just how much time I was wasting day to day, night to night doing something, but not really doing anything at all. I guess some of you can relate.

&#x200B;

Somewhere around last year my highs have also become quite uncomfortable, with racing thoughts almost everytime and not really enjoying the high anymore at all. It happened really often, but I still continued because ""the good old highs will come again for sure"". But no, weed started giving me really bad panic attacks most of the time, which maybe started because my life didn't fall apart per se, but it just didn't go the way I wanted it to. School was not going as well as it should have, me and my gf of 2.5 years broke up and in general I just became kind of a sad person deep down, even if it didn't seem so to most other people, I was pretty good at masking it. To this day I don't know if I really had some kind of depression, but I just wanted to numb everything out with weed, which didn't work anymore because of those panic attacks.

&#x200B;

A few months ago I stumbled across this subreddit in a /r/trees comment section and scrolled through here for a bit, but I was still convinced that all of my problems didn't have anything to do with weed (which I know not all of them do, but most of them). More to that later.

&#x200B;

Also a few months ago I found the instagram page of a girl that really sparked my interest, she literally looks like the girl of my dreams, I couldn't create a more beautiful girl for me even if god gave me the tools to do so, she also lives in the town right next to mine. I said fuck it, send her a message and she actually answered, even though she is in my eyes way out of my league. We were messaging on and off and a few weeks later we arranged a date. At this time I was still smoking daily. The day came, we met and I was nervous as fuck, probably the most nervous I've ever been, more nervous than before my A Levels or aynthing like that. Weed also made my social anxiety and awkwardness worse, which didnt help at all.The date went okay, but after she messaged me and told me that I was just not really conversative, not really talking much myself, just answering to stuff that she said and generally not really coming up with topics myself. That shit hit me hard, I used to be a really witty talker, not to tap my own shoulder or anything, but I used to be a good talker. Hearing this from her, kinda opened my eyes, I didnt even notice how much weed had affected my ability to socialice with other people, how much it affected my life in generaly, how little I was actually doing in life that I have so little interesting stuff to talk about. It kinda crushed me, but we still continued messaging and all that, but not much anymore.

Now last sunday was the day I decided it was time to quit for good, my lungs were getting fucked up, I felt foggy all the time, you know what I'm talking about. This wednesday I then messaged her again, asking if we might meet up again, and luckily she agreed for this friday, yesterday.

Again I was nervous, but not close to as nervous as I was the time before.

And what should I say, it went great. My socials skills were back after almost a week, I could hold a conversation and eye contact, come up with topics, ask interesting questions about stuff she talked about and generally engage so much more in the conversation.

She told me she had a great time and it seems like we'll be meeting up more often now, and I couldn't be happier, it's encouraging me even more to stay off of weed, the best motivation I could probably have, getting the girl of my dreams.

One year weed free today!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hpe1vd/one_year_weed_free_today/,2020-07-11 21:34:17,"I smoked weed daily for about 4 years (from 21 to 25 years old) and smoked frequently with friends for 5ish years before that. 

At this date last year I was in the hospital, hooked on an IV after a week straight of not being able to eat or drink anything. As soon as I got to the hospital and told the triage nurse what symptoms I had, she asked me if I smoked weed frequently, to which I said yes. I got sent into the back on a bed straight away, and after a while a doctor came and told me I was very likely suffering from Cannabinoid Hyperhemesis Syndrome. 

I had read a little bit about it before, but I’ve had issues with digestion and vomiting (which I take meds for) for a long time before I started smoking weed regularly so never thought the 5-6 times I was sick every month were due to the fact I was smoking too much marijuana... Then the doctor told me the only real way for the constant nausea, not being able to eat, and vomiting to cease was to stop smoking weed. 

I haven’t smoked since. 

I was so sick all the time I just couldn’t take it anymore, and the fact that the answer to my problems was so “easy” made me stop smoking right there without looking back. 

I can’t say I didn’t miss weed at all during the past year. I did. I missed it *a lot* at first, because it was such a habit for me and it was kind of like a safe place. I had to relearn how to do everything sober, like watching tv shows, drawing, sleeping, and eating. It was really hard at first, and I felt like shit and I wanted to smoke so bad sometimes, but on the other hand I could eat everything and not risk throwing it up after a few hours or the next morning, and that was the thing that trumped every other insidious weed smoking thoughts I had. 

I am also fortunate enough to have a very supportive girlfriend who helped me through the process. She also, on my request, took my weed box and hid it somewhere in the house. I haven’t tried to search for it once, and I am pretty proud of that. 

Overall, I’m really happy that I stopped smoking. I didn’t want to see that I smoked a lot and that I used weed to hide from my problems. I am also much more healthy now (I’ve gained weight, but at least it’s because I can eat all the things and not throw up every other morning ahaha) and I think about weed way less. 

I’m still nostalgic of the times I spent high with my friends and what fun we had, but I’m still able to have as much fun with them sober. I’m also happy that I dream every night now, it makes sleep that much more interesting! And I’m not ever paranoid that people will know I’m high anymore because I’m never high anymore ahaha. 

I feel like I’m rambling so I’ll end this here (this is so long I’m so sorry), but I’m really glad for this community. I’m just a lurker, but it helped me to see other people’s experiences with quitting weed and it greatly helped me to see that recovery is not linear and that having setbacks is okay. 

I wish everyone here the best and to have a great day!"

Nearly 4 Years Clean,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bujkc1/nearly_4_years_clean/,2019-05-30 00:15:46,"As I approach this time of year I always think about when I finally made the decision to quit relying on smoking a plant every day to feel ""good"". I think I would have fit in as your typical stoner. I smoked for 8 years daily, always when hanging out in my friends garage, playing music or countless hours on my PC playing video games. I thought it made these things I loved so much better. I thought anyone who didn't get high and listen to the Avett Brothers live vol 2 was really missing out. It felt so critical to my enjoyment in life that I never imagined I would stop. 

One morning I woke up, and in a total light bulb moment I decided I wasn't going to smoke. I didn't need it today. I dont know what made me do the next step, but I packed up my stuff and ran to drop it in my trash can literally as the garbage truck was 2 houses away. I felt a sudden calmness, and of course some panic, as that trash bin dumped into the truck. Still standing in the driveway the next thing I did was delete all my dudeman phone numbers from my phone, and thus started a new life. I decided to try some new things, escape my comfort zone, and just a few weeks after I quit I met someone exciting. 

Since then, I've gotten married, bought a house, got a few promotions, and now have a beautiful daughter. I love all of my hobbies even more than I did when I was smoking. I am more focused and have a clearer mindset on life and the person I want to be. I quit simply because it wasn't as fun as it used to be. I outgrew it. Something we all eventually do. The choice is yours in the end on when its time to move on.

There have been so many times where I’ve said I’m going to quit, or at the very least play that “maybe if I just smoke once a week” game in my head, yet I always end up relapsing back into daily use. I have a serious love/hate relationship with weed. When I’m sober, I wanna smoke really bad. Yet when I’m baked, I wish I had stayed sober. The weed buzz is really nice, but along with it comes with a long list of downsides: Anxiety, depression, laziness, fear of conflict, fear of death, way more anti-social, inability to focus on my studies, munchies, need more sleep, lack of motivation to do shit even after the buzz wears off...

I’ve actually cut out a lot of bad habits during the Covid pandemic, and I’ve therefore been really proud of myself...mostly. I’ve been smoking less (up until the last couple weeks), I’m drinking less (granted I wasn’t a big drinker beforehand either), I quit jacking off, I quit caffeine, and while I still eat meat, I’ve incorporated more plant-based meals into my diet. And I’m starting school in two weeks for my M.S. in computer science. That said, I just can’t see myself being as successful in school as I want to be if I don’t cut weed out of my life entirely. I don’t even think I can be one of those “just during Christmas time” or “just during my birthday” people, because then it will be the only thing I think about all year. I wish I had that kind of control, but I’ve proven over and over and over that I don’t. I don’t even think I can drink, because my desire to smoke increases tenfold when I’ve been consuming alcohol.

I have smoked north of 3gs every day for 11 of those 16 years, bar 2 when I was stuck in a hospital for a week - I had some delivered for the remainder of my time there. 

18 days ago I read the threads on r/leaves and they inspired me so I want to share my experiences so far and I'll be brutally honest. 

ITS THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE. It may also be the hardest mountain you ever climb but it's possible and its f$%k%&g worth it.

I've had two real phases so far.

1st: 

10-12 days of utter misery, depression beyond anything I've ever experienced (I've been in residential therapy before due to PTSD and this was worse). The anger and rage was unreal, the lack of sleep was physically painful and I resigned from my job in a tantrum and cut off life long friendships for good. It's unbearable and heartbreaking but each day I didn't smoke, or give in and I woke up feeling slightly more balanced. 

There were 48 hours when suicide was the only option I saw feasible. On these days, I took diazepam (Dr's orders over the phone) and slept. Perhaps I cheated but the alternative would have been worse- But... I didn't smoke. 

There were other symptoms I experienced but everyone is different.

Phase 2:

In the last week I'm definitely more irritable than I was when stoned but I'm calming more, day by day. My appetite is returning, and I've slept two nights for 7 hours now without it taking an age to get there. 
My sex drive is non existent and headaches are pretty overwhelming but my physical craving for smoke has 99% passed. Finally. I still haven't had one dream/nightmare though...  

I can say that today I have 'seen a light'. I feel like I can think more and feel more (in a good way). I'm excited about life and my future. 

If I'd given in and smoked, or hung myself, I'd never have seen this 'light' which I'm confident will help me through the rest of my recovery. As deep as it sounds, it really is so real and possible that anyone wishing to quit, no matter how long you've smoked, CAN. 

I've got a long way to go yet and I'm sure there'll be more phases as I progress to gaining my life back. This is new territory for me as a man and no longer someone hiding behind a joint. 

One thing I'd say helped me the most:

Whatever you feel, however dark and physically unbearable, DO NOT GIVE IN, no matter the excuse. Be it succumbing to sadness and smoking - DO NOT SMOKE and I promise, it'll get brighter. The first week, two weeks, might even even be longer for you, it will get better.

Now it's looking like I'll have my job back, and I can start to think of a wider plan. It's a tiny step in paying back the pain caused to myself for over half of my life but it's the beginning. 

I hope everyone going through this journey feels empowered by this community and I'm really excited for anyone getting their life back. 

You can do it. It is possible and your life will be the way you feel it should be. Its just that first step to see a brighter you and cut that shit out of your existence. 

Good luck r/leaves fam- I'm excited for everyone here and send you all the power and courage I can. 

You'll do it.

I'm sorry,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fb4klh/im_sorry/,2020-02-29 03:44:50,"At some point in the past... Was it a year ago? Maybe two? I came across this sub or one like this, where all participants focused on giving up weed. I scrolled through the titles, thinking something in the lines of ""wow, these people clearly cannot handle their weed. Maybe it really is not for them"". Myself, I had no intention of quitting. I knew it was slightly inconvenient to always think about having enough, always chasing the high, but I knew I was not like these poor souls who need to quit to feel better about their lives. People who let weed ruin them. I knew people who would become paranoid and very affected after one puff, so they had to stay sober. I used to smoke bowls while hanging out with them and feel so in control of myself. I thought it was those people who end up addicted and miserable. 

But I was different, was able to handle it well, I was ""cool"". Ha ha ha. I had other interests besides weed, scholarly, artistic, athletic pursuits and refused to believe weed was changing my ability to perform them. 

I'm sorry. My judgment, even though never outwardly expressed, was a real stoner thought process. 

Recently after quitting few other habits, I clinged on to smoking weed, because it was a relationship for life, I assumed! Slowly but surely it became clear the substance was stalling me, impeding my growth and rhythm, affecting all aforementioned interests and results thereof. Putting a wall of smoke between me and people, smokers and non smokers. Obscuring the experiences and connections. 

In the emptiness caused by not being high I can catch and recognize many more thought forms flying through my consciousness and not fall into a self perpetuating ganja loop. Had a puff the other day and really felt it... 

I became like those kids who can't handle their weed ;)"

I was angry and wanted to cry. i made dinner for my family and hated it, no flavor despite them liking it. Hubby was standing in the kitchen wrong (wtf does that even mean??). Just a horrible night. I really wanted to give in and just be happy.

I didn’t though, I cleaned my house, played with my kid, snuggle my cat. Knit a sweater I started last year for my husband to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, I didn’t realize I could angrily knit lol! I’m almost done with it now!

I couldn’t fall asleep until 1am and daughter woke up at 3am because of the storm. I fell asleep on her floor while holding her hand and comforting her. 

Despite all that I woke up feeling okay. My eyes are super funky but I made it though a rough night. Thank you everyone."

I want to feel all my feelings without your fog.

I want to know just how bold I can be.

This is my adventure, and you are holding me back.

That is why I've decided, to break up with you.

As soon as I woke up, I ate breakfast and headed to a friends new apartment in a major city. We were going to drink mimosas and watch college football before attending an MLB game at 7pm. Around 2 o’clock, they convinced me to rip the bong. 

I used to smoke everyday for 2+ years. I took some time off and eventually ended up “quitting.” 

I ripped the bong and my day was ruined. I was in a sleepy/dazed state until I went to sleep that night. I felt like shit at the game. Even before we left for the game, I was half asleep. 

I became lazy, unaware, and antisocial because of weed. This awesome day we had planned was ruined by my inability to just say no. 

How did I used to function off weed..? *I probably didnt* but now that I’m living sober, I can actually realize how much it was fucking with my powerful sober mind."

I’m 44, been smoking weed since I was a teen and the only thing I’ve learned about quitting is it just doesn’t happen that way. 
There’s a reason you (we) keep saying tomorrow, and that’s because you didn’t quit today. Tomorrow always seems like it will be the easy day to do it. You’ll wake up refreshed, focused, motivated and ready to quit....right? 

A whole lot of tomorrows have turned into yesterday’s. And that means a whole lot of failed quitting days. It adds up in your psyche.  The more you feel like a failure the more you use to cope. The more you tell yourself you just can’t quit. 

Instead tell yourself you need to quit. And maybe you’ll do it tomorrow or maybe the next day. And maybe it takes a while. But hopefully one day soon you’ll wake up and tell yourself that it’s today. 

For me the first day is and always has been the hardest. I never know when that day is coming. It’s always a surprise. Once I get one day under my belt I know I can do two. On day 3 today.

Why I Quit (High Binge Eating),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bx4doh/why_i_quit_high_binge_eating/,2019-06-05 20:13:02,"I don’t have any contempt towards weed, or anyone who smokes. I still have a lot of friends who continue to smoke and I respect them.
I quit for a multitude of reasons, none too large or theatrical. To be honest about it, the overeating was the worst aspect of smoking.
I know overeating is typically joked and characterized in the cannabis community, or even at them, but for me it turned into a serious issue. When I was high, or in that post-high haze, I’d crave, and crave only, junk food. Sugar, trans fats and processed to a shred.
If I could smoke and maintain a healthy diet, feeling no urge for junk food, I’d probably still smoke. I’d ask friends, “how do you smoke and NOT get hungry for 2 large dominos pizzas?” Each answer was different but not significant enough to change my eating habits. Even if I encouraged myself to eat carrots and water while smoking, the cravings would always return.
I’ve felt an unbelievable amount of benefits since I’ve quit smoking, but that’s a post on its own. My point is, THC-induced binge eating was not some funny stoner stereotype for me, but a day-ruining consequence that could only be stopped in one way: cessation of smoking altogether.
If anyone can relate to this feeling, then I’ll feel accomplished in posting this."

I started smoking weed when I was 15 years old. I was excited to try it - I had heard it helps with anxiety and opens your mind, both things I wanted very much. It quickly became a daily habit. I do believe it helped with my depression for awhile, and in other ways I think it fed into it. I am now 22 years old. I still smoke regularly, feel extra anxiety if I don’t have weed on hand, and get quiet in social situations. It kills my motivation when I smoke during the day. I know I can do MORE with my life. I could be a better me without it. 
My mind though is stuck on the excuses. When I crave it or feel poorly I find a way to get it. I honestly feel like an addict with weed, and I am. 
I’m ready to let go of that identity. Any support appreciated!"

Weed made me so apathetic that I buried myself in debt and surrounded myself with toxic people.  I was having an INCREDIBLY FUN TIME BEING HIGH!  

But after several paranoid, sleepless nights, I finally found the courage inside me to make a positive, yet difficult life decision.  After 10 years of daily use, I’ve never felt better or more confident than I do today.  I’m genuinely enjoying my sobriety.

I cant take this anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f72cfn/i_cant_take_this_anymore/,2020-02-21 03:00:55,"I am so lost in this life.  I toked at 14 to cope with the abuse and the bullying. I was close to jump from a high building around that time. Just sat there looking down on the world that hated me so much. Smoked the first joint a few days after and found something that made my life simple. I could take the beatings and the horrible shit that was on the daily.

I found a way to survive, as long as i had weed i could manage. So life became about gathering for tomorrow and escape for today.

Somewhere around in my twenties i got jacked and hold at gun point at a time i was very high. I have never felt that afraid and the high just vaporized and stood clearheaded in panic. 

Few months after i started hearing voices.  Thoughts that was not mine, commands that i did not think. I quit cold turkey and spend 2 months isolated from ""friends"". Was very hard and horrible to go thru. 

8 months after i got clean more or less i had life under control.. Well more than i had in may years. Started a education, talked to a nice girl. Got away from my abusive mother and thought life was about to change.

It did. My spine had some kinda ticking time bomb illness so out of nothing i found myself with chronic pain.  I could not cope with the reality that i had fought that hard and went thru such withdrawals and horrible memories of the person i had become thru the weed and hate towards the world.

I lost my education chance, the girl was nothing i had thought and ended alone in apartment with no other than my abusive mother to help me.

I was never taught how to be out in the real world as my mom kept on fucking with my head thru narcissistic games, perversions and guilt to keep my head locked in some weird shit. Told me such horrible tales and lies and started fucking with every last piece of what i had left out in the real world.

Found myself in such a hole i could no longer take life. Could not sleep, could not maintain. So i toked..Just once. And just like that i got pulled in the escape again. I lost my mind and my will to live. I just wanted to die. 

So i took a chance and tried to kill myself. Got locked in an asylum and stuffed with various drugs that ended up frying my brain in such a way i haven't felt myself ever since. Went in and out of this horrible place a few times until i had enough.

Everything in my life was shit. I was around 200kg. Fat, fried and fucked.

Took up the fight and started loosing weight. Lost over 100 kg. Was winning again. Was gaining myself again.  Then my back got worse and all the shit was crawling thru the walls and i fell in the weed big time again.

Government fucked me over and let me rot on welfare as they did not want to help me so i just kept on sinking in the depression. Weed started to become the only reason to get up. The only reason to exist. As i just wanted to die. Years went by that way. Just stoned every day all day. I wanted to die.

So i got up again and fought my way out of the shit again. Quit the weed. Found my life spark again aaaand.. Just like that i got hit with nerve infection that caused me to feel pain i had no idea existed.

They put me on so high doses of morphine i fried my head even worse. I wanted to die again. I started toking mad again and just hazed thru the day. 

So few weeks ago i reached 40. Meaning i have been sick close to 18 years now. With nothing to show for it. I want to die. To get away from this shit..These few people that does nothing but get me drugs and keep me down.

Few weeks ago i finally find a connection with somebody and i start to feel again.  But i am a mess and i yet again must realize i do not fit anywhere in this world as i have been locked in this apartment for nearly half my life. World goes on..Very fast. She could not return the feelings i had.

I feel every time i toke i get paranoid now. Get these weird reality perspectives that i cant seem to place anywhere. I cant seem to find myself anymore.. What is real..what is paranoia.. What is anything anymore.

So i started to cut down on weed. And again every toke is causing my mind to fly right off in bad paranoia and feeling people are going to hurt me.. Did that car follow me.. 

I tried cold turkey but smoking that much for that long is causing withdrawals and pain to get worse so what ever i choose its fucking horrible.

I cut down over the last few weeks and i am 4 days sober today. I cant sleep. Pain is horrible.

Depression is hard atm and all these things i have been thru and mind games and sexual advanced from my mother is really messing up my head.

I cant take this shit no more. I just want this to end. 

What the fuck shall i do?. I am so far away from reality and myself

It is like every time i get close to something good my life just takes a turn for the worse.

Sorry for the text wall and thanks to whom ever reads this.

Cannabis might be a substance that most people can use without getting addicted; however, for a small percentage of people (roughly 9%), it can become really hard to quit. I appreciate the ""protection"" the cloud of cannabis offered me through my youth. But when I attempted to use it in moderation, I was always gradually drawn back into daily use. These repeated failed attempts at using in moderation continued for 10 years. During a weekend workshop (in which I had to be sober for 24 hours before and afterwards) I was finally able to see that my excessive cannabis use was keeping me timid and withdrawn. My circle stayed small, due to the fear of the unknown. I stayed ""self-medicated"" in that comfort bubble for too many years. 

I finally stopped altogether on July 22, 2006.

Re-found my joy for cooking.

Only ate healthy home cooked meals.

Fixed pretty much everything broken in my apartment. Got new furniture. Decorated my walls.

Meditated every day for 6 weeks.

Become much more productive at work (software developer) and found joy in developing my skills further.

I smoke all day. It's the first thing I do in the morning and the last thing I do before bed. I use it for chronic pain and to help keep me mellow. I'm a naturally angry person I use pot to help me cope with other people and I realize that's a huge problem, but it helped so much for so long that I'm terrified about who I will be without it. I'm looking into getting a therapist to help deal with that side of myself, but I digress. 

However much good it did me, it has done so much more to ruin more than one of my long term relationships. I just get so lazy and stop caring about the little things. I stopped helping out around the house and would neglect to do important things cause I decided to get stoned as soon as I woke up. I justified it as it being my way to relax unwind
 from the shitty jobs I've had, but it's gotten to the point where I do everything stoned.  

I have these huge dreams of owning my own recording studio, but I always find a way to stop myself and I think that's due to being so nonchalant all the time and not striving for more. 

I've lost the love of my life, with no way back, because of the consequences of smoking a plant and who it's turned me into. I would give anything to go back and never start smoking pot. 

Here's to Day 1.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your amazing words of encouragement. I am definitely doing this for me because I don't think I can take another heartbreak like this and it's the second long term relationship that my smoking had affected and I'm just ashamed it took me so long to see it. I wish her the best, but as much as I want to, I can't let myself think there's a chance. I get my expectations set so high, that when it doesn't work out I fall into deep depression which definitely won't help things now. I've got a sober tracker on my phone now and I'm going to do my best to check in regularly. Y'all are the greatest. Thank you so much."

I’ll tell you guys what though. Today I’m far more convinced I want to quit. And Im not gonna lie idk if I’ll ever be high again but something I realized when trying to abstain from smoking was that when I  gave in to smoke it didn’t feel the same anymore. 

It’s like if fighting it and not wanting it made me depressed for a whole different  reason. Not because I wasn’t high but because when I felt high it was like “this is what you were crying for really “ “this is it ?” I didn’t even feel relief like before when I mindlessly smoked. I didn’t enjoy that last high. I don’t want it anymore. 

I will be stronger. I will get over this. I will cry and I will hurt but this will all be over.

Techniques for regulating stress and anxiety when quiting cannabis.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f7s5st/techniques_for_regulating_stress_and_anxiety_when/,2020-02-22 15:52:10,"I wrote a quick comment on the question of a fellow leaver, which migth be helpfull to other members of this community. So I copy/paste it in this post:

&#x200B;

Hey, I'm a leaver and psychologist - psychotherapist that specialised in psychotraumatology.

Quiting weed often disturbes the neurological inhibition and stress regulating systems. The brains are accustomed to quite a massive inhibition from using weed, so the normal regulation is disturbed. Leaving weed behind initially forces your brain to auto-regulate again and reach a new balance. Initially this seems to cause a further imbalance. This is paired with a hightened stress reaction that comes with stopping an addiction.

Therapeutically, I usually aim at stabilising my cliënts and learn them to stabilise themselves. There are multiple  techniques and self-soothing skills that you can aquire on yourself, to prevent or attenuate the normal reactions you now have.

Classic and well know are breathing techniques. A good, slow, deep ventral breathing can allready help a lot. A specific technique is called heart-coherence. This kind off breathing synchronises your breathing pattern and the fluctuations in your heartbeat/-rate. This improves the connection between your symathic and parasympatisc neuronal systems (i.c. the neocortex and your 'reptile brain'). This allows your brain to auto-regulate your emotional systems by your frontal cortical system. The disruption due to stress and a disturbed inhibition system that causes anxiety and  depersonalisation can be prevented or diminished this way. Practicing heart coherence for 5 minutes improves this connection up to 4 hours. Training this regularly (30 minutes a day for a month) even lets this coherence to become a new habit so you experience this continually.

There are mobile apps you can use for this. There are some which offer auto-feedback due to heart-rate monitoring. Some use the flashlight of your smartphone to monitor bloodflow in your fingertip. You can also use apps that just propose a breathing frequency that fits most people, they work well too. An alternative is just to put up a youtube video for heart coherence. Most applications let you breath in when a ball goes up and breath out when a ball goes down. Using deep ventrical breathing is not required but can improve the effects in my experience.

Other than that, there are a lot of normal healthy habbits that can help regulate tension. Walking, being attentive to nature arround you, a good hydratation, the company of a good friend...

Good luck on your journey. It's not about winning, it's about learning and finding a new way to live life that suits you best."
"If you're back to day one, read this, it might help",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ess4mf/if_youre_back_to_day_one_read_this_it_might_help/,2020-01-23 15:02:05,"We learn something from every attempt to quit, it's not a failure as such but a learning curve. Instead of thinking 'I've failed, this is day one again', look at the percentage of time you managed to go without. Being without 99% of the time is better than smoking everyday. 99% better

Personally I don't believe in counting the days as it's something that draws us back to the thought of 'I can't have it'. A better narrative is ""I don't smoke weed"". Using can't requires will power, replacing with don't requires no will power at all. 

An even better narrative is 'I'm living a healthy and productive life"" and remove all thoughts of weed completely

The first hundred time I tried to quit I was weak and let myself go “just one more day”. Upon recently finding out my third child is on the way, I told myself I need to do better things with my life and recognized that weed has been severely holding me back. My house has been “lived in” (my way of excusing the mess caused by me being lazy) for as long as I can remember, never dirty but unfolded laundry in baskets and dishes in the sink most of the time. I spent a time throughout the day tackling small jobs around the house, each one giving me motivation to start on another. Once my laundry pile was almost finished, I looked around and could see an empty sink, clean bedroom with my bed made, and almost all of the toys in the house picked up, and a sudden rush of endorphins came over me. For the first time in a long time my body gave me a huge dopamine hit from feeling accomplished, even when I would have a clean house in the past I was too stoned to feel anything other than tired and ready to smoke another bowl. I don’t want to call this a high for what I feel are obvious reasons, but this feeling is amazing and wanted to share my experience here with y’all. 

TLDR: I got my first endorphin rush from cleaning my house today, never felt so good from something that was typically a chore when I was using!"

I was so scared taking time off work for my mental health would ruin my career that's just starting. I even felt okay that if it was a rejection call I would handle it well. 

I used casual sex and weed to escape my pain, and now I face it head on and I feel so strong and purposeful.

I know theres going to be more trying times. If I get this role I will be in a very male dominated environment, some people may even smoke to release stress. 

My parents still have there struggles, and my brother still tries me with his issues. But this year I am focused completely on me. My happiness and career is my focus, I can think about dating again when I have created a beautiful life for myself.

5 years without weed and just found this sub! / AMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dxlwu1/5_years_without_weed_and_just_found_this_sub_ama/,2019-11-17 15:20:56,"I'm a 26 year old guy in the UK.

After (nearly) 5 years of clean time two things are true - my life is immeasurably better and I still think about smoking weed almost daily.

Finding this sub is amazing; I haven't been to a group or meeting in years and didn't realise how much I missed the peer support.

I took drugs from the age of about 16 and after years of abuse this culminated in a few episodes of drug induced psychosis and residential care at an addiction treatment centre. 

Weed was always there, every, single, day. It was the last thing to go back in December of 2014. 

2015 was the worst year of my life. I had no idea what to do with myself, how to sleep, how to eat, how to spend time with friends, how to regulate anxiety and why did music suddenly sound so boring? But there were some silver linings...

I didn't have to worry about running out of weed, I didn't have to wait for unreliable dealers, I could be around my family without them being scared of me, everything became much much simpler.

Over the next four years every single element of my life has improved. My relationships are better, I'm more confident, I go to the gym and have a good job. I'm closer with my family than ever. I eat well, rather than having only one meal a day which is invariably a greasy takeaway. I can hang out with friends when I want and on my terms - without being that weird dude on the periphery that pops outside every couple of hours to smoke. People experience me as a much better person to be around. Also music sounds good again.

Getting free of weed is a fucking tough journey. And it's going to be horrible for a while. Just hang on to those silver linings and enjoy being free of all of the trappings of active addiction. Once you break the back of it everything will improve.

I thought people towards the beginning of their journey may have questions, which I'm more than happy to answer!

Love to you all - the world is a much brighter place once you win your battle!"

"""If you're this stressed out about whether or not you should smoke, it's probably not a good idea."" Wise words from my wife.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/a8ref3/if_youre_this_stressed_out_about_whether_or_not/,2018-12-23 06:23:42,"Long context: went through heavy pot-head phases in my twenties. Stopped buying for good around 27 but frequently smoked with friends. I really fucking like being high.

Now early 30s. Stopped altogether when my daughter was born. Didn't want to be high around her for many (hopefully obvious?) reasons. 

So I made it two years and didn't socialize much being a new dad and all so avoiding it wasn't super hard. Then a few months ago I played video games with a group of friends who always smoke. I decided the risks of smoking were minimal. Smoked. Played games, messed around on friend's DJ equipment. Not gonna lie, it was a blast. 

BUT... When I got in my car I was like fuck I'm dumb. I forgot how tense driving high could be for me (friend lives in a narrow street cars parked on both sides neighborhood) and what if I'm in an accident, even if it's not my fault I'm potentially really fucking up my life. Also we had new management at work and what if they drug tested? It happened at my wife's company! Also what if my daughter is randomly sick and I'm stoned for that?! I just felt so dumb that I put my desire to have fun over the security of this amazing life I have. Nothing bad ended up happening but I felt like a bad dad for even tempting fate like that.

So fast forward to another party a month later. This time wife is with me and is sober and drove, and our kid is with with the grandparents for the weekend, so less reasons against smoking.  Our friend alludes to the fact that he's gonna be smoking weed on the porch soon and my heart seriously pounds. I wanted it so bad but I knew I'd feel dumb for doing so later. I'd just annoy my wife with my high behavior, stay up too late eating junk food, and then I basically would be an occasional smoker which, knowing my history, could lead me back to stoner territory. 

We left pretty soon anyway and I walked right past the smoker on the porch trying not to think about that enticing smell. I vented my anxiety about it to my wife in the car and that's when she wisely said, ""If you're this worried about whether or not you should smoke, it's probably not a good idea.""  

Thanks for reading; it's been on my mind for a while. I guess this is a ""relapse"" but I'm done beating myself up about it.  Weed is not an option for me anymore. Period. Done. It's like an allergy. 

It is hard but you can do it too. You are stronger than a plant!

Edit to clarify: when my wife said this I wasn't just saying what a bad idea smoking was, I was also saying how it wouldn't really hurt anything and in this instance was pretty low risk. I was bargaining with myself because the urge for that strange giddiness weed gives me (the vacation from my default self) was and will probably always be strong.

I'm happy people say my story helped. Remember to fast forward the tape before your next puff. How will you feel after the initial ""fix?"" "

Weed Is Not Good Or Bad,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/avbl5v/weed_is_not_good_or_bad/,2019-02-27 12:27:14,"Hi I'm new to posting. I've been trying to quit weed for about a year now and today my therapist dropped some knowledge on me that I thought I would share. When I'm about to decide if I'm going to smoke, I hear a voice in my head that says something like ""You know, you really shouldn't do that. You really should go do something productive instead."" Well today I realized why that voice doesn't work. 

There is no ""what I should do"". There is only what I want to do. Deciding to smoke weed is not an objectively good or bad choice, it is either an effective or an ineffective choice. What is my goal? To have a stable career in the near future? Then weed is not a very effective choice to get me there. But if my goal is to get high, then catching up on reading is not the effective choice. 

When I felt an urge to smoke this afternoon I asked myself what I wanted. The answer was I wanted to stop feeling overwhelmed by my responsibilities. Getting high would temporarily allow me to escape that feeling, but long term it would have only made things worse. The more effective choice was crossing a few more small things off my to-do list, and turning in early so I could actually wake up tomorrow feeling well-rested. It's crazy how much pride I felt after making that decision. 

The problem with classifying weed as a ""bad"" choice, is it invokes a 3rd party arbiter of right and wrong. Who is this 3rd party that has decided weed is bad? Society? My parents? God? Sounds exactly like the type of people I LOVE to rebel against. I'm actually the type of person who gets pleasure from doing the ""wrong"" thing, and still making it work. 

What I realized today is quitting weed is my decision, it's a choice I want to make, for the future I want to have. I think this motivation will last me a lot longer, because I trust myself more than anyone. All I have to do is be honest with myself. Is this choice leading me to where I want to go?

Good luck y'all. "

At first it was a way to wind down after work and after my son (now 9) was in bed. It was away of coping with the end of my marriage too. But it has turned into something completely different.

I now smoke when I wake up, before going to work, after work, sometimes in the middle of the day if I am home. I smoke before doing housework (toking and cleaning used to be so much fun), before cooking meals, before bed... You get the picture. I am what some would call a  functionning pot head.

I have realized that my relationship with cannabis is not healthy. It controls me and it has negatively impacted my life. So yesterday, I threw everything out. 1/4 oz, my pipe, papers, etc. 

My main motivator is my son. I don't want him to take it up. He's so smart and has so much potential. I want to protect that beautiful mind and I want to be an example to him. 

I am apprehensive about quitting over the Holidays, but I would like to start 2020 with a clear(-er) mind. Plus, there will always be a good reason not to quit now.

3 months sober from weed. What I've learned,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cqr3bi/3_months_sober_from_weed_what_ive_learned/,2019-08-15 19:08:20,"Smoking multiple times a day can be just as bad for your mentality as any other hard drug. ""Weed isn't addictive"" every addicted stoner says. Some people can handle weed and that's fine. But most people cannot. It's not the worst addiction to have, but when it cuts into your funds, kills your motivation to do anything but smoke, and makes you paranoid and anxious 24/7, then it's just as bad as any other hard drug. Just because you won't die from it or experience physical harm doesn't mean it can't hurt you mentally as much as other harder drugs."
Your Thoughts Are Repeatedly The Same When Smoking.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/chx0al/your_thoughts_are_repeatedly_the_same_when_smoking/,2019-07-26 06:20:21,"Day 7 and I've noticed finally a HUGE benefit. 

My thoughts for the first time in years are not a repeat of the same bullshit. 

I remember reading, thoughts are formed by neurons firing electrical signals to each other. However neurons tire out quickly and need to cool off. So your neurons take turns stepping up to the plate and firing away for some time before resting, and when rested neurons return to fire away you get new thoughts.

The problem is when you smoke weed your neurons never rest. Weed keeps your neurons firing and firing. It's literally frying your brain but more so trapping you in a loop of the same bullshit thoughts. 

I can finally say I have a still mind. For example, before if I had something to do I'd think about it for hours and days repeatedly,  which just created procrastination. Now I've noticed I don't think about pending things anymore and just do them because I'm not trapped in a constant loop of thinking about the same thing I need to do for weeks.

When you first broke up, oh boy did it sting, and suddenly all you could think about was every single positive thing that happened and suddenly they were an angel walking on earth that did nothing bad to you. 

Then, some times goes by, a few weeks... months... and eventually you realise not only are you fine, and happy again.. but realise that you were not meant to be with that person - clearly otherwise you wouldn’t have split up.

Of course this doesn’t correlate in every aspect, especially if you got dumped, but if you got dumped then that person wasn’t the one and you’ve had to deal with it and move on.

Weed is like a comfortable but not healthy relationship, where you’re clouded by the positives and ignore the negatives. Try and remember any negative feelings or experiences you had whilst smoking weed and use that as motivation to stop. 

For me, I can remember being paranoid that I was doing things to hurt my friends, or even just making up crazy scenarios of how anything in my life could go wrong. I also remember the times where after a long night of smoking, I would feel so incredibly ill, my throat would feel all closed up and tight.. and I’d wonder why I’d bothered getting so stoned - yet go back to it the next day.

Think of your wallet!!! I’ve realised over ~5 years smoking that I’d spent close to £25,000 on weed - and not to mention the silly amount I’ve spent on food at the same time.

Remember the times before you got into smoking and remember that there is a version of yourself that doesn’t need to be high.

Big love."

I was an escapist to the max. I needed to be intoxicated at all times, and when I would start to slip in to sobriety, I would need to be intoxicated again. I was scared of being sober. I was a slave to marijuana. 

Now I see that the *only* way I can handle life is in sobriety. The only way I can go to bed on time and wake up on time and do my school work and be accountable and honest and true to myself and not hurt people all the damn time and to handle minor inconveniences without freaking out is by being sober. 

Sobriety has granted me a serenity that I could have only dreamed of. The kind of serenity that I thought only cannabis could give me. 

I used to smoke because I didn't like myself sober. I thought I was too loud, too annoying, too human. So I would smoke that away to dull myself into a zombie. 

I don't like zombie me anymore.

I love sober me. "

Two years!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dv8nfe/two_years/,2019-11-12 14:20:54,"I'm sober for 2 years today. I can't believe how much my life improved.

I'm no longer obese, I've lost 24 kg (53 lbs) in those 2 years. My health improved exponentially, so did my mood and overall feeling about life.

I'm no longer sedentary, lingering in the couch like I was before. I became a strong swimmer and a bodysurfer. I ride pretty nice waves and I'm having the time of my life. I travel to the beach almost every week in order to seek that awesome feeling, this is what drives me now.

During the week I swim, lift weights sometimes, walk the dog, diet hard, everything in order to bodysurf better, always thinking about the next session in the sea. 

I've never had this kind of drive in my life, pot had stolen all my dreams and goals, I used to just want to smoke and sit in the couch, play videogames and eat, it was really depressing.

I've recently even found a way to not hate my job, that's not an easy task, I don't exactly like to work, but I guess now I see thing from a practical perspective. I feel like a full grown adult for the first time in my life. Life is not all joy and comfort, it's struggling and survival, and it's a privilege to have some hapiness in between all the struggle.

I could say I'm a completely different person now, but I'm pretty much the same guy, just an improved version of the same guy. My wife couldn't be happier about it, and it makes me proud to have been able to be better for her.

Recovery made me feel proud about myself in life, with a feeling of accomplishment and peace.

I hope everyone can find this peace in recovery, and I'm here for you if you need me.

Thanks for reading, stay strong!"

The problem is that I’m not living any life while I’m stoned. I sit on my couch and watch the same shows I’ve watched over and over again because I know the plot and I don’t have to pay attention. I time my edible on my drive home to hit me as I’m taking the dogs out.

Since I quit, my life has been amazing. It took a few months but I got the job I've always wanted.

I wouldn't have even made the effort to meet someone if I were still stoned all the time and the idea of hoping he'd accept me if I were still reeking of pot and needed to bring my bong and baggies to his place every time I went there is cringeworthy.

First and foremost, it's great to have you here and I'm glad you decided to come to see what we're about. 

Since how we act towards each other is the only thing that makes this place as special as it is I just wanted to take an opportunity for some reminders for newcomers and old-timers alike.

**Who We Are**

This is a subreddit for people intending to quit or trying to figure out whether they should.  The only people we're not suited for are people who have the intention to continue smoking or return to smoking.  

That includes moderation management, tolerance breaks, ""I just need to get away from it for a while,"" or ""I need help getting through the next few months while my dealer's on vacation.""

It's hard for people trying to quit for good to have discussions with people who are still smoking or intending to start again, so we keep our focus pretty narrow.

**Who We Are Not**

The thing that sets /r/leaves apart from most of the other subreddits is that people come here at what is often the worst time in their lives.  They feel bad and have little love for the world or anyone in it.

So one of the few rules we very firmly enforce is that we are a *support* community.  We are here to help each other, creating an accepting community and a welcome place to be.  I know the rest of reddit can be rough-and-tumble, but that ends at the /r/leaves front door.

Even if you disagree with someone, if you are rude, dismissive, or any other flavor of impatient we will moderate your posts or comments out, and if you make a habit of it we will ban you.  

If you cannot find a supportive way to communicate with people, find a way to disagree with them in a respectful way, or guide people with what you think are wrong ideas in a gentle and understanding way, then you should not comment.

**Dealing With Problems**

If someone is trolling, seems to have missed the point of the group, is soapboxing in a way contrary to our mission, or anything else that might tick you off, **do not comment, and use the report button.**  That brings it to the mods' attention where we can review it. Use the report button early and often, it's really a help.

Again, however, please don't comment.  That just gives trolls more opportunities to keep trolling.

To keep modding from being too crazy we use Automod keyword filters that automatically holds posts relating to some topics for review by the mods.  We review every single Automodded post, but sometimes we can mess up, so if you aren't seeing your post and think it's somehow stuck feel free to message the mods.

**How /r/leaves Works Best**

The point of /r/leaves is many helping one and one helping many.  I know it's tempting to be a lurker, but unless we share our experience then no one has any lessons to learn.

Please post often and comment often.  Just the process of writing out your posts helps you and posting them helps others.  

We now get over **100,000** unique users a month here at /r/leaves so even a small participation can help a whole lot of people.

Thanks very much for arriving here, and we look forward to seeing your progress posts and great stories ahead.

The Weed Routine,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f4ri9c/the_weed_routine/,2020-02-16 17:43:05," Weed works its way into people’s lives in different ways. Take this example:

*Here’s how my life has gone for the past 7 years. Get home as quickly as possible. Light up a bowl soon after I walk in the door to get high. Pet the dog, feed him, then walk him (after I’ve taken a few more hits, and feel sufficiently high). Turn on the TV and crash. Order in, or cook something simple from the kitchen. Avoid my parent’s phone calls. Get high some more, browse my social media before falling asleep sometime after midnight. Wake up feeling agitated and get ready for work, wishing I could stay home and get high all day. Repeat.*

For this person, weed integrated itself as an essential part of their day. Weed is greedy—it’s not satisfied to take up just the time when you’re getting high. It makes you rush through your other activities, just so you can slow down and enjoy the high. Except when you look back, it’s difficult to see whether you were enjoying anything at all. 

When you’re high every day, it’s hard to be fully yourself, because you’re not your original best self - you’re your high self. Like a crappy knock-off, you’re a diminished version of yourself.

This isn’t the case for everyone, though. For some people, being high every day isn’t a reality they have to worry about. But it can still overwhelm your routine. Take this example:

*I’ve managed to stay away from weed during the weekdays since I can tell it affects me at my job. I mostly keep to it on the weekends, which is a great way to unwind after a stressful week. However, after a few weeks of this, I’ve noticed some things changing. I don’t see the people I used to meet up with for a beer. I’ll get the invite, but when I look outside and see it’s snowing, I just want to sit at home and unwind with a bowl. I used to invite my friends over - the ones who liked to smoke - but over time, and after being rejected, it’s just easier to do it on my own. My weekends are spent getting high - and although I put off working out, cleaning the house, or reading for my weekends - when I start smoking, it’s hard not to keep doing it.*

For this person, weed worked its way into their routine, even when it wasn’t a daily activity. Their weekends were built around weed; and even though this person knew that more needed to be done, weed took precedence.

It’s easy to build weed into your routine. The benefits are clear: had a rough day / week / conversation? Weed can help bring you back to happiness. Over time, it becomes the preferred method for calming down. It makes everything better: TV, music, art. Until it becomes the standard requirement for us to enjoy these activities. Soon, TV and music simply don’t have the same pizzazz without getting high first. The TV shows we enjoyed while we are high simply aren’t as funny or engaging when we watch them without weed. Art, which was a great way to exercise our creative energy, suddenly seems daunting and scary without weed.

Over time, you customize your body to expect the satisfaction that comes with weed. This is the beginning stage of addiction. Without it, you revert to irritability, anger, or boredom. It becomes easier to exist at 50% of one’s potential because weed makes you ok with being bored. Doing more becomes difficult because after weed works its way into your routine, it’s hard to remember how you go by without it."
"Just found this sub, and feeling conflicted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/d0ihan/just_found_this_sub_and_feeling_conflicted/,2019-09-06 19:52:03,"A popular askreddit thread led me here today, and now I'm having an existential crisis.  I was planning on just lurking for a while, but that seems to be pretty discouraged here, so I decided to make this post, to try and get some guidance.  
  
I've been a daily smoker for over 15 years now.  I've always had it in the back of my mind that this wasn't doing me any favors, but I would always put that thought away, and call up my dealer.  It wasn't so bad when it was still illegal, as my guy would blow me off sometimes, or not have anything at the moment.  But last year, my state went medically legal, and of course I got my license as soon as I possibly could.  This has not been a good thing for me.  I always make sure bills are paid, and my family has everything they need, but I will always spend any extra money I have at the dispensary.  I'll even say to myself that I should probably wait until payday, but my ""demon"" side almost always wins, and I end up at the dispensary again.  
  
Like I said, family and bills come first, and I make sure those are taken care of before I get smoke, but I feel like I'd have so much more money in the savings account if I could just stop buying the shit.  
  
After reading some posts on here, it did come in to my head that maybe I'm not where I want to be in life.  I have a pretty good paying job in the career field I chose, but I could probably be in a much higher position (no pun intended) if I did something more productive with my time than hitting the bong.  Then I got to thinking about my son.  How many good times and memories have I missed out with him, because I'd rather be smoking a joint in the garage then spending time with him?  He's only 7, so I feel like I really need to get my shit together, or he's going to grow up to resent me because I liked smoking more than him.  
  
I really don't know where I'm going with this post as I feel like I'm just rambling.  The fact that I'm here writing this means some part of me wants to stop. Right?"
I quit for 7 months and was sure that I was free... oh how I was wrong [Reminder to stay Viligent!],https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ceb2tb/i_quit_for_7_months_and_was_sure_that_i_was_free/,2019-07-17 14:33:10,"I was pretty active over here - I was 23, had been smoking since I was 17, and had an all-day every-day habit since for six years. What made me quit? I had a trainwreck of an evening when smoking. The next day I had to give an important presentation to PhD Researchers, and I could not handle the anxiety I felt, knowing that I was ill prepared and smoking weed instead. I contacted the relevant people, told them that I was not mentally well, and vowed to get my shit together and never smoke weed again. That's what happened - for a while. I did indeed get my shit together, I removed weed from my life and was so much happier sober. Everything improved. 

It wasn't until about 7 months later that it went to shit again. I was having a music session around my place, me and some friends were making music and having some beers. By this point I had become over-confident and would happily hang around weed smokers, sometimes I would actively choose to go and stand around people smoking weed just to prove a point to myself, to demonstrate my will-power. Anyway, this guy at my place was smoking a joint, he even told me he would be happy to smoke outside as he was aware of my situation. I said no it's fine, and having a few beers in me, started this classic and cringe worthy thing of 'Well it has been 7 months, I think I deserve a cheeky puff'. My friend tried to talk me out of it but being a massive stoner himself, it did not take him long to be talked around to giving me the joint. 

The thing that scares me the most is there was an instant change in my that, in hindsight, confirms to me that I am a sucker for this stuff... an addict, dependent, whatever you want to call it. But as soon as I'd had a few puffs, my friend went home. The three puffs weren't enough - I had got a taste for it, and I wanted more. Almost immediately I phoned my old dealer for a 3.5. It had been 7 months, I expected him to be like 'Oh my godddd man where have you been, I missed you sooo much' or whatever. No, he didnt even notice I was gone. This is going off track a bit but just remember that your weed dealer makes a lot of money from you... just because he acts like your friend does not mean he has your best interests in mind, don't get attached. 

That night, as I said I called my dealer for a 3.5. The maddest thing is I even ran down to the 24/7 garage and bought 30g of tobacco! By this point I had quit cigarettes for 3 months as well, and I happily threw this down the toilet. 

By now it must be pretty obvious what happened... I rolled a joint, which turned into several joints and cigarettes, which turned into more joints and cigarettes, which brought me to 7 months later, right now... feeling depressed, unmotivated, lethargic, lonely and regretful again.

My biggest problem with weed is the wasting of time. I have always been one for a bit of an existential crisis... if a quarter-life crisis exists, I am having one, and I imagine I will be a sucker for a mid-life crisis in the future. Age upsets me, I get attached to the idea that I have so much potential but I am wasting it with weed. It hurts me thinking what I could have become by now if I never had picked up weed. But who the fuck knows, maybe it's all part of the journey... 

Anyway, the main point I wanted to express right now is that you should never stop being vigilent. After 7 months I was sure that I was over this, yet it inevitably brought me back to the exact same point that I was experiencing the previous year. 

Don't get over confident, stay vigilent, and always remember why you are doing this."

Your symptoms are your 'fake friends',https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/72qgl3/your_symptoms_are_your_fake_friends/,2017-09-27 10:20:13,"Depression, Anxiety, No Appetite, Brain Fog, Insomnia, Nausea, Cold Sweats: theyre all your closest buddies right now. They smoke all your weed with you and never contribute anything positive to your life. Everyday, theyre right there with you, smoking all your shit. They never want to leave because you constantly have it. When you dont have it or dont smoke it, theyre up your ass, making you feel like shit for it. Why? Because they dont give a fuck about you, they just want to get high and eat all your food and watch shitty movies and shows on TV with you. But hey, you dont care, youre just happy to make others happy, so you keep on smoking to keep your friends around.

Then comes the day you decide to finally quit weed, and they cant seem to stop harassing you about it.
""What the fuck man why arent we getting high right now?""
""Come on lets chill dude!""
""Dont be such a pussy weed isnt addictive youre just being a bitch about it!""
theyll say to you. When they notice you havent smoked for a few weeks, No Appetite, Cold Sweats, Nausea and Insomnia get up and leave. What a relief, three assholes out of your life for good, thank god, you always knew they were such dicks.

Then theres Depression, Anxiety, and Brain Fog, the three others who still hang around because they believe that if they play their cards right they can get you to start smoking again.

They know theres someone in there that will give in to temptation. Theyll try to remind you of it every now and then. Theyll make you think about all the good times you guys had getting high back in the day. Theyll even stick up for the assholes who left you a while back, claiming that you were the problem, not them. God damn, these guys are hard to ignore. But maybe they know whats best for you, after all, theyve stuck around the longest.

Part of you wants to smoke again just to stop them from prying at your emotions, and another part of you wants them out of your life for good. So you continue on without smoking, yet they keep on setting you up for failure. After having a bad day, they tell you ""Hey, if you do it every once in a while, its not so bad.""

You dont disagree, and you figure its been a while, so why not? You smoke and before you know it, youre back to smoking every damn day again. Back sitting on the couch, surrounded by all the fuckers who ditched you at the drop of a pin, just wasting the time away getting high. But now you cant stop thinking about how much you fucked up by relapsing just that one time. You realize how much Depression, Anxiety, and Brain Fog got to you.

You quit again, and the same thing happens as last time, the same four assholes leave within a few weeks, and the other three stick right by your side.

This time around, you know the games they play, so youre prepared.

They dont get to you much at all this time, because youre distracting yourself with hobbies, making new friends, achieving your goals and spending all that extra money you earn on better things instead of weed.

As each day passes, they become less and less clingy, and start to lose hope in getting you to smoke again. Eventually, Depression, Anxiety, and Brain Fog finally agree to say ""fuck this, youre a lost cause"" and leave you alone, and this time, its for good.

You did it, it took you a long ass time but you got rid of all those negative influences in your life and replaced them with positive people and things. They tried to stop you in your path but you stuck to your guns and did it. Now, a year later, youre glad that you quit weed and wouldnt trade it for anything in the world.

How push ups helped me overcome weed addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g9eqka/how_push_ups_helped_me_overcome_weed_addiction/,2020-04-28 06:21:48,"Greetings from the heart to everyone,

I hope you are coping well with the current situation, and that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.

I would like to share with you my experience of how I overcame my addiction to smoking weed daily.

Now please don't get me wrong, I believe some people can enjoy smoking weed in moderate levels. 

I believe it's all about self-awarenes, I used to run away from my life problems and issues by smoking it because it helped me to relax and forget about everything (just while being high).

I started to consume more and more to reach the high level that I needed and here is where I have realized.... there is a problem.

I have tried many methods to stop, which worked for a while, but in no time I was smoking again.
 
Until I came up with my own method.

First, you need to truly commit that you will do whatever it takes to STOP and that you will not lie to yourself.

Every time your brain starts thinking about that addiction (weed in my case) and how nice and relaxing it is use the Mel Robinns 5 second rule (if you don't know it check it on YT) and immediately do push-ups (as much as you can) until your muscles can't hold you anymore.

Now let me explain this so it will make sense to you. 
You see our brains are created to protect us, to makes us feel comfortable and happy, therefore it will always remind you of the things you felt good about.

Let's take here as example relationships and breakups... why do you think you feel miserable and you miss your Ex so much? 

Because your brain can tell that currently, you are feeling sad, but it doesn't recognize the reason, it only knows that it's linked with your Ex, so it will start memorizing all the good times all the moments that you shared together (the happy ones ofcourse) which will make you miss her/him more.

Our brains don't recognize that it's bringing us more pain than pleasure.

Sounds stupid right? But the brain did that to protect us from sad feelings without knowing that it makes things worse for us.
 
That's why YOU NEED TO steer, control, manipulate (whatever you want to call it) your mind (brain) for your advantage.
If you let it work on autopilot it will destroy you.

NOW, when your brain is thinking about that specific addiction and you start doing push-ups (any kind of exercise, Plank is also good) by repeating that, your brain will link that addiction (which felt great before) with PAIN! negative emotion.

Make sense now? 

When you repeat that everytime you think of it (for at least 2 weeks), trust me your brain will not remind you of that addiction no matter what, and you suddenly will feel greater willpower.
Because again your brain is designed to make you feel good, and pain will make your brain avoid that in any cause.
You see when you go to the gym you are pushing your limits, you are getting out of your comfort zone, that's why in the begging your brain will resist it until you start to see actual physical results which takes time.
On the other hand drugs, alcohol, porn and masturbation will provide you the same feeling, but in a faster way.

Once you master it, you will feel great about your accomplishment.

I hope some of you will find that beneficial and I wish you all good luck.🍀"
"To anyone who's successfully quit and gets a thought of 'just treat yourself', it is the addiction speaking, it is NOT worth it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ewq91i/to_anyone_whos_successfully_quit_and_gets_a/,2020-01-31 18:44:11,"I've been here so many times. So many 'I feel lost' posts, so many 'I need help' posts. It took years for me to finally cut the addiction and stop daily smoking.

But recovering also meant a lot of other things revealed themself. Yes I started being a TONNE more productive, eating better, lost lots of weight. But I still wasn't happy... life was still dull and grey, a hole which I thought weed used to solve.

3 days ago, I hit a rough spot. I'm on new antidepressants which take a long time to 'take effect', and during those few months where they are getting into your system, it's not uncommon for your emotions and stability to be going up and down repeatedly. I had been free of the addiction for a good while, and thought I truly had got my control in life back. I was wrong.

I woke up one day after a night of heavy, heavy drinking. Drank so much I don't even remember the night. I didn't wake up feeling hungover, but I woke up feeling INCREDIBLY paranoid, depressed, anxious. Obviously this was all because of the alcohol, but I had a creeping thought of smoking, knowing it would make me feel better about things and stop worrying. At first I took note of it and ignored it, but through the day I just had this feeling that it was inevitable. And then later on my friend was picking up and I just caved, which has turned into me doing nothing for 3 days and spending way too much money on takeaways and snacks.

The whole time I've known this is bad and that I shouldn't do it, but I wake up and feel so terrible until I've smoked again, something I hadn't felt in a while. I'm smoking this to hold myself accountable and hope tomorrow I can get back to how I was, gonna be hard though."
Quitting feels like heartbreak.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/etq37f/quitting_feels_like_heartbreak/,2020-01-25 15:14:49,"I'm currently on day 25 and came to a realisation a couple of days ago but wanted to sit on the idea before sharing it:

Personally, the best example I can give (other than just saying I feel anxious and depressed) is that I feel heartbroken. When a relationship breaks down with someone, or when a family member passes or a much loved pet, that sickening feeling your body feels when trying to adjust to the situation is somewhat identical to the feeling of no longer having weed in your life.

Weed was that warm hug when you were sad, the thing that got you out of bed in the morning, the thing that made social situations that much more enjoyable; it gave you a reason to be happy and it was a feeling you're constantly chasing... somewhat the exact feelings you would get when you're ""in-love"". You had a bad day? Your loved ones would be your go-to, the same way weed was my go-to.

I could be put in the most horrible, awkward situations but as long as I had my weed, the same way a young child needs their mother or father, the feeling becomes less scary. Now you're no longer smoking, you're going through the heartbreak of losing something you love. The more addicted you were, the longer it'll take for your heart and body to mend and adjust to the new lifestyle of living ""single"", or free from weed in this case.

If you're reading this and think I'm chatting absolute shit then you're probably right, but in my mind, it makes total sense. I've had girlfriends in the past that I loved (I might not have been IN-LOVE with them but I loved them for sure) and the gut-wrenching feelings I would have when these relationships broke down are somewhat identical to the feelings I'm now experiencing now I'm sober.

Your body and mind are mending, and you're in complete control over what direction you want to go in with it. These things can take weeks, months or years, and there's no shame in taking longer than others. You'll mend when you're meant to mend. Sending love to everyone and hope you have a strong, fulfilled and happy weekend, no matter what you're currently going through."

I've been cold turkey for exactly 1 year today. No more cravings, don't even think about weed unless I see it on Facebook or reddit somehow. I have improved personally and professionally more in the last year than I did in 5 years whilst smoking. I increased my income by $15,000pa and am now on my way to saving for a house. I read books, I work out and I feel I am on the path to creating a successful life.

But by far my favourite improvement has been this overall feeling of being free from the habit of daily smoking.

I no longer feel like I have to smoke before certain activities. I don't need to plan my life around when I'm sober enough to drive or get things over with so I can spend the entire day getting high.

I don't feel as ""weighed down"". It's so nice to just be able to get up and go about my day and enjoy being out somewhere for a few hours instead of being anxious wondering how soon until I can smoke again. 

It is still in the back of my mind often, but I don't crave it the way I did in the beginning.

Insights from 23 years of being high,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9bmhs8/insights_from_23_years_of_being_high/,2018-08-30 23:01:41,"I felt compelled to share some things as it seems many of the people here in this sub are still quite young and struggling with weed use. I’m 42 now so I’m on the other side so to speak. I didn’t have the reason or the will to ever quit weed until recently and I’m realizing how much damage it actually did to my life in the background.

I have kids. A house. A spouse who loves me. A career. I workout regularly. I take nice vacations every year and travel for work. From the outside my life seems pretty great. But after only 2 weeks sober I am facing some pretty tragic realities that have been sitting right in front of me all along.

I used to pride myself on being able to have both “accomplishments” and a daily weed habit. Until now.

What I’m realizing now that I took weed out of my brain for a short couple of weeks is that it has damaged me in really serious ways. I have deep-rooted black and white thinking that hurts me and others repeatedly in my job and in my marriage. I have guilt for being high around my kids that I used to gloss over with smoke because “hey, I don’t have a problem, right?” I have dramatic self loathing that seeps into every aspect of my life.

Bottom line, I have “woken up” after 23 years of chronic smoking to a pile of regret. Remember those dreams I used to have about my career? Things I once reached for that I long since let go of. I chose weed so many times in my life over doing the work. I chose to get high instead of work on my marriage. I chose to get high instead really spend time with my kids. I chose to get high instead of taking creative risks. I chose to get high instead of starting my own business. I chose to get high instead of calling my mom. I chose to get high and basically do the bare minimum of what was expected of me.

And now I deeply regret all the time lost.

So if you are reading this and thinking you may have a problem with weed or feel like you want to quit. Please do your middle aged self a favor and reach deep within for the willpower. Trust me you don’t want to wake up in 20 years and realize you had a glaring problem in your life all along. Life is short. And although mine’s not been truly wrecked by weed. I feel like I let it steal too many important things from me. I’m finally done. Now I just hope I can repair my brain and my emotions and my ambitions and relationships before any more time slips by.

Best to all of you."

Don't be The Stoner,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/23smra/dont_be_the_stoner/,2014-04-23 23:55:59,"After about 6 years of smoking everyday I've decided to quit. I'm only on day 3, but things are becoming very clear to me. I have let Marijuana define me as a person. 

I was always the ""high guy"" in the group. My ""friends"" would call me to smoke at my place because I had a bong. My birthday presents were always marijuana paraphernalia and Rasta oriented items. Whenever I would miss a social gathering or a planned activity people would just assume that I was off getting high. The world perceives the image that you choose to project, and my image was unfortunately that of a post-college burnout. 

The lowest point of my addiction came when I was fired from my menial job for being high on the clock. As my bank account started to dwindle I was still compelled to spend what little I had on weed. I had to move back in with my parents at the age of 24. 

I got sick of myself and knew I had to make some drastic changes. I started to exercise daily and adamantly pursuit a career that I went to school for. I picked up photography along the way and it has opened up my world. I slowly cut down my marijuana consumption and finally achieved sobriety, 3 days strong and counting. I know it's going to be hard, but I am hopeful that I will quit for good, get a new job, move out, and travel more within the next year. 

Try to remember who you were before becoming a stoner. Be true and strive to be the best version of yourself.

Letter to myself. No more mediocrity,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hht4l9/letter_to_myself_no_more_mediocrity/,2020-06-29 08:17:02,"Why is quitting so hard and why do we keep failing at it? As sad as it is, I am currently asking my self this question, do I want to succeed more than I want to smoke? Not knowing the answer to this question is actually terrifying. When I think about my life, I have so many goals and dreams being only 26 years old I have so much ahead of me and there is so much I want to achieve in life, but every day I also want to get high af. It is always ""I will start tomorrow"" and slowly letting my life pass in front of me while everyone else is progressing. Even though I am not a complete fuck up my life ended up being just mediocre. I guess that's what happens when you don't really try hard at anything.

I have made a decision. I will not live a mediocre life anymore. No more getting high and eating shit food all day and never exercising. No more smoking a ton of cigarettes all day that you wake up spitting black tar every morning. 

Your whole life you are told that all you need is a college degree to have successful career but now you know its total BS. How the hell do you expect to land a decent job when weed took all your social skills from you? How are you going to walk into in interview confidently? You have been smoking so much to the point that you don't even know how to hold a conversation for more than 30 seconds.

I don't even like most of my friends to be completely honest. When it comes down to attracting the right people to your life you need to have something to offer in return. If you are always too high to have fun and be engaged no one will want to friend you. Friends aside, what kind of partner do you want to end up with? What quality of woman can some stoner dude who just lays around all day really attract? The women I have had in my life are no where near the quality of women you really want.

Not gonna lie, this has been very hard for me to write looking at my life in the most honest way which can be painful. We see the everyone else's flaws easily but facing yourself can be the hardest thing. 

Not really sure why I wrote this whole thing, I guess hoping that when I'm craving tomorrow morning I can read it and stay strong. To all the people I have let down I cannot apologize to you directly but I have to say it somewhere and I'm glad for anonymity of the internet. To my parents, I am sorry for not living up to my full potential. To my sister, I'm sorry for not being the big brother you needed during your hard times. To my ex-girlfriend, I'm sorry for all the pain i put you through I wish you all the happiness. To all my real friends, thank you for staying by my side during my darkest moments.

 First things first: marijuana is not the cause of your problems. The cause of your problems is THE SAME THING THAT CAUSED YOU TO BECOME ADDICTED TO IT.

I quit 6 months ago. It was difficult and came with months of wrestling with it. But, I will tell you why it was worth it for me. 

I always wanted to do Brazilian jiu jitsu. I did martial arts over 10 years ago and have always been an advocate for it's benefits. I wanted to get back into it but never was able to make it stick. I took the step a week ago and signed up. After my first class, I was excited about it and wanted to go back the next day. The next day was a rainy cold Wednesday. If I was still smoking weed, I would have easily convinced myself not go. But I had nothing else going on. I had absolutely nothing that sounded more fun than going to jiu jitsu class. If I was smoking weed, you bet your ass that getting high and gaming would have sounded like way more fun. The fact that I actually want to go back each day is all the proof I need to know it's working for me.

""I'll start tomorrow"" or next week... Or next month.. or next year. That's easy to say when you're stoned. 

Just stop. Let yourself be bored. Only by being bored will you really gravitate to what you should be doing. 

You are worth it. Give yourself an opportunity to take a step back and get to know yourself. Contemplate."

But here’s the catch.  Weed makes you fucking dumb.  You don’t feel your head pounding like a hang over does but you have mental fog, poor memory, and difficulty concentrating.  It is harder to learn.  To communicate.  To be present in the moment.  

It is really hard to realize the difference for us current and former stoners.  But when you go sober after smoking so much for so long you realize the hangover of weed is BAD.

And no joint is worth feeling totally dumb and useless the next day.

Feeling productive, present, and sober is better than any joint.  

If you’re craving a joint, just think of how you are going to feel, or want to feel tomorrow.  Is that hang over worth it?"

Do not smoke weed to ‘help’ your mental health,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/erldkz/do_not_smoke_weed_to_help_your_mental_health/,2020-01-21 02:02:26,"This is my personal experience with using weed to deal with problems or forget about shit.

So I’ve heavily cut down on weed, Lately I’ve only been smoking on the weekends which is good for me. I thought it’s fine no big deal.
I’ve started to notice the overthinking/irrational feelings again which now i realise, happened way too much when I was smoking heavily. I can really see how weed can affect relationships and work life etc. 

Also I’ve noticed that after a weekend of smoking, my work performance in the week starts of slow, then gets better as the thc gets out of my system. It really does have an effect on everything, especially if you’re a daily smoker.

It might just be ‘only weed’ but it still negatively impacts your mental health way more than you think it does. This is why I’m cutting it out completely. 

I urge you to just try 30 days without weed. Make the decision today that enough is enough and it’s time to cut weed out for good. Feel the difference in your mental health, your productivity, your relationships.
Tell me the withdrawal wasn’t worth it."

I've been smoking daily for over a decade and I just quit cold turkey today.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cw8pp0/ive_been_smoking_daily_for_over_a_decade_and_i/,2019-08-27 22:48:40,"I think I just finally hit my stopping point. I've been at rock bottom for probably the last 5 years at least. I originally started smoking only because it was fun, but at some point it became a crutch. I used marijuana to hide from my anxieties. I would get stoned every day and night and just tell myself, ""stop worrying about it"".

At this point I'm completely unable to get a good job that pays well or even offers insurance, so I'm effectively poor. I need change, I need a good life. I can't keep telling myself, ""one day it will be legal and you can get a good job then"". No, I'm gonna be 27 in 2 months and I can't wait any longer. I wish I lived in a world where I could get high and have a good life but sadly I just didn't land in that timeline. I have to accept that and finally move on.

This is a practice in self control and mindfulness. I have high hopes that I can do this. I plan on applying my addictive personality to the positive feeling of resisting the urge to smoke. If I can addict myself to not smoking then I may just be able to trick my brain into going through with this.

Thanks to anyone who had the time to read all of this. Wish me luck

Sincerely I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Here's hoping to continued sobriety for us all.

I've been smoking for ten years and I'd say the last five I smoked all day, everyday. I just got back from a trip to Costa Rica and I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to quit smoking. The first day at the farmer's market I had to opportunity to buy weed and I didn't! The second day a few people in my group went to smoke....and I didn't go with them! So that's two bicep curls of my ""No Muscle"" and it will get stronger every time I say no to smoking!! I'm back home and there's no weed at my place and my friends know that I'm going to not want to be around the smell or sight of it still for a while. If any of you reading this have a desire to quit just remember one thing.....that is a HUGE part of quitting. Now take that desire and put it into action! This is a life change.

In my late teens and 20's I have taken breaks intentionally and unintentionally for periods of time ranging from a few months to more than a year at a time.

In the past 2 - 3 years I built up an almost nightly drinking habit. I had not tried to fully quit at any point in that time, but did significantly reduce my alcohol use at some points. Alcohol never impacted my life or got in the way of my responsibilities. 

I hadn't smoked since September of 2018, i kind of just ran out at one point and didn't feel like using weed again. But I decided during quarantine to quit drinking and enioy smoking again for a bit. 

It has worked, I've had fun. And having quit drinking, I feel much better physically. However, weed is not compatible with my mental health issues in the long term, and it is again time to say goodbye to smoking. 

Old mental problems are coming back up and messing up the good, healthy groove I had going. It took about 2 months of daily smoking for me to get back to this poor mental space. It's definitely exacerbated by being in quarantine and my usual schedule being impacted severely. 

I know I'll be able to do it as I have before, but now I realize I also need to avoid alcohol as well permanently if I am not smoking weed. I can't do any more of the switching between weed and alcohol pattern. I didn't even realize I was doing it. 

Basically all mindset altering substances, even caffeine, are bad for my mind. I literally tell myself every time I'm all the way sober after a smoking or drinking phase, ""wow, I feel so much better. Wtf is wrong with me, why do I keep smoking/drinking"". 

I wonder if anyone else here has gone through this process in this manner as well? Using weed to quit drinking, and then quitting smoking. Or bouncing back and forth between the two substances over time.

""Quitting is going to change me and my life!"" 

**I couldn't have been more wrong.** 

Its always been my mindset/personality. Not the weed. I'm a lazy fuck because I'm a lazy fuck, not because I would smoke (it did make it worse though). I'm unmotivated because I'm unmotivated, not because I used to drown myself in weed. I'm depressed because I'm depressed, not because I was suppressing my emotions with weed. It's all me, its always been me and I'm just now coming to terms with that on day 45 (i think?). It's gotten better, with time and hard work (if you can call watching tv for 6 hours instead of 8 a day hard work). Slowly but surely, I'm going to get through this. One tiny step at a time, and I'm going to stick to my abstinence. Why? Simply because I already have low motivation/low energy/depression and I've chosen not to make it worse by dowsing my brain in marijuana every waking minute to suppress the noise of my inner thoughts telling me ""I need to do something productive, I need to do something that makes me happy!"" Weed made me feel ok with doing nothing and allowing my life to slowly decay right before my eyes.

To anyone feeling discouraged that things aren't magically getting better, they won't ever get better by sitting there and waiting for a massive change to come around, you have to take it into your own hands and push the change along. Quitting will help tons but what will help you so much more is focusing on your mental state. I wish you luck, strength, and courage to pursue what you're wanting to achieve, no matter how big or small.

Edit: Thanks for the silver! And thank you for all the positive replies, means a lot to hear encouragement and to know that other people are going through this as well."

Quitting weed will not solve all your problems; it's likely one step in a longer process.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7oyxqx/quitting_weed_will_not_solve_all_your_problems/,2018-01-08 17:45:40,"I've been posting a lot today, but as I've been reading through the site, I wanted to share one last thought:

A lot of people, like myself, used weed to cope. I struggled my whole life with anxiety and depression, and weed paradoxically both helped & made it worse. When I quit, those problems didn't magically go away. Instead, I was able to reacquaint myself with my own mind, free of outside influence. I saw a lot of issues there that I needed to deal with. So I made a series of other life choices.

What I did:
(1) Sought out a mental health counselor for weekly sessions
(2) Started taking medication (Seroquel) that helped me sleep 8 hours a night & stabilized my anxiety a bit
(3) Started going to the gym as frequently as I could (2-3x a week)
(4) Picked up new hobbies (I started playing IM volleyball at my school, started paying more attention to cooking & trying new recipes)

I feel much better now than I did at the worst point of my addiction. *But*, I think it's extremely important to point out that *quitting on its own was not enough to bring about these changes*. It was an absolutely critical decision that allowed me to pursue the types of things that helped me more and got rid of this illusion that I was solving these problems myself through self-medication.

I also want to echo the thoughts of another post I read today. This journey is rarely a linear trend toward feeling better and better. I can look back now and say I am in a much better place, but it was not a straight shot. I hope that those of you who are committed to this also commit yourselves to other ways of addressing the health of your body & mind. Please be kind to yourself, and practice self-care. I know that many of us don't have the resources to best help ourselves (I didn't have health insurance for the first 21 years of my life), but there are many other things you can do to help improve your life, and importantly, your mental health. I really hope you all continue to work toward that <3"
I fucking did it. I can't believe it. 1 year sober.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/6dafhc/i_fucking_did_it_i_cant_believe_it_1_year_sober/,2017-05-25 19:44:43,"I never thought I would be able to say I would be sober a year. Drugs have been such a huge part of my life. I used various drugs from 15-25, but weed has always been my main crutch. I remember feeling totally helpless and panicked when I would search the carpet and floors for weed crumbs; when I would run out and have a panic attack and desperately tried to think of a way I would get more; when I would get that rush of getting the baggie in my hands, running up the stairs and immediately packing a bong; when I blow through my paycheck just for weed; when I would fuck random guys just to get high.

Yeah, I was a full blown addict. I always will be. I still have my addictions (food, sex), so I still have a lot to work on. It is very frustrating to not be able to enjoy life's pleasures without it becoming an addiction. But it is not consuming me like drugs. I am aware, and I am functioning. This was by far my biggest addiction. 

Life has become so different and wonderful since quitting drugs. I am more social, more focused. I'm going back to school in the fall to study psychology. I am getting a raise and a new job title this summer. I am in love and living with someone who lifts me up. I have more friends. I don't have a temper anymore. I am no longer violent. I love myself. 

I know a lot of you are struggling taking that first step. I know life without weed seems absolutely terrifying; it was for me when I decided to quit. It has become your crutch and your best friend. Weed never judges you or makes you feel bad. It only makes you feel good and safe, like your wrapped in a warm blanket (pardon the cliche). 

But you have to ask yourself: Does the weed own you? Is life simply impossible to live without a pipe/bong/joint in your hand? Because if it is, you need to quit. 

The day I quit, I smoked the last of my weed and threw away all the paraphernalia. I could not have quit if there was any type of temptation in my house. I downloaded the app Habit Hub, which helps you keep track of how many days you've been sober. I did it without a support group, but that was just what worked for me. 

What I'm trying to say is, you can do it! I believe in you. I promise you life will get better. Each day sober has made sobriety so much easier. That first month will suck, but after that, you will feel like a brand new person. Don't let it own you; take control of your own life. You deserve it!

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this if you did. I am so proud of myself, and I find nothing wrong with saying that. 

Be proud of yourself too.

TLDR; I hit one year sober! Fuck yeah!"

When I am not high, I crave it and feel like it would make everything so much better, so much more exciting and surreal. When I am not high, I usually feel unmotivated without dangling weed in front of my face. That's why I give in almost every time, I convince myself that it's not the ""right time"" to quit smoking (whatever that means). 

Then, when I do end up smoking and riding out my high, I start to feel terrible about myself and come up with all these goals and aspirations in order to change myself. I write it out all down too,  ideas for things to major in, hobbies to pick up, classes to take, health routines. Then, I do none of it, fall asleep and wake up the next day wanting to get high again.

Then you are sober again and you want to recognize how it is different than being high. So you observe your mind.

The more you smoke, the more you continue to observe your mind which makes you aware of problems through which the weed is meant to fix or cover up.

I haven't smoked in 4 months after previously smoking every day for the last year \(and multiple times a day in the last 3 months of my use\)

I had been feeling pretty down this week for multiple days in a row, and somehow convinced myself that I could handle smoking again. So I bought a new piece and hit up my old dealer...

When I got the weed, I just looked at it and instantly felt sad. My life has improved dramatically since I stopped smoking\- I never have anxiety anymore, my sleep is great, no more mucus, I'm thinking clearly and doing some of my best work. And I knew that by smoking today, I would be putting all of that at risk.

So, I decided to flush the weed down my toilet and throw away my new pipe. 

All in all it was about $200 wasted. I see it as a low price to pay for the gamble I was about to make...and I think it took actually holding and seeing the weed to fully realize that.

I'm actually feeling pretty proud and happy\- and am gonna treat myself to dinner out tonight with my girlfriend. 

Just felt compelled to share that, keep the good fight going my friends!"
You're life isn't over because you're an adult and you wasted your youth smoking - it's only beginning.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fd416v/youre_life_isnt_over_because_youre_an_adult_and/,2020-03-04 02:55:14,"I just want to say for all the people on here who are 30+ or even in their twenties, please don't look at your past with regret and guilt as to what you could of done differently, the only person that matters right now is your present self, and looking at the past with negative emotions only hurts the person who is right here, in this moment. 

You can be fourty years of age and have the whole world ahead of you, meet a new partner, gain a new friend, go to the gym or start other physical activities, everyones lives begin somewhere, there's no specific age you need to be to begin feeling happy. 

But I promise you, looking back with sorrow, guilt and what ifs, doesn't help anyone, it just hurts you. Look towards the future and smile and the good times you had, and forget the rest.

If you’re just starting out, my best advice I’ve ever received and ever given is you need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable for a while. I know you want to crawl out of your skin to escape how you feel in this moment. But don’t, stay uncomfortable. You will adjust, I repeat, you will adjust. 

In the last 4 months, I’ve excelled at work. I’ve passed 2 classes in my college coursework. #3 will be done this month. I’ve faced some social anxiety in the face. It was hard but I made it through and didn’t die or smoke. So it was successful. 

The clear headed feeling is incredible. Once the fog lifts, all is clear again and it feels so good.

ENOUGH. Be honest with yourself.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/du99il/enough_be_honest_with_yourself/,2019-11-10 12:10:53,"I’m getting so fed up with myself. I don’t feel trustworthy.

I’ve been too cowardly so far to commit. “I’ll take a break after this cartridge runs out,” I tell myself. “I’ll stop for just a couple weeks, just to recharge.” Or, the deadliest one: “I have nothing to do tonight anyway, it’s not like I’m missing out on anything.”

These are weak things to say. I know I need to stop, I KNOW it, yet I give myself excuses every time. This means I’m being dishonest to myself at best or abusive to myself at worst.

I need to use firmer language. It’s not “taking a break”, it’s quitting. It’s not “getting back into it”, it’s relapsing. Nights where I choose to get stoned and play the same video games I’ve been playing since 2012 instead of call my family or read a book or get dinner with a friend are **wasted nights**. They’re zero-nights. They seal me off from the world around me and dump my precious, irrecoverable time down the drain.

I feel weak and ashamed when I go to bed high, and I feel strong and proud when I resist the temptation. Is that not enough incentive for me to quit?

Pain is a great thing because it tells us what we need to stop doing. Would I continue to hold my hand against a stovetop after I felt that it was hot? **NO.** So why do I continue to do things that make me feel weak?

I’m done hiding my shame and letting it poison my happiness. I’ll wear my shame like armor, use it like a map, let it point me toward decisions that make me feel strong and proud.

I am addicted to weed, and I am ashamed of it. Enough self-pity. Straighten up."
day 80 - quitting weed wasn't a magic bullet for my life getting better,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ad8up9/day_80_quitting_weed_wasnt_a_magic_bullet_for_my/,2019-01-06 22:29:42,"I'm at day 80 now and I was totally expecting my life to become much better and everything be a lot easier one I quit weed. It took a while for it to sink in that weed wasn't the source of my issues, so quitting wouldn't solve all them. 

&#x200B;

I've had anxiety and depression stemming from chronic trauma for a long time. It wasn't the typical ""beaten, raped, held hostage"" kind of trauma so it went undetected for a long time. 

&#x200B;

I was using weed in order to feel good without dealing with the source of the pain. quitting weed has made me face the pain head on and deal with its consequences, mostly grief but I've also had to work on problematic behaviors that became ingrained through years of the same pleasure seeking/avoiding of pain patterns. 

&#x200B;

So yeah my mental clarity is a bit better. There are not so many ups and downs. My memory is better. But overall everything is just a bit better than before. Quitting weed hasn't been the magic bullet that I thought it would be, it's only been the first step towards living the life I want to. "

Reasons getting high is not the answer I'm looking for,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/b12d89/reasons_getting_high_is_not_the_answer_im_looking/,2019-03-14 20:26:48,"Let's be honest, weed brought me some pleasure, some good stuff - there was not *only* bad - I would lie to myself or be overly harsh on myself if I would deny this. And self compassion is important.

When I find myself romanticizing and being nostalgic for the good parts of what weed can bring me it's important to also remind myself all the negative consequences this has and why weed doesn't work for me, so I'll try to make a list :

\- Whenever I've had a stash at home, I've not been able to moderate and use it reasonably. I have always binged on it excessively.

\- When I have a stash at home, getting high becomes the focal point of my existence. Everything else becomes a chore that I have to get through in order to create the moments where I can get high. Things like friendship, family, my future, become ''stuff to do'', ''stuff to get out of the way'' so I can get high.

\- I isolate and start living a double life which I hide from family and acquaintances.

\- I am not proud of smoking up all the time when I have a stash so this has an effect on my self esteem and self respect.

\- I become paranoid and very vulnerable when high. I cannot deal with the external world when high. A simple telephone call can freak me out. Or simply hearing people talk outside my door, in the corridor.

\- The creative aspect of getting high quite soon leaves place to a more dark and numbing type of high.

\- There are strong chances getting high (especially in unreasonable frequencies) will have a negative impact on my mood even after I stop smoking. Which is a risk that is perhaps not worth it.

\- Positive and healthy habits such as working out, jogging, meditation, journaling, eating well, sleeping good hours become very hard to do.

\- I become numb to what my heart really wants in this life : friendship and love. I delude myself into not caring anymore. But deep down I probably do and one day will regret it. This kind of thinking can occur even while I get high. Which makes me feel guilty and most of all sad.

\- Often, as soon as I get high - I feel regret about being high and tell myself I gotta get out of this. Once I get ''unhigh'' getting high again seems like fun and a good idea. The cycle goes on.

\- If I get high constantly I don' even really remember anymore what happened, what I did. Even if I had a good time watching ''X'' movie, my mind will forget about that.

\- It is not a sustainable strategy, even for dealing with anxiety, because the more I would smoke, the less it will work. After a while I will find myself just as anxious, only that I am also smoking all the time. Which is one more problem. The only way to deal with my anxiety is to practice dealing with it naturally.

There are probably more reasons but this is what I can think of right now.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

Edit : I am very happy and thankful if this list can be of service to anyone :) That's why I thought of writing it on here instead of a simple word doc I would have saved on my computer. So thanks back to anyone who thanked me for writing it :) Also, it feels so damn good to know people can relate and that we are not alone. Often when I go out there in the world I feel so different and isolated from other humans. But in truth we are not ... 

The worst part is that there might be a lot more reasons. I thought of these two later on today :

\- The simple health hazard it poses. Putting smoke in my lungs cannot be good. Why risk my physical health and put my body through this ? Especially if I cannot smoke in a responsible and very occasional way.

\- Pain, anxiety, sadness and life's challenges are, in a way, opportunities to grow. Namely by practicing natural ways to cope (meditation, presence, acceptance, and many more), by finding the strength *inside* ; I've experienced this at times when I dealt with things naturally and as a result I discovered I am not as weak as I thought. On the other hand, when I rely on weed (especially to the unreasonable extent I seem to only be capable of) to deal with pain, I am giving up this opportunity. I am delaying my chance to become a stronger me.

I guess the best reasons are the ones we truly believe.

What are some of your reasons ?"

Pick up that hobby you left behind, chase that dream in the back of your mind. Be bold, be honest with yourself and others. Learn to love who you are.

The person I am now compared to who I was 447 days ago is a night and day difference. I eat better, I work out regularly, I'm down about 25 pounds. I actually have a short term and long term memory now. I have dreams at night(admittedly this is not always a good thing lol) and I sleep better overall.

I have more energy and I look forward to what life has in store for me. You can say the same things, know that putting down the weed will bring you one step closer. I believe that you can do it."
A guide on quitting weed and leveling up in life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/4e5tw5/a_guide_on_quitting_weed_and_leveling_up_in_life/,2016-04-10 17:43:41,"I’ve been on this forum for almost a month and I think I can contribute to this community. This is my idea of a guide on how to quit weed, I hope it helps at least one person. I don’t want to offend anyone, this is just my thoughts on the matter and I am by no means trying to force my views, I am just sharing my ideas.  Here goes:

Like in everything in life, quitting weed has more than one point of view to it. You cannot just take up one philosophy and say “this is the correct way, all other ways are incorrect.”. Every philosophy has its advantages and disadvantages, so if you focus on just one, you will most likely make the mistake of ignoring the disadvantages and only focusing on the advantages until it’s too late and you find yourself relapsing and being too angry at yourself to want to try again.  There are different aspects through which you should view the idea of quitting weed (or any other addiction for that matter) – Psychological / Philosophical / Physical / Social / Visual. Each of these are connected with each other in a way, they are basically one big whole, but we will just look at this whole from different points of view. I will share my thoughts on each of these aspects in a moment.  These are not the only ones, I cannot think of any others right now, but if I do my job here correctly, you will be able to think of some other factors by yourself.

First of all I would like to accent on the fact that you should eliminate the idea of duality from your everyday life. The idea of duality is that when you think about something, you always create an “internal debate” with yourself about the thing you are thinking about, because you believe that there are at least two ways to view it. For example when you think about quitting weed, one part of you thinks “weed is bad, I must not use it again”, and immediately another part of you thinks “well it’s not all that bad, I mean there has to be at least 1% that is positive about weed because I’ve smoked so much, obviously there HAS to be something good about it”. This creates an internal struggle to pick one side and stick to it, because you want to think everything through and make sure that you have the right thinking about the subject matter and that you aren’t making a mistake about this. Now imagine how such and internal debate emerges every time you focus on some thought, it feels very overburdening, doesn’t it?  In order to remove the concept of duality you must acknowledge and accept the idea that everything is one. Smoking weed is just smoking weed, there is no need to label it as bad or good, it is one whole thing. If you focus on one part of it and label it as good or bad, then you create duality and hinder your progress. The things I write may be hard to understand intellectually and logically, but through practice, you will start to gain understanding of what I am sharing with you. This is something I picked up from Zen philosophy, if you would like to know more about this, I suggest you read the book “Zen mind. Beginners mind” by Shunryu Suzuki.

Psychological Aspect:
	When you want to quit weed, you have to make sure that you understand the idea of wanting to quit. If you really want to quit then you make that decision and live with it day by day. If you understand this then you will not be afraid of relapsing, because you do not want to smoke again even if you have the option to do so. When you say to yourself “ I do not want to smoke anymore” you are stating that it’s just something you do not want to do and that’s that. Even if somebody says “ Dude , let’s get high, come on bro, I got a big bud here etc.” it doesn’t matter because you have consciously made the decision that you do not want to smoke. Similarly if you have some internal “popup” to smoke it doesn’t matter because ultimately you do not want to smoke anymore. Do you understand what I’m saying here – You do not want to smoke anymore, why should you smoke again because of some small internal though that made you think about smoking, not about YOU WANTING TO SMOKE, just about smoking (there is a difference between the two things) ?  What does it matter that you think about smoking, when you do not want to smoke. Some people fail here because when they admit to themselves that they do not want to smoke, they are not fully devoted to that idea, they have not looked into every part of themselves and have not unified the idea of not wanting to smoke, it is exactly because of that that they easily relapse when someone offers them a joint. These people say “I will not smoke anymore, (except if a person offers me a bud/ if I find weed on the street/ if I get really stressed etc.) “. This is again the concept of duality – if you both want to stop smoking, and you do not want to stop smoking, how are you going to succeed at either one of these things?

 Philosophical Aspect:
	You have to realize that when you stop doing something that you have done for a long time, your life will change in more ways than one. When you stop smoking you might notice	that you no longer watch TV every night at 10PM or that you think about life differently now, that is perfectly normal, it is in change that we find enlightenment. Understand that life changes every single day and that you are paying more attention to it now, because up until recently your senses were numbed and you didn’t care about life in this way, you didn’t care about change enough to notice it. Accept everything that happens in your life, do not try to rationalize and understand every single detail of it, to accept it for how it is, is to understand it fully. You can always make your life better if you put your mind to it, there is no need to relapse just to cope with change.  With time and practice this philosophy gets easier.

Physical Aspect:
	When you stop taking a substance that you’ve been using for a while, your body is going to react in the beginning. This is called withdrawal and is also something that is going to pass. You might experience sweating, diarrhea, anger etc.  Know that this is a change your body is making and you have to bear through it. Every minute you “suffer” is bringing you closer to that wonderful moment when you no longer feel pain because you changed something in your life – in this case stopped smoking. There are ways to reduce the pressure of this transition – physical activity / green tea / cranberry juice / meditation and so on. Try some of them, if they don’t help, they won’t hinder your progress.

Social Aspect:
	When you decide you don’t want to smoke anymore, a change you are definitely going to notice is that the way you communicate with other people is going to change. You may think to yourself “I cannot have fun with this person now that I’m not smoking “or “I can’t get myself to be nice to someone because that person annoys me too much now that I don’t smoke”. The change in communication can also be something like “Hey this person is pleasant company now that I’m not high so much of the time”. It is important to understand that people are different, some will criticize something you do, others will support it, and others will be indifferent. Whether someone talks kindly or harshly about some idea you have or something you do, you do not have to react. You must accept the fact people are different and that that is just how they function. It is not necessary for their words to affect you if you yourself do not want to be affected.

Visual Aspect:
	A good way to help support your change in lifestyle is to make a change in your appearance. That way, when you look at yourself in the mirror, apart from the fact that you’ve decided to not smoke, you see a different, changed person. I’m talking about a new hairstyle / dressing style / less fat/ bigger muscles etc., something that changes the way you look so that it is easier for you to accept that you’ve changed and that you are constantly changing. 

So far I can think of this much and I hope this information helps you understand yourself and your life a bit more so that ultimately you can level up in life! If you found this guide helpful in any way, give it and “up” vote and post a comment so that more people can see it :) .

For now, if you have a level of THC in your system its an automatic 1 year ban from driving. The levels are ridiculous. I've heard of people being busted for Drug Driving upto 7 days after they have smoked. For us regular users, I'm perpetually over the limit.

Ridiculous that they give the same punishment for driving drunk vs driving a few days after a smoke!

Regardless, its another reason pushing me to quit. So day 1 is here, I've a busy long weekend planned to keep my mind off things.

This sub has been inspirational and helped motivate me into quitting once and for all, so thanks for that.

Watch this space.

Edit: I have a friend coming over tonight to take my stash and all other paraphernalia!

Edit2: So many kind words of encouragement, thanks guys. nice to know I'm not alone in this."
23 y/o spoiled kid who’s been smoking daily since 17.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i0cxig/23_yo_spoiled_kid_whos_been_smoking_daily_since_17/,2020-07-30 05:18:18,"I’m 23 almost 24 and I’ve been smoking since I was 17. I’ve had low self esteem since I was young but it really peaked about 4 yrs. ago when I started developing social anxiety and starting isolating myself inside my house. My grandparents have had a trust fund set up for me that I’ve been surviving off of ever since. I attended a local university but dropped out 2x in 2016 and in 2018 due to poor grades but I just started going back last fall and have been able to pull my grades up to still attend. In the meantime, my life has been in a constant downward spiral and since I stopped smoking yesterday I’ve came to the conclusion that I have fucked my life up. I’ve been bullied growing up and beat up which has caused me to develop social anxiety, nervous feelings about going outside, holding a job, being invited to functions in fear of humiliation. I don’t even know if weed was the contributing factor to all of this but I know for a fact that I was using as a coping mechanism. I hope to see a therapist or psychologist once I’ve detoxed and have had all THC flushed from my system. I don’t even know if this is the right sub to be posting this on but I hope some of you can give me a suggestion on where to start. Thank you!


EDIT: Thank you for all the support, constructive criticism and blessings you guys have sent my way. I didn’t expect my post to gain this much traction and attention without expecting the occasional negative criticisms from others but surprisingly everybody has been very supportive and I couldn’t ask for anything more. Thank you very much!"

I didn’t sleep well, which I was expecting...but I feel good this morning. Hopeful and a little proud. Anxious about going home tonight and doing it all over again.

I am currently on day 62.
And currently it's harder than ever.
The acute withdrawal is long gone, but since a week I'm thinking about smoking almost all day.
I'm currently trying to finish university, this is my last chance to get my masters. If I don't pass this one oral exam until the end of September I'm out. Problem is: this is a huge deal for me. I'm pretty fucking scared. And all I can think of is smoking.
I think this is a reminder for all of us: we have to tackle what caused our addiction. For me, I am addicted to the escapism I think. I guess the only way out is the way forward.
Thanks for reading, I needed to get this off my chest."
One year without Cannabis.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cihw80/one_year_without_cannabis/,2019-07-27 18:06:16,"Today is my one years old birthday. It's been one hell of a journey. I didn't think it was possible. After using for 20 years I felt like I was in a prison. I used to tell my friends to sneak a joint in my coffin, so I could spend eternity with my true love. I've done a complete 180, and learned so much about myself throughout this process. I will never chastise weed as I believe it has many benefits, and millions of people have the ability to enjoy it without having a problem. I know now that I am not one of those people. Instead of consuming Cannabis responsibly it consumes me. I still get cravings with ideas of how nice a smoke would be, and I don't think that will ever change. I'd like to thank this community for the inspiration provided during this time. I'm grateful for the support team I've surrounded myself with that allows me to express my concerns in times of need. None of this would be possible without my best friend who I consider a brother that I met on r/leaves. We live on completely different sides of America and have forged a life long bond. Most of all I'd like to thank me for putting in the hard ass work required to make this happen. I want to close this by letting anyone struggling know that you can put an out of control problem behind you. It sucks hard. It takes time and work. There are plenty of shitty days before the really good ones start. It's a physical and mental battle. It takes everything you have at first, but before you know it you'll turn that corner and begin enjoying life without a safety blanket. I wish all of my former stoner brethren continued success in your future endeavors, and those of you who are considering joining us, I extend the invitation to join the club. Go out and make today the best day possible, and then make tomorrow even better. Once again I'd like to thank everyone that is a part of this community, and I look forward to the continued inspiration I know you'll provide me. Year two here I come!"

Without weed I can talk again.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7tuuxd/without_weed_i_can_talk_again/,2018-01-29 22:33:38,"Growing up I was always very social and articulate. It wasnt till I started smoking that I became withdrawn from others. It's like the classic stoner voice (""heeeyyyy mannnn"") didn't fit with how I normally spoke and, because of this, I found that I would often slur my words/misspeak in day to day conversation. I became very self conscious of this fact and opted, in many instances, to just remain silent instead of engaging with others. To make matters worse I used weed as a way of dealing with my newfound antisocial behavior. 
Since having quit, I've regained my ability to speak quickly and precisely and I've never been happier. Being able to communicate with the outside world the way I want to is better than any high I've ever had. "
Weed have fucked my life up.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ez8xqo/weed_have_fucked_my_life_up/,2020-02-05 15:37:13,"Started as a flirt and slowly became the answer to everything. Every problem, every pain, every mental issue i fought with. It became my identity. 

First time i smoked i was 14. Was love at first toke. Some bad shit happened and just like that i was 21. Voices started to manifest in my head.  I then closed myself in a room and detoxed. Was a scary thing to hear a voice in my head that was not mine that commanded me to do things.

Started getting my shit together and got in education. Took a job and that caused a work related accident that squashed my spine.

Few years after i toked once to sleep and just like that i was addicted again.  

I realized i have socially isolated myself.  Been on a reality escape and nobody cared so i just kept on falling down.

I am 40 now. Have sat in constant pain and smoked weed. Day and night for 10+ years now. Blamed this and that. The sexual abuse from my sister and my mother. Found so many reasons and excuses. But none of them was good. 

This is no way of life.

Went on a date a few days ago for the first time in years and it went well. But my memory is fuzzy about it. Think my memory have taken damage.

I toked last night and that deep paranoia was back. I got to stop this shit. It's no joke anymore.

Weed in moderation is great. Weed 24/7 really fucked me up. Never thought that the chase for relief ended up causing more damage than the accident.

Going to cut down.

I cant take this way of numbness no longer.. 

The paranoia have not left me yet.  Have not waked and baked for the first time in years.  

We have one life and i wasted it being wasted.

Going to get clean now.  Time to get in touch with myself again.

Peace.

103 days,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i9k8fj/103_days/,2020-08-14 15:28:34,"Hey guys. i was a daily, chronic smoker from the age of 17-28, the only breaks i had was when i was on vacation, or when i couldnt get my hands on any weed. The latter did not happen often, lol. I tried to stop a couple times, but didnt last more than a month.  


For many years i wanted to stop, but as most of you know, it takes more than just talking about wanting to quit. Talking is easy, talk is cheap. Action is what defines us, i know its a cliche, but still.  
I knew for a long time that i eventually would stop. In my mind i knew it was a wrong path, when youre smoking every day. So may things youre missing out on. The decline of health, economy and many other aspects.  
Some people dont see the problem, they re fine by smoking everyday. They dont see it as a problem, or rather refuse to. Those people, im afraid, are them that will smoke for the rest of their lives. But not me, and not us in this community. Were alle here cause we know theres more to existence than the getting high. We are on this sub because we are able to reflect about ourselves, and this journey we call life. You got to consider that as a strength.  


So here i am. Its my birthday today. Im turning 29. I havent smoked weed for over 3 months, and its my first birthday in many many years, where im not gonna celebrate it by rolling a spliff.  
Its a strange feeling, but also a very pleasureable one.  
Those 3 months hasnt been easy. At the 2 month mark i woke one day with alot anxiety, that lasted for a week. I didn't feel well, and still dont know what it was about. I guess it was my mind and body trying to adapt to my new life, and trying to send me signals that would make me smoke again. But i didnt do it, i think i would've gotten even more severe anxiety by smoking. After all, anxiety when i was high was one of the reason i decided to quit. The high just wasnt the same, as in the beginning.  


Im a little proud of myself, take care all!"

"1 month of no smoking, and never looking back again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hl04hp/1_month_of_no_smoking_and_never_looking_back_again/,2020-07-04 12:39:40,"Wow what a different feeling this is... 
7 years smoking full time.. age 22. 

Once before i have gone one month weed free.. but this time is different. This time i’m much more clear on where i want to be in my future. 
It was a toxic relationship and it was not going to get me anywhere that i needed to be. A lot of times i would break down and cry whilst trying to quit for 8 weeks continuously, (yes, 8 weeks it took me, maybe even longer, to actually quit the habit) and ask “why me” “why do i have to be the one to do this when all my mates can continue” and i figured out the answer to those questions and i feel it is truly to become a beacon of light for my mates that want to quit but ‘cant’, and also to prove to myself something that i never thought was possible, and being able to start chase my dreams in full motion. 

I remember, whilst trying to quit in those 8 weeks, i threw my bong out in the bin 2 times, and went and retrieved it from a dirty bin both times, and even threw my weed in the fire at home, and the next day went and bought more. (Was a q) Instead of giving up i couldn’t accept that was my fate... you have to keep pushing and not give in. 

Since i have stopped smoking.. 
-Hardly any cravings anymore (i think this is due to enforcing that i’m not a stoner anymore, and moving onto a new personality and life) 
-Started reading again at least 30 mins per day 
-Meditate atleast once a day sometimes twice
-Have become more focussed in my business 
-Anxiety and depressive thoughts are slowly subduing  
-Eating vegetables nearly every night 
-No more eating junkfood everyday 
-Walk my dog everyday now and started to workout 3 times per week
-Still get major brain fog when doing sales calls or talking about in-depth topics trying to find ‘that word’ 
-My happiness and gratefulness to be alive has greatly improved. 
-Enjoying more of the simple things like different blue sky textures and the birds playing in the trees instead of being wacked on my couch. 
-Deeper connections with friends and family. 
I wont go any deeper on the list 😅

I think what helped with my mindset is instead of continuing to ask myself why me, i chose to see it as I’ve been chosen for a special task. Ive been given an opportunity to better my life dramatically, and i need to do this otherwise i will forever be the same.. 

If your considering make the change, dont kick yourself if it dosnt work out right away. Just keep pushing. I believe in everyone in this group and this group has helped so much with constant notifications to keep my mindset clear. 

My tips: 
1) Make your goals and visions 100% clear, enforce that being a stoner is not apart of your new life 
2) Do your hobbies in the first 2 weeks to distract you from smoking. 
3) Smash your bongs or pipes or put them in the bin THE NIGHT BEFORE BIN DAY!!! 
4) Read atomic habits by James Clear (audio book available) 
5) Make sure your friends know that you aren’t a stoner anymore, and take some time away from them if you need to. No harm in helping yourself! 

Much love... sorry for the long post. 
Truly hope this helps some people, at least 1 person and thats my goal for this post accomplished.. My next post will be at the 6 month mark.. keep kicking brothers and sisters ❤️❤️"
Does anyone else just replace THC with alcohol when trying to quit?,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g8tqob/does_anyone_else_just_replace_thc_with_alcohol/,2020-04-27 08:36:55,"I have been a every day smoker for the past 12 years. There was about a 6 month period about 5 years ago that I was 100% sober but I went back to the daily THC use. The last couple years every time I do try and quit I just end up drinking instead to replace it. I had to not smoke for about 2 months for a job and during that two months I got drunk every single night instead where normally I would get drunk maybe once a month. I also drink large amounts every night when I do this (like 12+ beers or almost a fifth of liquor).

Edit: I don’t know what I’m looking for with this post. I know I have a substance abuse problem and I need real help but I guess I just wanted to see if anyone is in the same boat. I feel like this whole scenario makes it even harder to quit. I start feeling terrible from drinking so much every day and It really starts taking a toll on my health quickly so I switch back to weed because at least it’s not as bad for me as my drinking. 

My journey last time was really hard and no where near how I wanted it but at least I quit for 6 months. Now even 6 months seems like an absolutely impossible task with a 1,000 more roadblocks in the way.

Edit2: Thank you to every single person that had responded! I have read every single response multiple times already and am taking them all to heart. I really truly do appreciate the kind words and encouragement more than any of you will ever know."

*The feeling that something won't be enjoyable without smoking first

*Burning your thumb or hair

*Telling the same stories and having the same conversations over and over

*Other people's spit on the pipe/joint/blunt

*Feeling dumb and passive because I've smoked too much

*No matter how much you smoke your problems are still right there when you come down and the problems might even be worse because you put them off

*Feeling like a failure but doing nothing about it


I'm so glad I'm quitting and I won't have to deal with any of this crap anymore.

The ”illusion” of creativity,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ic7ppi/the_illusion_of_creativity/,2020-08-18 23:21:48,"Just wanted to share some thoughs of mine. I understand that maybe everyone can’t relate.

I read a quote a long time ago that kinda stuck in my head. 

It goes something like this:

”With one hand, weed gives you interesting thoughs and creativity. With the other hand, it removes the ability to benefit of those things”.

Been thinking about it every now and then, and to me it completely makes sense.

I’ve gotten so many crazy thoughs and ideas through my years of smoking, but those thoughs barely evolved to anything else than just thoughs.

There are countless times where I have felt that it was gonna be much easier getting tasks done during the day if I was just a little bit high.

Mostly, I ended up not really doing those things. It made me lazy, unwilling to do things to my full potential.

Always felt somewhere that weed would help me in the process of drawing or playing/recording music. 

I think there is a honeymoon-phase in the beginning of the relationship with MJ, where these things are possible, and it makes you somehow productive.

But from what I have realized (a long time ago, before even wanting to quit), it actually works the opposite way. It distracts your mind to focus on the important things. I have just been standing still while life goes on without me.

I’m not saying this applies for everyone, but I am sure many can relate"

Just starting to see behind the curtain, though.  
And there, lie more beasts, calm and waiting.

I really don’t know if I want to fight them too, or let them be, as if they were not mine.

[Day 9]Who am I?,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ba466b/day_9who_am_i/,2019-04-06 17:13:31,"I cannot put into words how different my life feels after a little time away from marijuana. I had no expectations on this journey, the only thing I knew is that it had to be done. And now,  I don't even recognize my face in the mirror. 

Every morning, I notice something new about myself. My eyes don't look empty, they look bright, energetic, full of life. My skin is sooo much clearer, my voice less raspy. My hair is darker and shinier, much healthier than before. 

Who am I?

&#x200B;

Let me tell you who I am, I am u/Stay_Wavey and **I am becoming the hero of my life again.**

I feel like I own who I am, and what has helped the most give me this feeling of empowerment are the new habits I started since I stopped smoking pot. These are some of my new habits I have replaced my addiction with. I hope I can inspire one another person, the posts on here have kept me going through the hard times. It was an uphill battle with insomnia, cravings, and overall apathy, but you must embrace the process to overcome the storm. **The rainbow at the end is Goddamn beautiful.**

* I am getting up everyday at 4:45 AM and can (finally) fall asleep early (between 9 :30 and 10 pm).
* I am  spending most of my time in my studies aggressively pursuing my dreams. I want to, and one day will, become a machine learning engineer.
* I am in the gym most days. My body is getting stronger and I feel more confident in myself
* I meditate twice a day, the anxiety about my life is gone. 
   * I practice positive affirmations and remind myself all of the great things that make me me and how truly blessed I am to be where I am today. You cannot be stressed and worried when you are always grateful for the situation you are in
* My friends, some of whom I haven't spoken to in years, really missed me. I am making a commitment to call one friend I haven't spoken to in a while to say hello and catch up.
* I have a self-care routine for my skin, hair, and teeth. I am feeling better and better about myself. 
* I started Bullet Journaling and it has been an absolute game changer. Nothing feels unachievable, this is the most empowering feeling of my journey
* I spend more and more time by myself in nature and have started getting into photography. Nothing major... yet
* I blog and write about my journey into the tech industry
* I am building a website that can educate children on how simple and fun coding can be
* This isn't a habit, but that smoker's cough is gone. 

To overcome our addiction, we MUST invest more and more effort and energy into living a life that we no longer want  to escape from. It's not easy, and some days it is extremely exhausting. but it is so much more rewarding than smoking

But as proven time and time again, what you focus on is what grows. Focus on quitting (= not having something, lacking, depriving yourself) and it’s a struggle. Instead, focus on building the life you want for yourself. It's so much easier to put your focus on the things you *can* be doing instead of the things you're not allowing yourself to do.

-meditate on this being an opportunity rather than a chore 
-hold onto my thoughts rather than “blank” mid sentence 
-hold eye contact rather strongly rather than quickly look down....my eyes are open now, they’re open and clear and alive and bright rather than tired, red, baggy, dead
-speak with confidence and a steady voice rather than drift off and collect myself with “um” 
-hold my hands in front of me rather than fidget 
-handle the possibility of potentially messing up rather than drowning in defeat & catastrophic thoughts of failure

It hasn’t be easy to stop and stay sober this long, it’s a battle but my life is exceptionally more fulfilled sober.

My dad ripped bongs daily until he died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8jyr3k/my_dad_ripped_bongs_daily_until_he_died_of/,2018-05-17 01:36:45,"Hi all,
Throwaway because throwaway.

Since he was 16 my dad smoked weed. He was about 37 when I was born. The man I knew as my father was a shell of a person. He was an artist, and quite talented. He was kind and sometimes funny. But mostly he just sat on the couch watching shitty TV ripping bongs all day. His house was disgusting. He grew his own weed which enticed many of his gross ""friends"" to come over all the time. One of them broke into his house and robbed his corpse before calling 000 (911). 

He died when I was 20. I'm 25 now.
When he was alive he grossed me out so much that I ""knew"" I would never smoke weed. Alas, when my friend said she had some, I tried it in grief and with naive bravado in an effort to ""understand"" why my dad chose this substance over his kids. I wanted to ""prove"" that I could start and quit something that he never could.


Well, as you can imagine, that first experience felt pretty damn great. I tried it again once with fake weed and the high was so incredible, I was dancing with colours and music felt alive. 
This got me into DMT briefly, and magic mushrooms. 

But mostly, I smoked weed. Not every day. Rarely ripping bongs. But enough to be using it as an escape. Enough for it to seriously impact my mood, increasing my anxiety and allowing me to be satisfied with mediocrity, to ignore the fear and dread that has been welling up inside me since that first time with my friend.

I flushed it all down the toilet yesterday. I'm done. I will not let this tricky, conniving little plant own my life like it did my Dad's. 

I'm not saying it's the Devil's lettuce, or bad for everyone, but you need to recognise if you have a problem and get it out of your life once you do. 

Too easily I began accepting subpar standards of living and isolation.

No more.

1. Makes me very emotionally unstable on the comedown. A passive aggressive comment from a roommate will have me bawling.
2. Makes me feel guilty since I've been telling people I'm trying to quit and then doing it behind their backs.
3. Makes me less articulate. I even had to google for the word 'articulate'
4. Makes me sleep poorly.
5. Makes me impulsive.
6. Damages my lungs.
7. Inhibits my ability to study. I'm trying to study algorithms for job interviews and it really requires strong short term memory
8. Makes me feel like an addict. I go through periods where I can't stop thinking about how to get high.
9. Makes me compensate for depression and not get at the root issues.
10. Makes me feel like a hypocrite for judging my stoner roommate and then sneaking it in myself.

1 year free from Cannabinoids! Thank you Leaves community!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e798hu/1_year_free_from_cannabinoids_thank_you_leaves/,2019-12-07 06:33:14,"I’m a couple days late from the actual one year mark but I’ve really been looking forward to the day that I get to this milestone. As a former grower in a medical cannabis dispensary and a hash maker/processor/personal grower in my own personal time; I never thought I would live to see this day.  From a half oz of flower (or more) plus several grams of concentrates and lots of mg of edibles ingested daily I thought I was stuck in a loop, a cycle I could never break, but I know I’m not the only one because this sub reddit showed me that regardless of what your situation and background are it’s possible to be in control of who you want to be. Every day that I felt like smoking and everytime my friends were smoking around me I would scroll through the words of inspiration and wisdom from all of you guys. Whether it was someone that was going through their first day or someone reaching their first year it all reminded me of why I wanted to stop in the first place and where I wanted to be in my future. Without cannabis I wouldn’t be who I am today and I’m somewhat thankful for what it provided me when I truly needed it but a fine line was crossed and I never stepped back from that line and I felt the need to quit. Dependency is a risk that all of us have taken by habitually ingesting cannabis, but breaking the dependency is something that is more than achieve-able. Thank you r/leaves for being there for me when nobody in my life understood. From the early anxiety, sweating, irritability, having dreams for the first time in 9 years, nightmares, and panic attacks to the urges to relapse and start all over or even just having someone to talk to and let them know that it really does get better. Even though it wasn’t easy, I wouldn’t have been able to get through this as easily without you guys
Thank you r/leaves
I’m forever grateful

Being sober for a bit now I find myself able to interact positively with different people at work, school, and especially in my family that before I would find so anxiety inducing or hard to be around. 

I was often resentful of them, such that I would be easily irritated by things they say or do. It's such a good feeling the way it is now. It's not that I suddenly love everything about them, but simply that I recognize that I'm happier just accepting them for who they are instead of avoiding them or wishing they would change. Especially regarding family, acceptance is REALLY important.

If you are like me and have had a traumatic childhood, such that your family is a reminder of it, I believe that smoking that trauma away is what causes me to be resentful. 

Thought maybe some people might relate to this."
2 Years Since My Last Smoke!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hey52g/2_years_since_my_last_smoke/,2020-06-24 13:40:30,"The past year was such a whirlwind - marked by the painful loss of my incredible father, a move to another continent (to be with my family),  and a full career change. I was actually shocked to realize it's been 2 whole ass years since the last time I rolled one. I don't know if sharing this will help anyone and I'm sorry it's long! but I hope so, because I know how hard it is to get beyond that ""one more day"".

I'm turning 31 next month. I spent most of my 20s stoned out of my mind. I was an externally ""functional"" and stealth stoner - no one (even my closest friends) realized that I was high literally all the time, including at work - or they just assumed it was nothing serious. As someone with years of practice hiding my mental health issues as well, I was caught in a trap of disassociation, numbed out suicidal depression, executive dysfunction and suppressed anxiety - but all behind a guise of someone who had it together with a big smile. I tried quitting so many times - never lasted a day (""one more won't hurt...""). Eventually, things fell apart, piece by piece, but I kept smoking. It took a huge paranoid meltdown at a Kendrick Lamar concert (yeah.. :(...ruined that birthday gift from my partner) to realize that something had to change.

I did the opposite of ""one more smoke"" - I did ""one more day without smoking..let's just see if i can do that, then I can smoke"". I signed up for therapy (which used up the money i would have used for weed). I told my friends so they could hold me accountable (I staged my own intervention, basically), and I would stay with them when I was struggling. My partner, who wasn't hooked but smoked with me, stopped in support. I threw myself into an obsessive art project that took up all my mental energy. I don't know why it worked, but it did. Once my dad got sick though, there was no choice - I could not be stoned if I was going to show up for my family. It didn't help that I felt guilty as fuck for being so absent over the years. Let me tell you - if there's one reason to quit, it's so you can show up for your loved ones before it's too late.

Listen - quitting was hell. The revelation and the sunshine, honey, did not come right away. I got up close and personal with my darkest demons, and started to realize how many mistakes and fucked up choices I had done in my haze over the years. I slowly realized (and am still realizing) just how bad my mental health issues are. I realized how many friends I lost because I was too stoned to show up or reply. I'm not blaming the weed, because 100% I made my choices, and my depression and anxiety played a huge part - but the weed blurs everything. I used it as a constant escape, an act of fear every single time.

It's been fucking hard guys. But so, so, so worth it. I'm finally facing up to the years of unaccountability. I'm finally showing up for my family. I'm finally showing up for MYSELF, and taking steps to deal with my mental health. I actually am experiencing life again. I have a great job with an amazing company, that I'm trying really hard not to fuck up with my depression. But despite this being one of the hardest years of my life, for the first time in a while, I am proud of myself. 2 years baby. Fuck yes!

Please know it is possible and worth it. And no, it's not easy, but you'd be surprised at what the human spirit can withstand. Even if you fail, that is not a determinant of destiny - it just means you tried, which is fucking badass. (I still need to tell myself this - it's a process!)"

I become a stereotypical lazy and apathetic stoner when I smoke, and it turns out that girls aren't really into people who don't give a fuck about anything. 


I went on a first date for the first time since quitting a month ago and it was amazing. I was present for the entire conversation, I was witty, I could show my sense of humor and carry on whatever we were talking about. We talked at a bar for 3 hours and by the time I got home she already sent a text asking when we were going out again. 


If I was stoned this simply would not have happened. I know this because I've gone on plenty of dates stoned or as a heavy user. I know the nervousness it would make me feel, wondering what the hell should I say, what will she think, ect.

I've been dating this one stoner girl for two weeks now, and while it doesn't tempt me to smoke when I'm around her, man have I realized exactly what I was when I was high every day. We've hung out three times and she was sober each time--great conversation, etc and honestly it just feels natural. Yesterday was our 4th time meeting up and she had just smoked, she is a _zombie_ after smoking both physically and mentally. Her face had this expression that the ""lights were off"" upstairs, and her conversation skills slowed down to the point where she couldn't contribute in a meaningful way to the conversation. A lot of head nodding and 'yeah', 'ok', 'got it', etc. Mainly the look on her face was the most disturbing, here am physically talking to someone but upstairs, mentally...no one's home.

I saw herself in me before I quit. This is who I was, a zombie. And just like her, when not high we're two very interesting people able to hold conversations and truly experience life when we're social. It made me incredibly sad after I left yesterday thinking (1) I would've never had this realization if I was still smoking and neither will she and (2) how much of my life I wasted 10+ years being a zombie. It's frustrating knowing I will never get that time back.

I'm certain I'll have to break it off with her, it hurts to grow close to someone and at the same time watch them devolve. I'm also not into chastizing others into quitting or changing their life for the better, I'm a firm believer that you have to come into that realization on your own. It just sucks because I keep thinking about 'what if' and the lost potential :("

A note on withdrawal symptoms (TLDR: 4 weeks and you are physically back to normal),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/brt3mr/a_note_on_withdrawal_symptoms_tldr_4_weeks_and/,2019-05-22 23:34:09,"I don't know if I should post this or if it is to trivial, but here it goes.

I struggled with withdrawal syndroms for about two weeks after quitting. Anxiety, depression, extreme irritability (I would strain not to lash out at my girlfriend sometimes), thankfully not alot of sleep issues, but still quite bad. Especially the depression part made me want to start smoking again, to ""make it all stop"".

What helped me was a paper I found when I googled for ""Cannabis Withdrawal Syndroms"" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414724/). It states that the cannabinoid receptors that are activated by THC and other cannabinoids in weed will desensitize during periods of regular use (they talk about more than 3 times a week for a period of 6 months or more) and this causes any physical and some psychological withdrawal symptoms.

When you stop smoking, they will start to normalize again and this process takes about 4 weeks, with symptoms declining (on average) after 2 weeks. So anytime I found myself lying in bed and feeling like absolute dogshit, I would tell myself ""give it at least four weeks and if you don't feel better then, fuck everything and smoke again"".

Now here I am at day 17 and I feel great. My mind is much clearer, depression has mostly lifted again and the irritability is gone completely. So I'm glad I stuck with it and maybe some of you can take some solace when it gets hard during the first days or weeks. It will definitely get better and there's even scientific evidence for it!

EDIT: This gained more attention than I expected, so I just wanted to add something: Don't feel like something is wrong with you if depression, anxiety or anything else that you experience after quitting lasts more than four weeks. This was only about physical differences in the body, psychologically there is alot more going on and everyone is different! Quitting is the first step to self improvement and the things that it numbed might come back full force. But now you are able to take control over these things instead of repressing them, so be brave and stay strong!"

I'm 22, The first time I smoked was 17 but not regularly until I was about 19 or 20.

Maybe it's just that the craving is sufficed when I'm high, I don't know. What I do know is that it's making stopping pretty difficult. I'm easing away gradually, cold turkey is not an option for me.

When I'm sober; I am extremely anxious, self-loathing, irritated, and very unproductive. I feel like i'm in a constant state of panic basically. Smoking usually eliminates some of the said feelings, which always lead to me ending up caving in.

Some of the feelings when I'm high are, lost or disoriented. When I'm high I can say no to another joint or that extra toke, I can consciously say to myself ""This is enough I am done with this shit."" That's a broken record to me though, I can't even think of all the times I told myself I would stop.

If I had smoked last night...,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ibl9jh/if_i_had_smoked_last_night/,2020-08-17 23:41:35,"Hey leaves,

Last night, I got home a little drunk. I'm 4 days in to quitting. It was so nice out, the sun was setting, and I was craving **hard**. I was picturing the usual dusk smoke sesh on my porch. I was fighting not to text my dealer to come by with 3.5. If I had given in and smoked last night, here's what would have happened: 

* I would have waited an hour for my dealer to come by, missing the sunset altogether and been annoyed as shit by the mosquitoes while rolling/smoking
* I would have settled in to the couch and watched the same dumb tv show for the hundredth time while feeling super anxious, until I got too exhausted and went to sleep around 1am.
* I would have woken up at 11 feeling like shit, stayed in bed on my computer until 1pm, rolled up and smoked again
* I would have neglected to do anything that I need to do on my days off and become more anxious
* I would have ordered shitty, unhealthy food for brunchdinner
* I would have ignored my brother and sister asking if we could get together for dinner tonight
* I would have smoked again and repeated all the above

**Instead**, I finally pushed through. I usually don't make it past that kind of craving. Here's what happened instead:

* I enjoyed my waning tipsiness with delicious reheated pizza and a beautiful sunset on my porch. Pizza over dope any day. The cravings were gone by the time the mosquitoes came out.
* I watched a couple of episodes of a new, engaging show
* I ran a bath for the first time in forever and read my book

Celebrating one year today. This is the last time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eoq1o6/celebrating_one_year_today_this_is_the_last_time/,2020-01-14 22:28:27,"On this day last year, I (30F) quit marijuana for the final time.

11 years ago my brother passed away suddenly. I was 19 years old at the time, having just started my sophomore year of college. I quickly went from being the bubbly cheerleader type to being a complete stoner as I self medicated. I had no idea how to deal with grief and trauma. None of my friends had gone through anything like this, so I felt extremely alone. It didn’t help that my school had a huge weed culture, and I almost failed out of school several times. 

When I quit for the first time back then, I had to deal with all the suppressed emotions which came flooding back.  I got professional help from a therapist, who helped me to accept my grief and guilt. I graduated with a horrible GPA but made it through nonetheless.

After about four years of being cannabis-free I thought it would be okay to smoke socially. At first it seemed to totally fine and it felt under control. When it became legal in my state, things got worse and I got hooked on weed candies during a bout of depression. I was still functioning well so I continued to justify it, but my anxiety and depression eventually got out of control as a result. 

Today it’s been a year since I’ve used marijuana and I did it with he help of a therapist again. I am happier and more creative. I just want to acknowledge that this is a lifelong affliction, and that you’re never safe just because you’ve stopped smoking for an extended amount of time. I wouldn’t have been able to quit again if it hadn’t been for this sub! Thank you! 

TLDR: Started chronically smoking during a period of grief and successfully quit. Thought it would be okay to start smoking socially again but it slowly spiraled out of control. Hoping to warn others."

A comprehensive history of how pot helped to f*ck my late teens/early twenties (and how I want to make it different from now on),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g5jdsq/a_comprehensive_history_of_how_pot_helped_to_fck/,2020-04-21 21:19:57,"EDIT: Thank you all so much for the replies. I really didn't expect this reception. This sub is absolutely great, and I wish all of us much strength to get rid of the mental haze. 

My first experiences with weed were great. It was a novelty, made me feel different, expanded my thoughts - I've always been inclined to philosophy and things like that. Made me feel my mind was booming. This kind of feeling persists sometimes when I smoke today. But I believe this is all a big illusion. You don't need pot to be creative, to have the ideas you have. You just have to sit with it and dedicate yourself, when you're writing for instance.

When I got into university I was very young at 17 years old. That was the second half of 2013. I smoked pot kinda often, but it really wasn't such a big deal on my life. But when word came to the uni veterans that I was a 'pothead', it instantly became an association people made with me. I remember my early semesters, I would be 100% sober at campus and people would ask me if I was high, and making jokes (not like bullying... friendly jokes) about me being high and looking high (I'm a quiet albeit sociable nerdy-hippie-dreamy type). It got to the point that it started to bother me. Can't people just look at me and see beyond that silly pothead persona that was imposed upon me? I'm much more than that, y'know.

Let me continue - I started to hang out with the potheads at uni. I'll be honest - I made good friends at the pot circles, in the hidden places at the campus. I really liked these inicial times. But the best part of it only lasted a semester or two. I was young, didn't care about much, it was a discovery time, 'let's see how it feels to watch that movie/play that game/ listen to that album while high' etc etc. Over some time I developed a daily habit of pot.

In the first semester of 2014 I got a really interesting opportunity for an internship in some hipster enterprise that was starting, regarding music and branding (I've always loved music, playing music etc). They didn't have an office so I was supposed to work from home. It was really hypey and I had been chosen among many candidates, even people older and more experienced than me.

After I got the job and my first assignments, can you guess what happened? That's right, I would just stay high at home, play videogames and whenever I was supposed to do my job I would just lay down in bed and feel like shit. I was young, I was silly, my dad is an asshole that besides having abandoned me and my mother at a really young age, beat me up really bad when I was 14, mom's got no idea of discipline even for herself, and my grandpa (who was always a father to me) had recently passed away, so I had no one to help me, to say that I was supposed to work instead of playing, smoking and being a little shit all day. No one to say that I should have grabbed that opportunity and kept going. I basically just had a shitty performance at the first month and I left the job. The hipster-entrepeneur guy who was the boss was really sarcastic with me, and to this day I feel angry and sad everytime I hear about their agency or think about that time. Angry at him for being an asshole, but mostly at me for being such an irresponsible kid. 

After that, things didn't really get any better. After grandpa died (which was a bit before all this job thing) - exactly the day after he died, I started a relationship with a girl my friend had introduced me to in a house party. It was like fate, just after losing someone so special to me, she came into my life. To this day she's really important to me even though we're not together anymore. I'll call her G.

G was a great girlfriend, really understanding and caring. But there was a problem - she was a really heavy drinker and cigarette smoker. As an anxious and sad young man I eventually became just like the fiend she was. We'd go to clubs every weekend, many times we'd do it in the middle of the week, get fucked up on alcohol and pot. Soon she also introduced me to cocaine. I spent most of the time with G, in her house, smoking a lot, drinking, ordering chinese food, watching things and making love. Then we'd find a party to go, and meet her best friend who was the worst cocaine fiend of us 3, and one of the saddest creatures I've ever got to know. Then the three of us would get really high and drunk and etc. 4 to 5 times a week. We were doing coke once every two weeks, sometimes every week.

Me and G, we were both lost souls, unsatisfied with our subjects at university. She was a cinema student, I was in advertising and absolutely hated it. But I didn't really care I hated it. When I wasn't blinded in love with G in her house, I'd be at my family's home, smoking pot and playing Counter-strike with my buddies talking on Skype. Uni was easy enough - I've always been a reader, and theory and research were always natural to me, so I excelled in difficult subjects, while on the practical side of things I was gradually being left behind. You see, all my colleagues in advertising were starting to choose their paths. Some went to marketing, some to video, some went to graphic design. I just lurked around, smoked joints and cigs and met with my friends. Absolutely disconnected from the actual reason to be there. I hated all that fakeness and superficiality that governs the world of advertising, plastic people, plastic lives... But I felt like I didn't have anywhere to go. I didn't WANT nothing. Didn't want to BE anything. My depression was hitting really hard at that time. I had absolutely no idea of a future. Around this time I had a course on music production, which showed me a new path. But I had absolutely no discipline to compose at home or actually study the subject like it deserves to.

That was basically how my life functioned from 2014 to around the first half of 2017. I eventually broke up with G. I left cocaine, but I was still drinking and smoking both pot and cigarettes. I still felt the same way. At lost, with no perspective of a future or a career. It was the beginning of a really depressing phase of my life. Where I tried to get shit back together but just couldn't. I felt so lonely I ended up in a relationship with a girl who had many personal problems, but she wasn't understanding  like G. We'd be locked up entire weekends inside a tiny apartment, having really loud and absolutely pointless arguments. She even spat on my face. But I couldn't let go of her. My self esteem and mental sanity where absolutely rock bottom. I soon lost some friends because she didn't like them. I spent a year dating this girl and working part-time in a shitty public sector thing where I'd just play Age of Empires 2 all morning. At least it was inside the arts campus and I liked to hang out there. Again, my company was the pot and the booze and the cigs.

After breaking up with this girl in the end of 2017, I started cycling a lot. It helped fight the anxiety and trauma. Sometimes I'd cycle really fast and yell swear words. Then I started to go to the bohemian district of town every night. I decided to not try to muffle my problems with relationships and 'love'. I got out of the last one too traumatized. I had my bike and my independence, after all. 2018 and 2019 I spent going to cheap pubs, made a lot of ""friends"" on the street, became kinda known in the street which is really funny. But yeah, all of it cycled around getting high and drunk. I fell into cocaine again, then back out. Got a job with brand design in a renewable energy place. Absolutely hated those burgeois shits. Got kicked out because I just didn't fit. Then I started doing freelance graphic design for some friend's clients. The income is pretty low and I constantly feel I'm being exploited. I'm paying the price of ignoring myself. I'm stuck to this fucking advertising industry. 

Around the second half of 2019 I started to change my mind. I decided to quit drinking when I went out at night. And it started to work. Going out became a thing about cycling and meeting my friends, and not getting drunk. At the end of the year I vowed to live for myself and not ignore myself anymore. Then covid-19 came. As horrible a situation as it is, it's been an opportunity for me. I'm proud to say I've been 20 days without nicotine and never want to go back to it, haven't got drunk in months and I am now dedicating myself fully to music and music production. I'm back in meditation as well, doing it almost everyday and having insights about myself. 

But I still. Smoke. Weed. That goddamn weed. I know I have to stop. Weed's been there sabotaging me and helping me sabotage myself for 7 years now. I want to remember what life is like without it. I need to... That's why I decided yesterday was to be the last day I smoked weed. 4/20/20. I'll be strong. And I'll change my life. Thank you for reading."

&#x200B;

 

Keep on setting the intention in yourself to quit and continually remind yourself that its actually a wonderful thing to stop. You might feel mad because you feel like you're missing out, or in some way you're still attached to weed. Find out where that attachment lies, and what it is. For me I was attached to the feelings i would get from listening to music while high and that kept on sucking me back in. In the past I would be upset because i felt like i was missing out on the great feelings.. But reframe your perspective and it will be easier.

The fact is you're here because some part of you feels like your life would be better without it. For me I had to seriously remind myself of all of the great opportunities and doorways that would open for me with sobriety. I thought of all of the things Ive been missing out on from being high all the time. When you flip it on its head like that (rather than feeling like youre missing out on getting high) and seriously find a reason to rejoice in sobriety, you are dissolving the attachment to weed.

For me now when theres an urge or a thought comes up like ""oh i could get high right now"" i force myself to think ""no, weed does nothing for me anymore. i have used every ounce of benefit from weed, it has served its purpose. I no longer have anything to gain from weed, but i have EVERYTHING to gain from sobriety.I will gain clearer thought processes, easier time socializing, easier time planning and following through with what i TRULY want in my life, i will gain self-respect and a sense of accomplishment for finally doing what i know i must do.""

And by the time i remind myself of the fact that this is LITERALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS I CAN BE DOING FOR ME, the urge is gone. Because i evoke the legitimate emotion of rejoicing. And, friend, Im sure you have used up weeds benefit long ago. You're here after all.

This process of rejoicing is much easier than gritting your teeth and forcing yourself to stop when in the back of your mind you think you're still missing out on something. Write yourself a list of all the things you gain from getting high and be honest. Really see if theres something you think you still gain from it. Then write a list of all the things you will gain from sobriety.

I am only 9 days in this time around, but it has been the most easy and even enjoyable process for me because I have solidified it in myself to look forward to a wonderful, beautiful future for myself. For the record, it took many many many attempts to quit for me. Which is why I say continue to set the intention to quit and even if you slip, set the intention again. It will click for you, I promise.

And as a side note, since my attachment to music while high was a big one for me, I was pleasantly surprised to see my emotional response to music skyrocketed, rather than being half-there stoned out of my mind trying to recreate the same feelings of when I first listened to music while stoned. If the attachment to some pleasure of media (ie: tv, video games, music) is still there consider the fact that, assuming youve been getting high for years, it will actually be more pleasurable when you're sober. Because thats the great news, it will be. You will be refreshed and satisfied to see you will enjoy everything you enjoyed while high to an even higher degree. Because you will be truly present with the media you like.

Best of luck, much love, and dont beat yourself up for failing. You WILL get this. You WILL get the life you deserve, free of the insidious plant that has held you down for so long."

I'm a 25 yr old cone-head from NZ. Been smoking spliffs every day since I was 16.

I've been thinking about my weed addiction for the last few years and finally mustered the courage to write about it. I thought it could be cool to share it here and see who share's my experience.

It's in a kind of corny poem/song format but the rhythm of it helped me get it out, as opposed to writing it out like a diary entry or something.

Cheers!

I wake up, smoke weed again.  
Say hello to my old friend.  
Same thing I do every day.  
Yet those feelings don't go away.

  
Medicate what I don't understand.  
So I don't have to comprehend.  
What it takes for me to be a man.  
I say I can't but I know I can.

  
Don't know why I approach life this way.  
Change now and my problems go away.  
But something's holding me in place.  
I think it's the weed that I embrace.
  

I sit back, smoke weed again.  
I'm getting tired of this old friend.  
Always makes me waste the day.  
As long as we're together it's ok.

  
Always with me, it's comforting.  
Always stopping me from confronting  
My emotions so I chase the bliss.  
This is a feeling that I want to miss.

  
I look back at myself judgingly.  
Asking why I don't stop, half-jokingly.  
I know each day I smoke it holds me back.  
But I'm not racing, why chase a stack.

  
I lie down, smoke weed again.  
I'm pissed off at my old friend.  
Makes me awkward around my family.  
Forget talking to someone new to me.

  
I'd rather hang by myself, there's nothing cooler.  
I tell myself that, but who'm I trying to fool here.  
I stare at the computer, it's glare calming me.  
I don't feel alone, 'cause I've been smokin' trees.


If I get my shit together, I can free myself.  
But I'm scared of asking my people for help.  
If I do it on my own that could be respectable.  
But that will take some work, I'm a dope smoke receptacle.
  

I close my eyes and smoke weed again.  
I can't even look at my old friend.  
I blame him but I should be blaming me.  
For the shit I let it do to me.

  
All my fault but I can't live with that.  
So I light another spliff and play diplomat.  
Just smoke until the end of this last bag.  
By the time I get there, I forget the nag.

  
I'm off to score again, I know it looks bad.  
God, I hope I don't see my dad.  
If he knew, I don't know what that would do to me.  
But that's the same selfish thinking that's killing me.
  

I wake up, smoke weed again.  
Say hello to my old friend.  
Same thing I do every day.  
Yet those feelings don't go away."

7+ Days Sober and holy shit,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bix6i6/7_days_sober_and_holy_shit/,2019-04-30 04:57:54,"I missed being present. Being emotionally available for people who need me at any time. Not having to ignore a call because I'm too fried. Human connection. Also. I was an avid muncher...Lost 7 pounds since last week due to consistency in the gym, healthy eating, and I literally have barely felt like snacking. Cooking for myself is a fun process, not a drag. I feel high on life just by looking around at our beautiful earth and being present minded enough to realize how lucky we are to be able to experience life and how much I was keeping myself in the dark. I feel like myself again and I never want to be out of control of my actions(too high to do fucking anything). Even when I started a week ago, I did not consider this ""recovery"" because that would mean I was an ""addict"" and who would want to be classified as that? 7 days later, and I seriously feel like baking myself a fucking ""7 days sober"" cake because I am not worried about when the next time I am going to smoke is. It took me a few days without it to realize how much this drug controlled me and my whole day/life.

I am trying to spread so much positivity into the world and with how productive I have been in just one week, it really makes me sad that I wasted these last few years stoned instead of building myself up and living at my fullest potential. Ohh the things I could have done! Ohh the things I know I am still capable of, though! I feel so on top of the world right now and I just wanted to share it with you all. Life is seriously amazing, guys. Let's stop trying to escape it! 

(My mom passed away less than a year ago and she was the most important person in my life. I know things come up in life and you think smoking might temporarily help, but it will be much worse to face your true heart down the road, instead of taking care of them now. It feels so much better to feel pain, than to not feel anything at all. Life is seriously what you make it.. My mom would be so proud of me right now.)"

I'm 19 but started smoking when I was 13. Smoked daily multiple times a day from 14-18 and have now been sober from weed and darts since Feb 2017. Quitting smoking alone isn't going to transform your life but it might transform your outlook on it. 

When I was a daily smoker I was doing so partly because it felt like being high was my normal state, but also to help with my depression and anxiety. I'd wake up, rip a bowl. Spare period in school, run outside rip a bowl (I'd bring a bong to school alot). Lunch, rip a bowl. After school, bowls. The worst part is that a lot of my friends were the same as me and our sessions weren't even fun anymore. Initially we all had so much fun and would laugh until we cried and then went out to get snacks but it just wasnt like that anymore. We just did it to feel normal again. I can't speak for my friends but it felt like I was a walking zombie, always tired with no motivation to do anything without caffeine. 

A ton of people recommend smoking to cope with depression which I can understand if you're using it as social lubricant in the right settings, but after smoking weed for so long my relationship with weed and the way I felt while high was super unhealthy. I had this thing where I felt like I needed to smoke before anything (food, sex, movie, etc) so I can maximize pleasure and I became obsessed with ""not wasting"" any moments. Smoking weed in busy social settings started to make me stay in my head and make me paranoid, whereas it used to make me sociable and fun to be around. I knew I wouldn't have a good time going out if I smoked, and I knew I couldn't resist smoking so I just stopped going out with friends. Soon after my depression, eating disorder and anxiety escalated to a point where I was unable to leave the house. I dropped out of school. Girlfriend and I broke up. Stopped seeing my friends. Kept smoking weed. I gave up on my life. 

Two suicide attempts later I decided to change. I can't remember what sparked me wanting to change, but I know it came in the middle of the night and that I grabbed that little spark of motivation and held onto it for dear life. I threw out the rest of my stash (an h/o mind you) and decided to just try being sober for a while. I had no idea this sub existed, and no one I knew would ever stop smoking so I did it alone. I took baby steps to fixing my life. I said first weed goes, and the next week I stopped smoking cigarettes. The first 2 weeks were crazy difficult. Every time a pang of depression hit I wanted to run to my bong and hit a batch bowl, but I couldn't. I had no weed. So I kept myself busy. I started taking the gym seriously. Started drawing again (something I never thought I could do sober). Tried to slowly fix my eating habits and bargaining with myself to try and be healthy. Started reading books I'd put off and watched some anime on my to-watch-list. It was hard but I knew that if I could make it the first two weeks, I could give it up. Sure enough 2 weeks went by and I've made it this far, 1 year and 1 month later. I'm currently finishing high school online and have been seeing girls again. Your situations might be similar or drastically different than mine, but I feel these takeaways (as a product of my last year or so) can help anyone struggling to quit.

Takeaways: 1) Keep yourself busy, especially the first 2 weeks. It doesnt matter what youre doing as long as your able to throw yourself into it and keep your mind occupied. Throw yourself into school, into work, into that hobby you neglected. Read a good book, spend time with your pets. When bad cravings hit, you'd much rather be busy than sitting on the couch flipping through netflix. If you also smoke tobacco, they have a bad rep but fidget spinners helped me immensely. Cravings may be especially bad in the evening after work/school/etc so I highly recommend going for a walk, or eating outside/grocery shopping at night just to get you out of that headspace.

2) When bad cravings hit and you're not busy, turn to physical excercise and cold water. This helps for quitting tobacco too. Not everyone can just drop everything and go to the gym for an hour but if youre physically able, do some pushups. Get a pull up-bar. Do crunches and leg lifts (abs recover fast so you can go hard every day). After youre done, splash some cold water on your face. These two when done together wont magically cure your cravings, but it'll get your blood pumping and help you remember why you want to quit in the first place. 

3) Mental clarity/brain fog/dreams. For the longest time while smoking, I couldn't remember my dreams. I've come to learn that cannabis suppresses REM-sleep, which is when you dream. REM sleep is incredibly important for your mental wellbeing and your health, which is why a few days after quitting smoking you'll get super intense, vivid dreams. This is your body catching up on all of the lost REM sleep. If you previously relied on cannabis to fall asleep, try waking up early, exercising throughout the day, reading before bed time, taking small amounts of melatonin, and sleeping in a cold, completely dark room. If you can't sleep, get up and read until you feel ok to try again. Over time your sleep gets better and you start to feel the fog lifting, but it takes some time.

4)If you are currently suffering from any sort of mental illness and using cannabis, I'd highly suggest giving it up for good. After a few months of making better decisions, getting good sleep, and being sober I came to a place where I really enjoyed the peace of mind I have when I'm sober and I felt everything became easier to manage. I got off my benzos 6 months in(no matter how bad it gets I refuse to take antidepressants) and started to deal with my problems proactively instead or reacting to them with drugs. Waning off benzos was even worse than coming off weed but I felt like I could push through it. I started to feel like I wasn't in such a dark place. Things were looking up. If you have a therapist, please speak to them about wanting to quit cannabis cold turkey. They're able to help you in ways I can't and can have super helpful insight. 

5) Relationships become much easier to manage with a clear head and newfound confidence. Even if you suffer from anxiety, try patching your relationship with your family, even if your relationship with them is great. Please note that by family I don't mean blood relatives. Anyone who cares deeply about you is family. If you dont have any such people in your life yet, this can be a great opportunity to reach out and make connections. 


Tldr: Didn't have a super long relationship with weed but am young enough for it to have an impact on my mind. After my life fell apart, I quit smoking weed, tobacco and taking benzos by exercising when cravings hit, splashing cold water on my face and reaching out to people in my life. Quitting isn't easy, but if one person took one thing away from this post I'd love for them to understand quitting is worth it."
Life On Hard Mode,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i3rzde/life_on_hard_mode/,2020-08-05 01:14:42,"When you’re constantly high, you think you’re playing life on easy mode. You think you are escaping the inherent dread of human existence. Yet, what you don’t realize is that nothing in life comes free. Daily use is not a form of escape but rather imprisonment. You become nothing but a slave to impulse and your little rat brain will do just about anything to justify your addiction. 

Every task that should be simple becomes difficult. Every relationship you once cherished becomes strained. Every hobby you once enjoyed becomes boring. All the money you work so hard to earn gets flushed down the drain. With each exhale, everything that once made you you evaporates. 

It is clear this is no way to live life. Yet, it took me over two years to realize this.

"Taper taper taper taper & also, you should taper",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h92udt/taper_taper_taper_taper_also_you_should_taper/,2020-06-15 02:06:51,"Hey guys. I’ve been in this thread for a couple years just passively reading stuff. Now I’ve quit myself and have some advice for y’all, albeit kind of obvious. 

I’ll preface this by saying I’ve smoked everyday for the last seven years. The last time I didn’t smoke for more than 24 hours was when my baseball team made it to the state tournament my junior year of high school. I just graduated from college last month. There were points during my time in college where I would go through a gram of concentrates every day. 

Now, here I am 48 hours into quitting, and I hardly notice that I’ve stopped. All it takes is slowly tapering to keep at least the physical symptoms of withdrawal at bay. When I decided to quit, I was going through an eighth each day with an industrially large bong. The first week, I cut down to just a few bowls a day. The next week, one bowl during the day and one to go to bed. The following week, half a bowl during the day and finish the bowl for bed. Then I spent a week taking 1-2 hits per day when I really felt the need. Two days ago was the last time I smoked, and I slept like a baby each night since and have actually had a more normal appetite compared to while I was still smoking. 

If you are wondering why I quit, there are many reasons: it’s expensive; I need to find a big boy job; I admitted to myself that I’m simply not as sharp as I used to be; smoking started to exacerbate my anxiety rather than provide relief from it; my stamina in various sports is trash lately; and I wanted to be able to travel without worrying about the cannabis laws in a particular place. 

I know tapering off marijuana may be easier said than done, but if you’re serious about quitting not becoming a nightmare, it’s something to look into. It takes less effort to taper, in my opinion, than it does to lay in bed all night awake with cold sweats and an empty stomach. 

Y’all got this.

Edit: I think the main reason tapering worked for me is that I suddenly started having anxious reactions to smoking, and I slowly stopped seeing it as my safe haven. I totally see how tapering wouldn’t work for others, and I apologize if it sounds like I’m just telling everybody to do something impossible."
Start becoming addicted to clarity of mind,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/93qn7c/start_becoming_addicted_to_clarity_of_mind/,2018-08-01 20:45:20,"The title says it all.

The brain fog and numbness we all crave from weed are just misguided methods for us to feel more at home with ourselves and our Being. 

From the tumultuous negative emotions all the way to blissed-out euphoria, learn to love it all and accept whatever the moment delivers to your doorstep. Dance with the anxiety and cravings. Let the unpleasant thoughts in for tea instead of always trying to slam the door in their faces. They are impersonal, passing visitors who you can learn from.

In other words, let go of the need to 'control' your states of consciousness. We grasp so hard onto 'how things should be' we hardly ever truly appreciate how things *are,* right now.

Cultivate that awareness. You will feel more yourself. You will feel more alive.

Seven lies I told myself,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/huyd6u/seven_lies_i_told_myself/,2020-07-21 05:35:43,"I am on my 5th day of total sobriety, after months of tapering down with vaping only.

In order to sustain my addiction, I told myself many lies:

1. ""I need weed to enjoy food."" *Wrong. It made me seek out garbage food which is engineered to taste good but has poor nutritional value. I've discovered how great fresh, nutritious food can taste! Junk food is an addiction of its own.*
2. ""I need weed to sleep."" *Very, very wrong. Weed disrupts REM sleep. One night without REM sleep is fine. Years without it is hell.*
3. ""I need weed to be creative."" *I have creative hobbies. Weed makes me lazy and okay with not working on them. If anything, it makes me less creative.*
4. ""If my friends smoke weed, I need to too."" *I used to live with roommates who were fine with smoking all the time. It was a continuation of my college days where we'd all smoke together. Something better left for fond memories, not carried well into adulthood.*
5. ""If I can't handle life, it's not weed's fault, it's mine."" *Probably one of the most insidious. For the longest time I believed that weed has no negative mental health effects. The r/trees subreddit is dangerous in this way... people there are so used to advocating for legalization, they take it too far and lie about the negative effects.*
6. ""I don't have a lot of free time."" *Oh yes I do, I just smoke it away. Life's clock is ticking. I can either live a waking dream, or give up this fantasy and become the person I've always wanted to be.*
7. ""I need to enjoy myself every night."" *This is the hardest lie to face. A life of leisure may be the dream for some, but not for me. I aspire to be better every day, and develop my skills to their fullest.*

I got promoted a month ago. I took on many new responsibilities. My job requires me to be sharp, present, and responsive. All these qualities are marred by weed. There was no way my habits would allow me to do my job well. My sleep schedule was a joke, my temperament was poor, and I was often a stuttering mess during meetings. So I knew it had to go for good.

This got me thinking about other paths I want to walk in life. I want to have kids someday. I thought of what it would be like to be high while my kid was hurt or sick. It would make me horrible parent.

If I keep smoking and eating garbage, I'll never achieve the physique I want.

I want to take my creative pursuits to the next level. I'll never have the discipline to do this if I keep my habit.

The promotion was the last shock I needed. It's over, I'm not lying to myself anymore. You might see in my post history that [I tried quitting over a year ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9krr2d/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_i_wont_smoke_today_either/). I failed, because I was still lying to myself, and I had some severe emotional problems to work through. I'll post more about this soon. One of the first steps to evaluating your weed habit is to take inventory of all the things you tell yourself about it, because they could well be lies."

This is the time I quit for good. I'm afraid of what comes next.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/db3wyr/this_is_the_time_i_quit_for_good_im_afraid_of/,2019-09-30 04:45:56,"8 days clean. I'm not going back. I know that. And that's why I'm so scared right now. Weed was my companion, my therapy, my peace, my life. And for a while, it kind of worked. 

That's the thing about weed—it keeps you so subdued that you *almost* don't care who it's made you. *Almost*. If it weren't for that *almost* none of us would be here. But we know better. We know it's not right to need a bowl before sleep every night. We know it's not good to smoke a J on every occasion, good and bad. We know it's not healthy to only have friendships based on a drug. Hell, we know it's not good to ruminate on it all like this, but it's so goddamn hard to stop.

I don't know what problems you've been neglecting. But if you're here, you probably have a long list. For me, my social anxiety has spiraled into a black hole of loneliness. My depression greets me each month with a new layer of sadness that leaves me yearning for the last. My OCD intrudes new corners of my mind I thought were inaccessible before. And it just hurts, you know? They say mental pain feels like physical pain, and I really get that right now. Maybe you do too.

I'm starting to believe that's what keeps us smoking every time we go back. Not the fear of losing weed in our lives, but the fear of facing our lives head on. And the longer we avoid our problems, the scarier they become. It's not about weed at all. It's about our problems.

And that's why we have to stop. We owe it to ourselves to be terrified, to suffer, to mourn. To face rejection and pain and sadness. To let the lows be lows, so the highs can be real, not drug-induced. It's gonna suck. But we really do owe it to ourselves to suffer right now. We really do.

The thing is, the same way we snowballed ourselves into this situation is the same way we get out. If we can get this shit out of our systems, we'll have more motivation to keep going on without it. If we solve one tiny little problem in our lives, it'll give us the fuel to solve another. And another. And another. And so on. And really, that's happiness right there—solving your problems. It doesn't come *after* you solve them. It comes *as* you solve them. Because after you do, another set just falls in your lap anyways. 

I'm saying this for myself as much as I am anyone else: happiness is closer than you think. But it has to start here."
Met with a therapist today - surprised by the response on withdrawal,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/czrxsl/met_with_a_therapist_today_surprised_by_the/,2019-09-05 02:33:32,"I've been using to self-medicate for many many years and my quit has prompted me to start treating my mental health seriously. I've been open with my therapist about how I can't tell where I'm at emotionally due to the mood swings and general instability. 

I was surprised when she told me how seriously the mental health community is treating marijuana addiction and withdrawal now. How I will need to detox completely before any honest evaluation can be done because of the affect to my brain chemistry. 

I thought I was going crazy. It was amazing to feel heard I guess, particularly about the withdrawal symptoms. So many people have told me about the 'safety' of pot in regards to other drugs or otherwise tried to minimize the affects. 

She estimated that it would take around 6 months for my brain to return to homeostasis.

Or are you gonna stand the fuck up for yourself, accept that you let these problems linger for too long and tackle them?

Like your eyes, you need sobriety to see things the way they are and to achieve anything. Being sober is *fantastic* when you deal with your problems effectively.

I gotta say, it feels so fucking good to accomplish things that have been gnawing at the back of your mind for a while, especially after quitting weed. Thats the cherry on top. 

Im about to reach two months in and yet im nowhere near out of the danger zone of relapsing; there is so much on my plate that i still need to get done yet:
I still gotta keep my grades, gotta apply for university, gotta eat right, gotta get in better physical condition, gotta make new/better friends, gotta save up my money for a truck, gotta learn how to fix my bike, and plenty of other shit.

Youd be lying to yourself if you think you have nothing to do with your time other than smoke weed. Its important to have some sort of mental checklist throughout this process. It helps keep you preoccupied with your actual goals rather than getting high and putting them off until god knows when.

One thing that i realized is that its not all gonna happen overnight, and its gonna take quite some time to shape my habits in order to get some things squared away. In the meantime, i will **not** be smoking marijuana. I cannot do it all with a blindfold on. I need my eyes.

Just remember that when you accomplish everything you need to get done sober, then there is no need for the blindfold anymore."

I thought I would feel energized once I quit putting all of the substances into my body but I realize that the Lyme disease definitely has a hold on me. The reason I'm writing this is because maybe some of you have been discounting your feelings of fatigue and attributing them to smoking weed a lot when it's actually an underlying health condition.

It's only when I quit weed and suffered thorough a week of withdrawelz and bruuuuuuuuutal panick attacks, insomnia, sweating , rapid heart beat all day and just a general feeling of doom and fear ..........

Is that I now realise WEED WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ANXIETY. if I didn't smoke for a while then obviously I would start to withdraw (believe me I never even beleived you could experience withdrawels on weed), and for me the main symtpon of withdrawal is anxiety.

Now I'm on the other side of the withdrawal for the most part and I have 0 anxiety about anything. Sat in bed and my heart beat is super slow and super gentle and I'm just super chilled out.

I've been clean for about 5 weeks now. Prior to that I was a heavy user for 20 years. For the last 5 years I had been dabbing about a gram a day.
I was diagnosed with CHS about 10 years ago but deeply in denial and didn't quit until recently.

During the first week sober I felt terrible, of course.
After about ten days I felt amazing. My appetite came back, the constant feeling of sickness went away and I am once again able to enjoy foods that would previously trigger an episode of vomiting. I can even drink a little coffee and alcohol again, which is basically a miracle because for years those things have triggered intense vomiting and pain. At first, I felt the cloud of depression lift and I thought ""I am cured!"" 

The euphoria didn't last long. Now I feel more depressed than ever.
Prior to quitting I would bribe myself with dabs to get myself to work every morning. Since I've quit I've missed a surprising amount of work because I'm just too depressed to get out of bed. I struggle to do basic things like shower and feed myself. 

I'm happy to be over the hump but one thing I did not realize was how much I have been using cannabis to mask my severe depression.
I've had episodes of severe depression when I was using as well, but it wasn't as noticeable because I got really, really high to mask the symptoms. It was easy to blame being tired and useless on the weed instead of being depressed. Kind of like the pot was an excuse to myself for why I acted and felt this way. 

I have a great therapist and I go to therapy once a week. I also joined a gym and I force myself to workout for at least an hour a day. These things help take the edge off the depression but it still weighs on me, like wearing a wet coat that nobody else can see.

This post isn't really a question (or an answer) regarding quitting. I just wanted to share my experience with others who have quit and may be feeling the same way."

For Those of You Browsing Leaves..High..,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5ca1aq/for_those_of_you_browsing_leaveshigh/,2016-11-10 23:11:01,"I know for a fact there are an increasing number of people lurking this subreddit, but unable to make the commitment. I was one of you. 

This post is for those who--one way or another--ended up on this side of reddit, and think it might be a wakeup call for them.

It goes something like this--

**1st time visiting leaves**- *""Wow, there's a group of people that are trying to quit using pot? That's odd. How did I end up here again? Hmm..all of these people are struggling with quitting. I'm a pretty productive stoner. <takes a hit>""*

**2nd,3rd,4th time visiting leaves** - *""Hey I remember this place. <takes a hit>. Wow..this guy is claiming his anxiety and depression went away after he quit smoking. This one too. I know so many people that have used weed to clean up their own life, lol, even me. Weed is great, I don't have a problem. Weed is the only thing keeping me sane in this world. It's truly a miracle. <takes a hit>. It makes eating better, it makes sleeping better. Hell, I can't even talk with people without weed! Weed makes everything easier and more fun.""*

**5th time+ visiting leaves** - *""Okay why am I guilt tripping myself? I'm not these people. I don't have a problem. Weed makes my life so much better than it was...and besides, I could quit if I wanted to. I get all my shit done. Sure I have anxiety and depression, and yeah it's hard to find someone to date who also smokes as much as me..and yeah I have to hide it from my family and coworkers...but they just don't understand. Weed isn't the problem. I'm not the problem. They are...<takes a hit>..""*

You get the point. After lurking on leaves for probably 1 year+, and over 25-30 visits, I finally realized I was engaging in *self-deception*. Self deception is telling the doctor that you only drink 5 alcoholic beverages a week, when subconciously you know that you drank well over 10 last week (I have no idea about alcoholism, i'm just using random numbers). Self-deception is the voice of the addiction that says ""It's really not that big of a deal."" or ""John smokes twice as much as me and is a drug dealer, i'm a respectable citizen, I'm not addicted."" Self-deception is NOT something you are concious of...self-deception is something that your therapist will help you uncover (or hopefully this post..). Generally speaking, someone who is facing addiction will have 2 voices going on in their head. One will be a self-deceiving, justifying voice that says it's okay. Another voice will be standing to the side, urging you to take a moment to look at the facts surrounding your life. The second voice knows that something isn't right, and that there's a power struggle--a war going on in the mind.

This post is not to shame marijuana enthusiasts. This post is hopefully going to help ONE person who really needs to evaluate their relationship with weed. I don't know if that's you. But I can support you and answer questions if you're curious. If you don't have problems with weed, awesome. Seriously, that's great. But if you keep finding yourself ending up here over and over again...carefully examine your life...there might be a reason your mind keeps guiding you to this page.

**Are you controlling weed? Or is weed controlling you?**

Ask yourself the following (These won't be easy to answer honestly..):

* When's the last time I have been offered a joint, and said no?

* When's the last time I have enjoyed a hobby sober?

* When's the last time I have visited with friends and family, and enjoyed their company sober?

* When's the last time I have run out of weed, and been okay with it? Did I contact friends to see if they had some?

* Do I assosiate the things that I love, *with* weed? Aka, friendships are based on smoking, hobbies are based on being high for creativity, food and sleep are proportionally related to the amount of thc circulating through my nervous system...you get the idea.

* I get the gut feeling that something is wrong, but I often push it down and justify my use until I forget about it. Later on, I remember my gut feeling and have to work to push it away again...

* I often feel like getting high when i'm sober, but when i'm high I don't feel all that great...sure it feels good but a part of me feels like something is off. In order to try and avoid this feeling, I often smoke again before getting sober. 

* Do I often find myself scraping every last scrap of cannabis from my grinders/glass because I want to get high but don't have the money to buy more? Have I ever sold something of value or traded something for cannabis? Do I have an income that supports cannabis usage at my current level?

* When choosing a significant other, does weed play a role? If my loved ones mention my relationship with cannabis, do I defend myself or do I listen? 

**If you felt uncomfortable answering these questions, PLEASE evaluate your relationship with cannabis. You may be engaging in self-deception, just like me.**

It's not an easy pill to swallow, it took me years to admit how big of an impact it had on my life. Again, the last thing I want to do is guilt trip anyone right now. This community is ready to support you in every way, if you are ready. Best of luck, friends.

Today I went biking at Venice beach and it reeked of weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gg80d8/today_i_went_biking_at_venice_beach_and_it_reeked/,2020-05-09 07:35:22,"And while smelling it, I realized that weed can help and enhance other peoples lives, just not mine, and I am okay with that, and I am happy with that."
so glad i found this sub,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g7kwyv/so_glad_i_found_this_sub/,2020-04-25 05:27:07,"i've been wanting to quit for a while now, i used to be a very confident girl who loved nothing more than chatting to anyone and everyone. i started in university and smoked to the point where i totally flunked third year because i was an anxious mess that couldnt leave the house, paranoid thay everyone hated me. i've smoked 2-3 joints every day for the last 7 years and i finally had enough this week.

my mental health hasnt been great for a long time and i have always used weed as a crutch while also knowing that it was probably the main cause of my anxiety disorder. my self esteem and confidence have been wrecked and i've been told i'm a shadow of the person i used to be. i've always had a job but always felt like an imposter with this dirty secret which contributed to my low self worth and anxiety. 

i had a major panic attack a few nights ago that was triggered by a small joint before bed and i was flung into another attack as soon as i woke up. so i jumped into bed with my mother and we chatted about things until i eventually calmed down and something came over me. i grabbed my jar of weed, gave it to my mum and told her to hide it from me, (something i have NEVER had the guts to do before because the thought of not having weed would put me on edge) but something clicked in my head and i just dont want it anymore because it's ruining me. 

i'm currently on day three and had a really bad day, i felt like my mind and body were screaming at me for weed so i thought there MUST be a reddit thread to help with this, and here i am. this sub is exactly the type of thing i need, a support group to remind me that i am not alone in this, i have not ruined myself for life, and i can get back to the old me as long as i stick with it. i just want to say thank you in advance because this sub is already helping me just reading through others' experiences which made me want to share mine so far :) 

p. s. i'm surprised at how fast i've started dreaming again when i've had nothing but silence and darkness for 7 years, i forgot how real they feel!"
Recieved an E-mail Today from myself one year ago,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/f59fev/recieved_an_email_today_from_myself_one_year_ago/,2020-02-17 17:24:37,"So I recently stopped smoking cannabis (again) and it has been pretty tough. I'm on day 3 and having trouble. Today I woke up to an e-mail I wrote myself a year ago on [futureme.org](https://futureme.org). It's a website that allows you to set a specific date and time to send an e-mail to yourself in the future. A year ago today I had stopped smoking, and the e-mail was to congratulate me on one year smoke-free. My girlfriend and I just had a long talk about why this time was so hard, and we came to the conclusion that it was because I wasn't replacing pot with anything. I was just abstaining and it wasn't really working. I was still a bum on the couch. The timing on this is just such a coincidence that I see it as a sign. It helped me see what the positives are from not smoking, and that I have to get back into my hobbies in order to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and to really start practicing my recovery. It helped me see that I'm not doing this for my GF, my Mom, or anyone else; I'm doing this for me and for my benefit. I can't rely on my desire to please someone else to give me motivation, because that is not going to cut it in the long run. I have to take this journey for myself. 

&#x200B;

I really just couldn't believe that I just had a long conversation about the very same thing I wrote in an e-mail a year ago and received it today as soon as I woke up. I just wanted to share that. Maybe someone up there is looking out for me, maybe it's just a coincidence. But I choose to believe the former. Have a great day everyone, and good luck on your journey."

I feel my true self is lost in a maze. 

I can't get out, I can't see through the haze.

This cannabis kiss got me in a superficial blissful daze

haven't felt the joy of clarity in days

no, months!?

Goddamn, why can't I lay off on the blunts

Actually, its been years, since I was 14.

I feel I've been in a dream for 4 years

I've drifted so far from my peers

I hope one day the dust clears 

I hope I wake up from this dream

I hope one day my mind will feel pristine

All I can do is hope...

day 60 - an honest pro/con list,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bjvgmo/day_60_an_honest_procon_list/,2019-05-02 18:17:28,"PROS:

&#x200B;

\-education: can sit and focus on homework for longer periods of time because i'm not getting high to ""enjoy it more"", ""find it more interesting"", ""relax"" while risking paradoxical effects like racing thoughts, easily distracted, more interested in other things and then crashing and losing interest all together, getting sleepy, losing focus, becoming mildly anxious and depressed. now i can just......do homework and enjoy the content. furthermore, i can seek outside content. I can open up a web page and seek an article, google a definition, order a book without falling down a rabbit hole of distraction. finally, i'm not procrastinating. i don't have to spend time and money on the pursuit of weed anymore. i wake up excited for coffee and water and all of a sudden i'm naturally getting my shit done and this snow balls into more productivity.

\-relationships: i am present. i'm not fighting racing thoughts while holding a conversation. i'm not dodging eye contact because i'm paranoid my eyes are blood shot and eyelids heavy. i'm NOT LOSING MY THOUGHTS MID-SENTENCE - i seriously cannot believe this doesn't happen to me anymore. I'm witty again, i'm funny as hell. i'm intrinsically motivated to hear from others - to cherish others. i'm less negative about the world - i'm not walking around with a chip on my shoulder hyperfixated on the heavy sadness of others and the harsh possibilities out there - i always attributed this outlook to my naturally depressive disposition and intensely empathetic mind. nah man, it was just a side effect of weed - an apathy and paranoia toward the world. now my mind is naturally orienting toward beauty and happy moments - i never thought this could happen to me. i'm spending time with family, i'm not avoiding ill family members, i'm reaching out to old friends, i'm answering texts and DMs immediately rather than letting them sit for weeks just to never return. i planned a trip and ordered a game - i was present during these visits instead of planning when to smoke or planning the visit TO smoke. i'm no longer obsessed with ents - i'm obsessed with friendship. I feel better about myself. i was a crippled shell of a person while chronically smoking - i felt spotlight effect constantly, like everything i did and said in a group setting was dumb and everyone was staring. i no longer avoid group activities with the same ferocity.

\-work: i'm doing the most. because i want to. i'm not ""just getting by"" and fulfilling deadlines. i'm taking my professional and expertise seriously. i'm dressing for the occasion. i'm meditating before work (instead of smoking and planning the high out), i'm packing a lunch instead of ordering food or not eating everyday. i'm pursuing knowledge of superiors and uplifting coworkers because i'm not sad and negative anymore and i'm not paranoid. i'm sleeping better (still a struggle) but when i do sleep, its deeply.

\-health: i'm not using weed to support the pursuit of my eating disorder. i'm eating meals regularly and im in tune with slip ups in my recovery. i quit the gym (i was using it to get high and walk like a zombie to avoid everyone in my life while feeling false productivity). I will return to the gym someday but for now i set up a mat in my room to quietly get back to exercise for the right reasons - for health, not avoidance and vanity. im drinking coffee to enjoy it - not to suck it down to avoid a crash.

\-money: MONEY IN THA BANK

\-more pros include sex (sex was great on weed but sex has been amazing off weed), dreams (fucking christ i love the intense dreams. its proof im sleeping, its like living 6 different lives), reading books (i can actually read), art (i thought my creativity would diminish but its revitalized and focused), pride (pride of the knowledge i'm capable of sobriety and self-reliance)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

CONS (some of which include pros):

&#x200B;

\-education: i'm dealing with the mental realization that my 1.5 year grad degree was pushed to 3 years due to chronic weed use. i had previously attributed it to external factors like money, time, professors not helping me out. nahhhh, it was my inability to plan, to keep up, to gather motivation, to focus. i just need to stop beating myself up to this. it'll come with time

\-relationships: i miss smoking with people because it was a collective sort of ""between us"" thing. it was a weird type of bond to escape alongside someone else. whether that be ents or SO or best friends. this has been the biggest con and my toughest point of almost relapsing.

\-music: music and entertainment in general while smoking were pretty dope because i could hear every beat and fixate on videos/TV/movies. music is beginning to come back to me and a pro is that i'm seeking out more and more music. it might be a pro that im not so into other entertainment because im getting outside more now. and you know what? the quiet time i have now is.....beautiful and necessary.

\-unwinding: we all know there is no physical relief like that of an external substance over taking your body (the relief of that first puff, falling over all your muscles). well, it wasn't worth the mental anguish that short term and very brief relief gave me. now my whole day feels like relief.

&#x200B;

i'll edit this if i think of anymore salient ones. but overall, its beyond worth it. i have my personality back and my life back. i have my spark back.

&#x200B;

edit: i been pondering all day and one last con i can think of is: ciggs. i quit drinking when i quit smoking. and i quit xanax a bit before that. so now i'm sober. i smoke ciggs during social events to cope. makes me feel gross but fills a void. the good thing is because i kicked alcohol, weed, and xanax, i know i can motherfucking kick dumbass cigs. that is all, thank you."
One year clean today!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/awwlug/one_year_clean_today/,2019-03-03 21:09:13,That is all. 😊
Today l am 5 years free from cannabis addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8q67dq/today_l_am_5_years_free_from_cannabis_addiction/,2018-06-11 07:03:17,"It feels really good to hit this milestone, which l could never have imagined at the time. If you’re curious about my background l wrote a long post at [6 Months](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1t4pmh/6_months_detailed_story_ama/?st=JI9NMJ2V&sh=71df70e6https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1t4pmh/6_months_detailed_story_ama/?st=JI9NMJ2V&sh=71df70e6)

After five years l am living a completely different life now. Often with big milestones you hear people say “it feels like just yesterday” but for me it feels like a very long time ago because the growth I’ve experienced has been so massive. 

Most days l don’t think about it at all, and “ex-stoner”  just isn’t a significant part of my identity. Which is an unbelievable transformation because the drug was everything to me when l was still smoking, and quitting was a massive challenge that felt impossible.

For those of you who are struggling, know that this is (hopefully) one of the hardest things you will do. It can take a long time for the work to pay off but it is so worth it. 

Few people will understand how difficult this is, so if no one has said it to you yet, congratulations on making the choice to prioritize your well-being, l know how hard you’re working right now, and you’re doing a great job.

I know that when l quit it was always helpful to hear from others and know that it was possible to build a life without weed, so free to ask me any questions about my long-term recovery experience.

"Took Someone I deeply care about leaving me to see what the stranglehold weed has had on my life. I've been struggling to quit, until now. Today is my day one of a weed free life. (long post)",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/c2f0a6/took_someone_i_deeply_care_about_leaving_me_to/,2019-06-19 13:41:06,"My ex recently broke up with me. There were a number of reasons behind it, but one that stuck out was her saying how irritable i'd get from time to time, and how we'd only hang out when I wanted to, which made her feel forced to hang out on some days where she just wanted to have some time to herself. And it made me reflect on what she meant, as I didn't see the issues. 

&#x200B;

She doesn't smoke weed so whenever we hung out, I wasn't smoking. I am a going on to be 4 year daily user, I haven't been sober for anymore then 12-48 hours at a time in that 4 years. So whenever we'd hang out for a long period of time, i'd get cranky and moody, never understood why. I do now, now that i've had time to think it through, it was the weed. There were times where i'd try to get her out of the apartment so I could be by myself and get high, just because I could. I wouldn't be spontaneous with seeing her either, only hanging out when it was convenient for me (aka, when I wasn't baked out of my mind) 

&#x200B;

The annoyance and irritability has also spilled over to other facets of life as well. If i'm not baked, i'm cranky, short with people and just a bitter ass person. A shell of who I was before I started down this path. I understand why she dumped me. Which is why I vowed to get better. I've been working on other issues in my life (such as NoFap) and a little over two weeks into that, I'm ready to start taking on another beast that has taken over the drivers seat of my life. So, with me finishing off my stash last night, I'm officially quitting as of today. It's going to be a harsh, lonely journey as all my friends smoke. But i'm glad I at least have this subreddit in my corner for support. Let's do this."

4 months clean off weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bzyns4/4_months_clean_off_weed/,2019-06-13 03:54:43,"Hey there r/Leaves community, it's me again checking in after 4 months weed-free. 

I got on this sub right when I started my rehab program and used to write to people every night. It was super helpful to me because sending encouragement to others also encourages me. I haven't been here in a while but the four month milestone is a nice reason to celebrate. Give me a high five!

I continue to be SO HAPPY that I am not smoking weed every day. I'm so much more motivated to 'do my life.' I'm not depressed anymore. I enjoy people more. Things that seemed overwhelming are falling into place. I wanted to collaborate with people more, instead of doing everything by myself -- and I am collaborating with at least 2 different people in my career now. I used to be a Loner Stoner and now I have a lot more people in my life, which makes me happier.

The first 2 months of sobriety were marked by incredible irritation and annoyance with everything. The 2nd and 3rd months had a lot of anger and rage. This month I notice I'm so much calmer and happier. 

Not out of the woods yet, though. I am working on my childhood traumas with a therapist, (= lots of crying). I'm trying to move forward on the really important blocks that keep me from achieving what I really desire. Blocks I just ran away from when I was using. Now I'm not using, and I'm chipping away at them. 

Good luck out there, all you Leavers! Let me know how you are doing.

Exactly one year since I quit weed. Really proud of myself for this!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/fkp4bz/exactly_one_year_since_i_quit_weed_really_proud/,2020-03-18 16:58:59,A year ago I quit weed and replaced it with yoga and meditation and it was the best decision I've ever made. This community was really helpful. Happy to answer any questions about the process if anyone has any.
A letter to marijuana,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dih89u/a_letter_to_marijuana/,2019-10-16 04:28:56,"You gave me the best illusion that you were helping me. I trusted you. I held on to you. You were always there for me during my hardest and darkest times. I could always count on you to lift me up when things felt intolerable or when I just needed some company. You filled me with so many beautiful lies about how much better I looked and performed around you. I believed it all.

But what you didn't tell me was that you needed a part of me, every time you were there for me. As soon as I turned my back, you quietly and sneakily tore off a part  of my happiness, peace, laughter and desire to live, love and feel. You even asked me to make a sacrifice; leave behind any thing else that made me happy and forget about others around me. I devoted myself to you. I don't know if I could ever forgive you for taking so much from me and for making me feel like I need you. You took so much of me that I became invisible. I could not find myself anymore, even when I looked in mirrors. I only saw despair. 

 How could you deceive me like this? You would take me on so many magical trips ...our private get a ways...but you never quite took me back to my home. You left me in a lonely hole. A hole you dug deeper each time I saw you. I did not know your intention was to ultimately bury me in it. And so, I would continue to trust you because those trips felt so much better than being confined in that dark, troublesome hole where I only kept sinking. Where I had to sit with myself, my emotions, reality. It made me anxious. It made me want to runaway on another trip with you. I could not fathom feeling anything but the touch of you on my lips.

 Just. one.more.trip. 

but now I'm so deep in this hole that it has gotten hard to breathe. I know if I run away with you, you're going to continue digging it deeper until I can no longer see any light above me or have any air to breathe.

I have to get out of here. I can't stay here forever under your rule. But I have to get out myself and with no help from you. You lied and took more of me than I could have ever imagined. But you don't get to take any more. You have taken enough. And I need me back. I miss me. I miss living out in the real world. This hole is caving in.

 I saw the real you in your wicked smile every time you lowered me a little deeper into the hole.  You told me it was temporary but it never was. You promised the next trip would fix it all. And I believed you for years, let you control me. Although I could not see anything, hear anyone or do anything, the promise of you is what kept me alive in that darkness. I was ecstatic every time you pulled me out of there. You responded in a way no one else could. You comforted me. I simply could not get enough.

 But the rude awakening of how empty you have left me  has me furious at you and ready to climb out by my own means. I'm building myself a ladder. A step forms every time I say no to you. I'm starting to see more light. I'm starting to rebuild and recollect the pieces of me you selfishly took and carelessly scattered everywhere.

 I know it hurts you that I'm leaving, believe me, it hurts me too. So much that I almost want to wither away in this hole and forget this ladder idea. But that speck of light coming in from above this hole reminds me of the beauty of the real world. The beauty I have been deprived of for too long. Because you kept me to yourself. This beauty is what will keep me going, keep me climbing even when you try to kick me back down. I will get back up. I will never give up. So you might as well leave for good. I know I needed you before but I don't need you any longer, I am ready to live again."
"I did it my friends, one month today",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/c5fx55/i_did_it_my_friends_one_month_today/,2019-06-26 01:43:27,"And I can't explain what a huge change I have seen in myself. Now I see everything. Everything seems to connect now, why it was hard, why it was important to quit, everything. I'm never going back to weed. I'm genuinely scared of the power this seemingly harmless looking substance has on me.

&#x200B;

All of us here understand the rationale behind weed. It makes dealing with problems easier. But the problems don't go away. It's one thing to rationalize these things. But it's completely different to actually experience them. Like if I told you there is no self you understand it intellectually, but if you meditated for thousands of hours, you will see that experientially also.  That's when the point gets driven home. And  after one month, I see the point driven deep into my soul now.

&#x200B;

The most heartbreaking thing that happened to me was when I was talking to my ex yesterday and she told me ""If you had been a little more stable, I would have definitely married you"". She married someone else, and I'm honestly happy for her, but I know what she means when she says ""Being more stable"". In the morning I will get up with all the problems in my life staring right at me. And I'll say ""Today I'm gonna do something about it"" but in the evening I'll hit a blunt and then my thoughts will be like ""Problems? What problems?"". And this kept happening for three years. I would be sober in the morning, feel the load of ""I need to do something about my relationship, my job, my health"" and then smoke weed in the evening and forget all about them. Well too bad, time flew past and now my ex is married to someone else. But I learnt my lesson. I learnt it the hard way but at least I learned it! At one point of my life, it looked like I will never learn.

&#x200B;

Would you believe it, for years on a stretch, everyday I wanted to quit weed and everyday I smoked weed. Every goddamn day.

&#x200B;

Now I wake up in the morning and I do something about those problems. I talk to people, I go out. I have matured in my understanding of the world. I'm a very avid reader of Philosophy and for the first time in my life, everything I have read seems to make sense. As if I understand my life now.  I read and I write and I make music and I work and I'm calm the whole day. I had so much potential that I killed by just smoking weed guys. People far less qualified than me got promoted, and I stayed in the same place. And to be honest I don't even care about all of that. A prisoner has no time to think about the time lost in prison once he gets out. He's just happy that he's free. I just feel so different from what I was that I feel like I'm a different person. I got to keep all the good parts about me and made them better and I let go of all the bad parts. What else does it mean to live ""authentically""?

&#x200B;

And thank you to all of you, I remember one month ago I made a post here saying I would never be able to quit weed. I'll always be a slave and I just can't do it. Some kind stranger recommended that I install ""I am sober"" app. I did and it was an extremely difficult journey but I did it. I somehow made it, I don't even know how but I did it. I cried multiple times. Multiple times I felt that life is pointless. Multiple times I felt not only bored but actually dysphoric, I flirted with the idea of ending my life, I couldn't sleep multiple times. I cried multiple times. I had many difficult moments in this one month but I somehow dealt with all of them in every other way except by going back to marijuana. I don't know where the motivation was coming from but I just couldn't go back to weed. Anything but that. I choose problems in life, I choose pain over the illusion of no problems and no pain.

&#x200B;

Never again mate. Trust me. Life not only gets easier, it gets better without marijuana. There are plenty of people in this world who can regulate marijuana use. But I'm not one of those people. I'm someone else. I have other ways to be happy. Barring the extreme cases where you need it for some disorder or something, nobody's life depends on any mood altering substance. I felt like I have depression and anxiety and I have bipolar but all I had was an extremely unhealthy relationship with marijuana.

&#x200B;

All of these posts about marijuana are true. It might not look it but they are. I see it now after a month. Quitting is not the hard part. The hardest part is to start. And to start every time you fall. That's the hard part. I know it sounds patronizing but seriously this is my entire life we're talking about. Anything I say about life will sound patronizing. But just trust me on this one."

So it fills your thoughts with itself, and causes you to love it more than anything else. My friend told me this recently (his sister is a shaman and he's spent time in the community) and it really resonated with me! I feel its grips loosening on me, though. My mind is no longer filled with thoughts of smoking, and it feels so good!!! Just thought I'd share the perspective."

"The Stoner: Cool, Calm, Indifferent, (and falling apart inside)",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/28rg2w/the_stoner_cool_calm_indifferent_and_falling/,2014-06-22 05:07:23,"Like many other leaves, my use of trees gradually grew out of control, so I don't mean to suggest that the phenomenon that I describe in this post applies to all, or even most, people who choose to smoke. However, it does reflect my personal experience with trees, and the experience of several close friends of mine.

Fast forward through those exciting initial days of experimentation and occasional use, past the days of only smoking on weekends, and stop when you get to the point where you're smoking every day. You get done with work/school, and toking up is the first thing you want to do. The fire hits the trees, and all of a sudden life is easy and carefree.

But its not. All of the things that were stressing you out before you decided to alter your state of mind are still there. Waiting for you. Waiting for you to not be stoned so that you remember that you need to take care of them. 

Your friends are there too. And your family members. And they would be happy to talk with you and to help you confront the challenges that you are facing in life. But instead, you decide to do drugs. You decide to run away from your problems and from the people in your life who care, and you smoke instead. 

Your mornings are different now. You don't wake up excited for the opportunities of a new day. You wake up in a haze, crabby, and stressed about all of the things that you didn't take care of the night before because you got high instead. You go to work or class, you get through the day because you're thinking about smoking as soon as you can. And as soon as you can, you smoke.

Your problems are still there. But you smoke again. You don't care, no worries, its all good. Your stoner friends call you up and ask if you want to smoke. ""Why not?"" So you smoke some more. Pretty soon your stoner friends are the only friends who are calling you up. Those other friends, who wanted to be a part of your life, recognize by now that you've changed. Maybe they know that you're getting high all the time. Maybe they don't. But you're distant regardless.

You keep coasting through life. You don't really pick up new habits or interests, but you don't care. You're cool with the crew that you roll with. Your smoking buddies. Meet someone who seems cool but doesn't smoke? Too bad, they could have been a cool friend if they were down for the cause. But who cares, you light another one up.

Maybe one day someone says something to you that makes you question the path you're on. They call you a pothead or something. Maybe you get in trouble with the law. Maybe you just start to question whether you want to be the kind of person who does drugs every day. 

You start to realize that everything isn't so cool. You realize that those problems that you've been smoking away are a lot bigger problems now because you've ignored them for days/weeks/years. You realize that the only friends that you have left are the people that you get high with, and when you don't want to get high anymore, you realize that those people aren't really your friends anymore either. They are just other people who like to get high. 

You stop smoking for a couple days. You hit up your old (non-smoking) friends, but you realize that they've moved on with their lives while you were getting high. You realize that you smoked away months/years of your life, and that while you were gone, people filled the space that you used to fill in their lives. 

A lot of us here, me included, react to these troubling realities of marijuana abuse in the worst way possible: by getting high again to escape the pain. But this takes you back to where you were. Back to Day Zero. Back to the temptation. 

Only by recognizing and constantly remembering the harm that trees have done to our lives can we remain strong in our commitment to give up our old ways and rebuild our lives, families, and friendships. Only by rebuilding healthy relationships that don't center around getting high can we ensure that we won't go back to our old toking ways. 

Think back to the person that you were before you used trees. Who were your friends? What inspired you? What were your dreams? Who did you want to become in the future?

When you were a little kid, did you want to grow up to be a person whose sole motivation to wake up in the morning was to get high? Did you strive to be the guy who always shows up with red eyes, smelling like weed? The guy who always forgets things? The friend who fell out of touch and mostly just stays home and gets high alone now? The guy who had a lot of potential, but somehow, threw it all away to get high?

I know I didn't.

"I’ve been grounded for 7 years, made this user name today and this is my first post on reddit ever, but i wanted to share this with you",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dd24ki/ive_been_grounded_for_7_years_made_this_user_name/,2019-10-04 07:55:55,"Hello, i just found this sub today. I have been on Reddit for over a decade and yet have never had the urge to go through creating a user name and password and  actually posting anything. That was, until i found this sub. I’m on mobile so.. shit format I’m sorry.. 

I used to smoke every day when i was in college. I was your decently sheltered Christian kid that left the nest to become and engineer. Fast forward 2 years , I dropped two classes and failed two more because i was so fucking high  all the time, i didn’t have time for finals or hw. It was so bad i changed majors to poli sci just so i could stop taking “ hard math classes”. 

I got into my Roomate’s food, i would steal anything i found in the fridge while i was stoned because... well because food was just so good. I would start pasta and leave it on the stove, too stoned to remember it was on , only to find the house filled with smoke as my Roomate’s yelled “AGAIN”?!

I was fortunate... i began having slight panic attacks when i smoked that would leave me with a terrifying feeling of existential agony. I say i was fortunate only because it was an excuse to start cutting back. I started dating my best friend and got her to smoke as well. She never smoked and she ended up having a seizure(underlying medical condition we didn’t know about). That plus my panic attacks sent me into a very dark place..

I married that wonderful woman and she helped me get rid of pot from my life. I’ve had two kids since and one on the way. I’m fortunate because my career and family make it near impossible to smoke. But the reason i wanted to post here wasn’t because i wanted to vent.. or talk about my “victory over pot”.

I don’t consider it a victory because there doesn’t go a goddamn day that i don’t think about pot. For the past seven years I’ve wanted to smoke and have had to remind myself of why i don’t. I actually have dreams where I smoke and get baked. That’s all my dreams are sometimes, me sitting in a room ripping a bong  getting high and actually feeling stoned in the dream

Thank you for creating this sub. And i apologize for the wall of text.. i didn’t realize i had all that to share. It hasn’t been easy not smoking,  but  I know my life has been so much better than it ever could have been had i not given it up. If anyone wants to talk please pm me, I’d be glad to share my experience..

Stay low friends"

My experience regarding creativity after quitting weed (3 Months sober),https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bmy7k5/my_experience_regarding_creativity_after_quitting/,2019-05-10 17:20:33,"I've seen people ask this question several times, but it was always too early for me to answer it.

Now I feel like I can tell you something about my experience! I write a lot of poems, I write songs and I make beats. I will focus on the writing aspect in general, as it is the thing that I'm most passionate about. 

&#x200B;

I've been writing (a lot) for about 4 years now. During that time I started smoking a lot, until it became a problem and I quit. Now to preface this, I have never written anything good while I was high. I would always write something down and think ""Wow this is amazing!"" only to wake up the next morning and think ""this is bullshit, youre dumb/ stoned"" and delete it again.

I mainly wrote inbetween being high, so at work, on break, commute, before smoking, whatever. I would always have these sudden bursts of inspiration and had to stop dead in my tracks and write everything down. It felt like I didnt have control over it, not necessarily in a bad way, but thats just how I was used to it.

&#x200B;

I wrote a poem on the day I knew I had to quit and after that I wasnt able to write anything for over a month.

An entire month without writing! My day to day anxiety got waaaaay better, but I was stressed the fuck out over not being able to write anymore.

After a little over a month I suddenly had a very short writing session where, for the first time, I kinda had to write something. A couple weeks passed and I started to write a little bit more. 

&#x200B;

After two months of sobriety I wrote a really long and great song that I would not have been able to write had I not quit!

Even recording and yelling was fun sober! I almost cried recording it and I remember feeling the endorphins rushing my body lmao

&#x200B;

After being quite satisfied with my work I also felt reassured and was sure that I soon would be writing even more.

And now! May comes around! Holy heck! 

&#x200B;

I've been writing more these last 8 days than I have been in the last 6 months of smoking! 

And its not just a lot, the quality of my writing, rhymes and associations (association for me is almost completely the same thing as inspiration) have greatly improved! My brain is definitely healing and it shows. 

I also gained the ability to just sit down and write when I want to! I literally wasnt able to do that! Now I can just sit down, say ""I wanna write"" and do that with great results! It doesnt feel rushed, forced or out of my control. Now it feels like I own my brain and the clarity of my mind is really paying of. 

&#x200B;

Being sober is worth it! Many times I was anxious that I lost my ability to write, but it was never the case. Getting sober was the most severe case of that specific anxiety I have encountered so far, but god damn! Its better than ever, your head being free and fast WILL (in long term!) improve your creative abilities. 

&#x200B;

Stick with it, it will be worth it! <3 

&#x200B;

I hope I was able to reassure some restless minds, I love you all <3 You can PM me if you want to talk"

"Sobriety might not be easier than smoking, but that doesn't make it any less worth it",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/crwzkh/sobriety_might_not_be_easier_than_smoking_but/,2019-08-18 08:47:59,"I've seen a lot of posts on here where after quitting many people see a big reduction in anxiety and depression. This is great!

I just wanted to make the point that some people might not experience this. For example, my smoking was masking an underlying anxiety disorder. Being sober now, I have a lot of anxiety just like before I smoked. By smoking, I was essentially repressing my feelings. Yes, I felt less anxious when I was smoking, even when I wasn't high, but that doesn't mean I was mentally healthier. 

Repressing feelings and using a numbing agent every night can have serious consequences and will chip away at you!

By dealing with your underlying anxiety and/or depression, you can learn about yourself, increase your emotional resistance, and feel more able to step out of your comfort zone. This, combined with increased motivation, will allow you to accomplish so much more.

An added, and sometimes overlooked, benefit of quitting when you are masking underlying anxiety is that you are forced to find healthy coping mechanisms. When you can just get high and zone out, it's hard to find time or motivation to draw something or go for a run, for example. When you are sober, you will find ways to cope that are connected and fulfilling, not disconnected and numbing.

The reason I think this is an important point is that if someone quits expecting to feel 'cured', they may feel disappointed and relapse. Just remember: you aren't missing out on anything by quitting. You are gaining SO much. And even if you still struggle emotionally, your quality of life will skyrocket. That I can guarantee!

Throughout my smoking days, I smoked while listening to Mac more than any artist (other than Wiz). I used to drive around and smoke while listening to Mac for hours. When I heard the shocking news that he died at 26, the first thought that came to my mind was to smoke. I instantly wanted to smoke a blunt and reminisce. But, I didn't and am still sober. Mac Miller's death is a real tragedy, but he died from drugs. Weed is a drug. No, you can't overdose from weed and die, but, just like Mac, I'm a drug addict. Let's beat addiction. I can do it.

6 months off weed and cigarettes: getting better but still under mood disorders. Not going back.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/depzw2/6_months_off_weed_and_cigarettes_getting_better/,2019-10-08 01:22:22,"

At my early 50’s, quitting weed and cigarettes after 30 years. Reached 6 months off both, no relapse.

Positive changes after six months:
- I do not need to sleep more than 7-8 hours per day, instead of 10+ when I was “high”.  I do not even need an alarm any more.
- Breathing is now much better, no coughing, no short of breath. That makes exercise and meditation more fun, too.
- I feel much “cleaner” inside and outside. Not smelling bad, no gastro reflux symptoms, no blocked nose any more. 
- Since month 4, I also have a tendency for less alcohol, less caffeine, not too much meat. In month 5, I quit coffee, completely (after 35 years).
- No strong cravings for getting high any more.  

Of course, not everything is fine. I still struggle with:
- A periodic anxiety (comes every week / two weeks, stays for some days, leaves) which triggers depression. Makes me not wanting to work / avoiding decisions / feeling overwhelmed.  As time goes by, I think that it cannot disappear any more (I have been diagnosed with mild anxiety / depression, stemming from over-achiever mindset.  That, I was self-medicating with weed, after all). Acceptance, meditation and cognitive behavioral theory might fight my depression, over time. I will try to refrain from any medication, at least till I reach 12 months weed-free (doctors agree).

- Feeling less motivated than before. Working, playing music, reading, fixing things, even having sex still seem a little duller, not so rewarding, not so important to get me moving. Only teaching and presenting in large audiences are still excellent. Maybe that’s aging, after all :  Missing the extreme “high’s”, while enjoying the swallower “low’s” - it’s a good bargain.  I read that some of you got your motivation back after 6, even 12 months. I will wait.


What keeps me going, when I am not depressed:
- exercise (gym with a trainer and alone at home, I try 4 times / week)
- meditation (daily, 10 - 20 minutes, headspace app)
- yoga and qigong (once a week)
- traveling, both through my work but also with my motorcycle buddies 
- my supportive, caring sweetheart
- psychotherapy (monthly), although I feel it reaching a plateau after 7 years with the same therapist.

No meds, no nicotine, no cannabis, no caffeine.
Despite the struggles, I feel determined.
Any suggestion is welcome.

Hope I helped some of you, I feel you as my companions and I care for you."

I've been wanting to quit for several years and have been lurking on /r/leaves for a few months.  This morning I woke up and read some posts in this sub reddit instead of heating up my vape.

I've always considered myself a productive stoner. I own 3 fairly successful businesses. Married to a beautiful woman and have two kids that still consider me their hero.  

I've never considered weed an issue until several life events forced me to look internally at myself and my personal happiness. What I have been discovering is that majority of my success in life is external but internally I am largely a mess. Weed has been a huge suppressant and helped me avoid working on my emotional and mental happiness.

I'm turning 40 next month. My kids are getting old enough to understand what a stoner is and while my wife is very supportive I hide majority of my smoking from her. 

I don't really know who I am before because I've largely defined myself by my external success. 

I've been smoking for so long, I'm not really sure if anyone in my life knows who I really am.

I read another users post here about their 60 day challenge and how they read it takes that long to get all the weed from your system. I am committing myself to go sober for 60 days and see what happens. 

It's not going to be easy but I think it's about time I meet the sober me. "

Cabin life sans weed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/de4exl/cabin_life_sans_weed/,2019-10-06 19:06:58,"We have a little cabin getaway in the woods. (The perfect place to get high of course). About 18 years ago my spouse's alcohol use was out of control and our marriage was falling apart. We were each working full time and trying to raise three kids. We were beyond stressed and fought constantly. So we had this idea that if could just have a place somewhere to get away from one another (and the kids) it might just help us survive. So we bought this tiny cabin in the woods...
It worked! We did survive. (He stopped drinking). Marriage lasted. Kids all grown and gone.
But weed continued for us both - of course - the glue that binds many relationships. Until it didn't. I ran into massive anxiety and depression. Thankfully, I was able to finally recognize how my long term weed addiction was destroying all the good in my life and I quit on June 23rd. (Spouse continues to use and I have seemingly also adjusted to that). 
Right now I am sitting here - dog by my side - in the cabin on this chilly Fall day with a clear mind and feeling really happy and grateful. Life is full of huge challenges. Just counting my blessings this day - glad that my weed addiction is something I got a handle on. I never expected to be able to do so.
Good luck to you fellow leaver!"

Wish I knew what I was getting myself into when I was facing blunts everyday after high school,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/b1vl0p/19f_been_smoking_since_i_was_13_wish_i_knew_what/,2019-03-16 22:31:18,"Smoked for the first time when I was 13. Became a pretty much daily smoker when I was 15, usually smoking multiple times per day. Before high school, before work, before babysitting, before seeing my family. (Somehow I’ve made it to my sophomore year of college though my GPA is very much reflective of my burnout status)

Took me several years to figure out that my infatuation with weed was addiction in its finest form. My appetite, mood and sleep revolved around weed, and years later ironically I think weed negatively affects my mood, appetite and my sleep schedule along with many other things. 

After many many failed attempts, (the longest I’ve gone without smoking for the past several years is about a week) I am trying yet again to put down the bong for good. What I would give to go back and tell my younger self that this is not the way. Addiction is a tricky beast even when it is something as relatively benign as marijuana. Here’s to day 1. Here’s to strengthening my willpower. "

6 days of not smoking and all I feel is anger,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ejw03m/6_days_of_not_smoking_and_all_i_feel_is_anger/,2020-01-04 15:18:01,"It's this constant rage inside me that the world isn't as tranquil and as kind as it should be. Horrible things are happening just now and have been happening throughout the course of history and so many people don't give a shit as long as they are okay.

I don't care about my own life, I care about the cruelty others suffer. The good things do not absolve the bad or stop horrible things from happening due to us a species not being able to keep our shit together and get along. War has been present throughout history because people are inherently flawed and there are far too many of us. Most other species do not even come close to our numbers (insects and chickens come to mind as animals that outnumber us).

Just...urgh. I want to make a difference but going to help one family in Africa or one animal doesn't stop the large issues that we cannot solve individually. Governments need to change, but they won't.

At least when smoking I can zone out and not feel as frustrated. I don't feel anything else except anger and anguish. Who else feels like this and does anyone have any advice as how to channel this energy productively? I like writing but no one cares about what I write. It can't help anything.

Edit: I'd like to say a sincere thank you to all the love this post has received and all the comments as well. It seems a lot of people are or have been feeling the same way when quitting. It really helps hearing from you all. Today has been hard, but all your encouraging and empathetic comments have been amazing.

The bad news is if you think that by quitting weed your life problems will just disappear, you are in for a rude awakening.  It will not resolve your depression, make your zits go away, adjudicate your anxiety, cure your apathy, heal your physical aliments, or cause you to love yourself.

To make your life better will take reflection to identify what needs work, discipline to do what is required, and willpower to follow through.  In other words it will take a lot of hard work.

The good news is you have the power to do it **even if you are just at one day sober**!

How do I know? Chapter 33 from the Book of Tao (Tao Te Ching) told me so:

> *Those who understand others are intelligent, those who understand themselves are enlightened.*

> *Those who overcome others have strength, those who overcome themselves are powerful.*

> *Those who know contentment are wealthy, those who proceed vigorously have willpower.*

> *Those who do not lose their base endure, those who die but do not perish have longevity.*

You got this, now get to the hard work!

Quit smoking over a year ago... Here's how my life is different,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7xmoyf/quit_smoking_over_a_year_ago_heres_how_my_life_is/,2018-02-15 03:29:36,"1. Less paranoia. This is a big one for me. Smoking used to be something that calmed me down and helped me live in the moment. However, over time it quickly became something that made me even more anxious and paranoid socially. Living in a state where it's illegal didn't help.

2. More productivity. Cannot over-exaggerate this. I used to smoke and just want to chill for hours at a time. I would vibe out to music or sleep. Now, I read books, study, and even learned how to cook. 

3. Clearer mind set. When I smoked, I felt like I constantly had a cloud over my head. It became impossible to focus on a task or learn anything. Even the day after, i would get hangovers that would make it difficult to focus and get anything done. Not a good thing when you're in college, pursuing a PhD 

4. Better outlook on life. When I smoked, that's all I looked forward to. I would literally suffer through the day, with going home and getting high on my mind. This is no way to live. It's literally hell.

5. Better relationships. My relationships with people are much more cohesive and meaningful. I can get to know someone without fear of judgment or prejudice. When I was a stoner, I could only hang out with other stoners. It really sucked, honestly.

Overall, I'm glad I quit. I still miss it sometimes, but I remind myself that my life is truly better without it. When a drug starts to take over your life, that's when you know you're in trouble. Weed became my coping mechanism, and it made everything else in life seem dull or uninteresting. I couldn't listen to music, have sex, or hang out with friends without smoking. Now, I can do all of those things drug-free and truly enjoy them for what they are. I hope this helps motivated some of you to quit. It really will help you in the long term. Peace. "
And they say marijuana isn't addicting...,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ei5dre/and_they_say_marijuana_isnt_addicting/,2019-12-31 19:52:58,"In 3 hours I will be 48 hours sober from marijuana.  When do I stop wanting to not exist anymore?  The feeling that I want to rip my hair out and slam my head into walls while sobbing is a near constant companion right now.  I've barely slept the last two nights (although I did have a sex dream about Adam Driver last night so not totally mad about the REM thing) and threw up from DRINKING WATER yesterday...wtf?!  I'm doing the things like keeping busy and dealt with this feeling throughout all of it (including teaching 2 yoga classes, 2 hot baths, a gym session and a sauna).  To be fair, I chose to quit while premenstrual so I would be a bit emotional with or without weed, but I feel like this is all a little extreme.  

I started smoking when I was 15 years old, I am nearly 28 now.  I'm your typical all day every day user, often spending the last of my money on weed or resin hitting when it's not an option.  This will be my second time quitting.  First time I chose to quit because weed had taken over my life and I recognized it.  I stayed sober for 2+ years!  I started smoking casually again in 2018 and before I knew it, it had full control of my life again.  This brings us to now.  I bought an ounce on the first on the month thinking I could ""budget"" about a gram a day... Nope.  It was all gone by the 20th AND I was gifted multiple cartridges and smoked out plenty during that time.  I don't want this to be my life.... Plans revolving around weed, coughing all the time, smelling, eyes red, slow reaction times and contentment with a life I should definitely not be content with yet.  Originally I thought I'd just take a short break, but I don't ever want to feel like this again.  

I got on this forum yesterday and am so grateful I did.  I don't like that you are suffering too, but it does feel good to know I'm not crazy or alone.  You're not either."

So I'm *almost* a doctor. I graduate medical school this May, right before I turn 32. All my exams are done and passed, and I have about a dozen residency interviews lined up, enough to pretty much guarantee me a post-graduate position this coming July. I go to a US mainland MD school and will be going into internal medicine, then subspecializing probably into critical care. That's where I am now. Let me also tell you where I've been.

This story involves me making a TON of bad choices. Everything here is 100% true, and that's why I'm using a throwaway. Text posts get no karma. This story will begin in my teenage years, so there should be something for everybody. This is for you guys.

Now buckle up. This is going to be a ride.
___

**The Beginning: Ages 16-18**

I first smoked when I was 16. I fucking loved it. I felt like I had found a great secret and I resented the adults for trying so hard to keep it from me. By the time I turned 17, I was having friends over in my garage every single day after high school to smoke. I was caught a few times by my immigrant grandfather and mother. They were extremely disappointed. My mother cried. 

It was senior year in high school and my sleep schedule was getting fucked up. I stayed up late and fell asleep in class frequently. I started skipping school. I used to have elaborate tactics to make noise leaving in the morning so my grandfather would think I was gone, then sneaking back through the window just to go to sleep again. Of course, I never missed a smoke sesh in the garage, or wherever. We hotboxed my car so many times, just driving around getting stoned. I'm so lucky I never got pulled over. We would drive for hours and hours almost every night.

It was around this time that I developed a shoplifting habit, sometimes for the necessity, but usually for the thrill. Manager caught me once, but I wasn't arrested. Yet. I was spending a lot of money on weed. I would ride my bike a few miles to get it on occasion.

Luckily, my decent work junior year had gotten me into my first choice school. I graduated and went off to live at college.

___

**The Collapse: Ages 18-19**

College had none of the structure of high school and this was bad for me. My roommate smoked, but he was responsible. He could put it down. Me, all I did was smoke and play Counterstrike. All fucking night. I had developed an anxiety about going to class, where missing one would turn into fear of showing up again, and that would perpetuate further. I would miss exams. I failed all my classes the first semester.

I had no social life to speak of. I wasn't cool. I was weird. I *somehow* managed to charm a girl while there. Let's call her Mary for now. She'll come up again.

In January things got bad. I had landed a job at a lab on campus, and continued my sticky-finger habit. I took a bottle of 95% ethanol (drinking alcohol, lab grade) and stashed it in my room to take back home with me next time I went.

A girlfriend from home cheated on me at the time. It was very rough, but of course I medicated with weed and hash as well. One night I was brazenly smoking in the middle of campus, in a gazebo, not even hidden with a few friends. Someone reported us. The cops came to my room, found my little corncob pipe,  but no actual weed. I was still scheduled to receive whatever disciplinary action they would give. Except something else happened.

The very next day, I smoked more hash. Then I started talking to people down the hall. Bragging about how I had stolen the ethanol. The RA heard me. I tried to play it off, probably arrogantly. He wasn't having it. He was a pot smoker as well...rumor had it he was admiring another classmate's vaporizer down the hall. But he wasn't cool with me. Sept 11 had just happened, so he heard that I had stolen ""lab chemicals"" and probably thought the worst. He called the police, the police called the hazardous waste disposal people. It was a major scene.

Now here's another fucked up part. I had the munchies from the hash, so I ordered Chinese (before the whole scene went down). While I was on the phone with my order, I heard the call waiting (old school throwback for the people who knew landlines). I would later find out that it was my ex, the one who had cheated on me. I didn't pick up because I was busy with my order. With a simple landline, you had no way of knowing who it was that called you. I'm willing to believe that my big mouth was a part of my personality. Maybe I would have still bragged if I didn't smoke. But I sure as hell would not have had the munchies, so I would not have called for the Chinese. My ex would have gotten through, and we would have probably had a drawn out, depressing conversation. I would have never had the chance to go bragging about that ethanol.

I was arrested. I lost my housing. I was suspended. I was on academic probation from failing the first semester. The suspension was for a year, but the academic probation terms demanded that I come back in the summer to raise my GPA or be dismissed from the university. The suspension prevented me from doing that. I made this point clear to the disciplinary committee, but they didn't care. I think I was still trying to defend my actions, admitted that I was wrong for stealing but claiming that everyone was overreacting about the threat I posed. This is why they had no sympathy for me.

And so, I was academically dismissed from my state university. I never told my grandfather the full story, he just thought I was back home because I wanted to be. My mom knew. Disappointment everywhere. And I kept right on smoking, more than ever.

___

**Stoned Pizza Boy: Ages 19-23**

I took the only job I was qualified for: delivery driver. To give myself purpose, I decided to try to be a musician. I had been playing guitar for years and was in bands in high school, so I decided I would try it again. The musician lifestyle is very compatible with drugs too, so it was a win-win. 

Somehow I reconnected with Mary and we started dating. She saw the whole thing go down at the university. In fact, she was in the room when I was bragging about stealing the ethanol. For some reason, she accepted me. I was grateful for this. I loved her.

At this point, I continued the trend from college of only making friends who smoked. Anyone else didn't have enough in common with me. Pot was everyday. It was a staple, a necessity. I enrolled in community college mostly to make my grandfather happy, but I knew my life in academics was finished. I would withdraw from classes, not go...same shit as before. Only this time I had the presence of mind to drop classes before I failed them. 

I would smoke on the job. I had my Visine which I was convinced had the magic power of making me look completely normal while I was high. I drove around high *so* much. Again, lucky to never get pulled over or into an accident. I got my friend a job at the same pizzeria, who was just as bad a stoner as me. We smoked on the job together, then went back to my place to smoke more after work. We would just smoke and watch Adult Swim every damn night. I don't remember what those years were like. They were all a blur. I did nothing. I *was* nothing. I lost my early 20s to the fog that weed turned my memory into.

This is when I truly got addicted. I would experience high anxiety when I was not able to smoke. I tried to quit a few times by now, but failed. I remember being a little successful one semester when I was trying to transfer back into the university that kicked me out. I maintained my full-time community college schedule that semester and managed to *moderate* but not quit my smoking. Instead of finishing a whole bowl while I studied, I would only take a puff. It kept me going. I got straight A's that semester in some soft classes...sociology, speech comm, etc. I tried to re-apply to the university but they didn't want me. Back to dropping classes and smoking heavily.

By the end of this period, my mother had remarried and moved an hour away. I was living with my grandfather but he was fed up. Seeing what a piss-poor grandson I was, he decided to move back to his home country where the rest of his family could take care of him. He would sell the home I was raised in. And I don't blame him. 

I was on my own.

___

**Rock Bottom and the Turn-Around: Ages 23-26**

I found a job as a lab technician after moving out and made a strong point to myself to NOT steal anything. My salary was about $33k.  At this point my shoplifting habit was long-gone, but I was now a private smoker. Since leaving my hometown, I had ostracized my friends. I would do my 9-5 job, come home, eat junk food, smoke alone, and play video games. Nonstop video games. I had a band that kept me occupied a lot, which was good, but we weren't going anywhere. I was a fat lead singer. I had no discipline.

Sometimes I would make the hike back to the hometown, about an hour's drive oneway, to get weed from a guy I knew. I wasn't meeting new people in my new location. I would drive all that way for just a 20 bag sometimes. Then I would come home and smoke a fat joint by myself while playing an MMO. This was every night except nights that I had band practice or was playing a show. Of course, there are easy opportunities to smoke during those circumstances as well.

Worst of all, Mary was getting pissed off. She would occasionally smoke with me, but she was frustrated with the nothing that I was. When she took a job as a drug counselor, that was enough for her. Thinking that she was just being uptight, I let her walk off without trying to stop her.  

I hit rock bottom when I saw she started dating someone else a few weeks later. It really makes it hit home when you see them move on, doesn't it? I was now totally alone, in a foreign place, with no future. The weed no longer helped. It finally encountered a sadness even its potent hypnotic qualities would not allow me to forget, or even have a moment of respite from.

I didn't quit right away, though. I actually doubled down. I reconnected with all my friends and we, collectively and magically, embarked on a 3-month long bender filled with alcohol, weed, and A LOT of Adderall. The appetite suppressant effects of the amphetamine coupled with my already dwindling appetite from losing my relationship helped me shed the weight really fast, so I leaned up. 

At the end of this period, I had a moment of clarity. I lost so much to bad discipline and low ambition, **and the weed made me feel okay with that.** It was time to embark upon the path to redemption. It was time to scrape together whatever small chances I had left at succeeding in life and run with them. I would go back to school. I would get Mary back. I would make my family proud.

___

**Recovery, Redemption, Regret: Ages 26-Current**

I villified the weed to stay away from it. The first thing I did was go to Marijuana Anonymous. They helped me realize I was on the other side of that fence. I was with them. I almost broke down crying at that first meeting. I didn't go to many meetings after that, but that really left an impression on me. For a year, I didn't smoke anything. I directed my mind towards my other goal of going back to school. I decided to go back to what I wanted to do as a kid: become a doctor. That's the idea I had when I applied to colleges. I aligned my life with this new purpose and made the conscious decision that weed was not compatible with this purpose. Into its success I tied all the things that caused me sadness before, all the things I would fix...basically everything that was taken away from me, including my family.

I barreled through my classes at the community college, and got straight A's to earn the associate's degree. I paid a lawyer to get my arrest and the corresponding charge from the university expunged from my record (and no it has not turned up through multiple state and federal level background checks). I transferred into another in-state university, deciding to entirely snub the one that kicked me out. At that university, I graduated summa cum laude with  GPA of 3.9. I applied to med schools, and during the application year waiting to hear back I also did a master's degree. Molecular genetics were both my BS and MS. 

Med school applications require a reiteration of your **entire** academic history, so of course they saw what happened when I was 18. But there was a fantastic blessing in disguise. Because the suspension and probation occurred together, they resulted in an ACADEMIC dismissal. So with a now clean criminal record, a transcript of failing classes the first year, and an academic dismissal, it was very easy for me to tell a story about an undisciplined boy who didn't recognize the merits of a college education. And that was 100% true of course. But I sure as hell didn't need to talk about stealing ethanol, and I didn't. Unethical? I don't think so. I knew I had changed. I knew I was not a threat to anyone or their property. I knew I had learned valuable lessons. They would have just drawn poor -incorrect- conclusions if they had seen that.

One school interviewed me. That same school accepted me. I made it in by the skin of my teeth. That first year nearly ended me. Even with my summa cum laude, even with my master's degree, even with an MCAT above the 90th percentile, I almost didn't make it. For those of you who know about this process, it's worth it to mention that I did NOT apply to the slightly less competitive DO and much less competitive Caribbean MD programs. The acceptance came early enough where I felt I didn't need to.

For a year the weed did not enter my lungs. If people were smoking, I would leave. The first miracle was that I did get Mary back. My friends were amazed. She saw the change, saw where I was headed, and decided that she did want to be along for the ride. 

After the first year, I allowed myself some in curiosity just to see how it would affect me. It was still early on my academic path so I had a lot of momentum still going. Maybe that was the reason that I found that weed had no more control over me. I could put it down. Sometimes I didn't like the way it would make me feel. 

Now, I can take it or leave it. Sometimes I deny it just because I know I can. Just to flex my muscles, in a way to say, ""Hey, remember me? You've got nothing on me now."" I've been this way, confidently, for about 3 years, ever since starting med school I guess. This is where I feel I've turned the corner and my brain chemistry is so different that I can **never** go back to the place I was with weed. Either I'm too busy, or I just flat out don't *want* to be.

I'm 519 days stone cold sober save my 2 cups of coffee in the morning.  I quit smoking and quit drinking at pretty much the same time.

For those who just began the journey, the first 2 weeks suck.  Once I blasted through that things got a lot better.  Memory came back with time, I was pretty much a daily smoker for about 5 years and a heavy smoker for the last 3 of those and I was convinced my memory was shot.  That said, the more you use it the better it gets.  I still get cravings here and there but I'm happy to live a motivated life not built around hitting the pleasure button.  My happiness comes now from the things I do in life rather than the things I buy/consume.

It's a slow road but it's worth it.  It still feels like yesterday that I sobered up.  I couldn't have done it without some of the stories on this sub.  By the time I hit 90 my smoking days were in the rearview.  Keep fighting the good fight!

Been smoking for over 25 years. Not my first time quitting. 

The pandemic and lock down put me in a bit of a tail spin.  My office permanently closed down and working from home means I'm smoking twice as much.

I have a cabin which we go to on weekends and I stopped bringing weed the last few months.

I tried putting all my gear in box which I taped up and stuck on a top shelf in my garage but after a few hours I was ripping the box open.

Headed to the cabin for a week a few days ago, so I threw the box in the garbage before I left.

So that's where I'm at. No expectations.  Weed is legal here and the depression is mighty, so it's far to easy to replace that box.  Determined not to.

Quitting weed uncovered a serious peripheral arterial disease,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ccdjyd/quitting_weed_uncovered_a_serious_peripheral/,2019-07-12 21:04:57,"I'm now 48 days sober. I fortunately passed beyond all the psychological effects of withdrawal as I mentioned in my previous posts. But, I started to observe symptoms I always neglected while stoned. In other words I started to listen to my body after quitting. I started to pay attention to the pain in my legs on walking and the tingling sensation in my feet at night. Im diagnosed as having PAD. The serious conclusion is that weed is so destructive in this regard. Minor symptoms of serious diseases can be numbed both physically and mentally with weed which is another signicant reason to quit.

Edit: one more thing is that while on weed I would prefer car over walking. I would never exercise. After quiting things have changed and my reliance on my own muscles made symptoms more obvious."

My dreams are still crazy vivid, but my sleep is so much better. When I was smoking weed I guess I never got much REM sleep. 

Productivity could still do with some more improvement, but I am still a lot more productive than I was a month and a half ago. I get out more often, and I’m able to socialise with people without feeling like an anxious mess inside. I’ve also had less angry outbursts this past month. 

Overall I’m feeling good, but I know there’s still more progress to be made before I can get back to feeling completely at peace with being sober. I still miss smoking weed. Every now and again I’ll get a whiff of it when I’m out and about, and I do feel pretty sad about not being able to smoke. If you offered it to me now though I’d definitely turn it down. 
 
Anyhow, sorry for the mini rant. I wish everyone the best in their own endeavours. Just remember that the longer you stick it out, the easier it gets."

Even if it's just ""Hey"" ..or here's a good one if a simple ""hey"" is too informal for the amount of time you've ghosted someone: ""Hey, I know it's been a while since we've talked, but I saw _____ and it reminded me of _____.  Hope you're doing well.  Would love to catch up sometime""  or something like that.  Trust me the sooner you do it the better and you may even be able to pick up where you left off.  It's too easy for a stoner to let time pass. One day you'll look outside the cloud you've been in and realize too much time has passed to simply just text them and pick up where you left off. 

You don't want to be like me and have no friends anymore or cut ties with people for literally no reason other than you're high.  It's a tough pill to swallow. "

Long time smoker on 10 days no THC! and my first reddit post!,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/e7w0lo/long_time_smoker_on_10_days_no_thc_and_my_first/,2019-12-08 19:51:32,"As the title says I’ve never posted on reddit, still trying to figure it out- its definitely a world unto itself. However, when I found this sub I found the reason I was randomly scrolling this site.

ME: 41(f)-started smoking at 15 after being sexual assaulted while intoxicated on alcohol. I couldn’t stand the smell of alcohol after that- always reminding me of the event. 

Shortly after I found a new comfort. MJ became a life saver or at least a band-aid for a good long time. Spent the next 10 years smoking daily. At 25, I met a man who didn’t smoke, very straight edge in general. We got married, had three kids. 

Hey, guess what? Marriage to a mismatched partner during a traumatized and addicted state of life isn’t going to solve your problems- even if you lay down your crutch, temporarily. I quit smoking for 8 years while having my babes and trying to forget why I ever smoked in the first place.  That worked for a time.  Financial struggles forced  me back into restaurant work, waiting tables again, but now with 3 kids under 6.  

Cut to 5 years later... you know the story. Went from one bud given to me by a coworker, feeling- boy I won’t do that again; so guilty and scared that someone in my straight edge, conservative christian life would find out.  To a month later I asked my coworker for the number of his plug . I had a steady connection, cash in hand- my sweet old friend coming back to save me from myself.  All the while, I KNEW it was going to be struggle to give this up- I had lived it before. 

In my world, a habit like this meant I had to sneak, lie and hide. My husband was/is absolutely against the use of even the mildest of drugs- for a while insisting that even anti-depressants were bad for your brain.  

I always wanted to quit. Knew this is a ridiculous waste of time, money and energy. I was embarrassed- even amongst smoker friends who couldn’t understand how I went through my stash So. Damn. Fast.   They were always telling me -“just don’t smoke so much- pace yourself- make it last”.

I don’t think I need to explain to anyone here how or why I just could not, why it was never that easy.

Today- I am here. After a year+ of therapy, a diagnosis of bi-polar 2 and proper medication- I began to feel like it was possible to say goodbye to my friend again. Even still, I spent more months and months psyching myself up for ACTUALLY quitting. I knew it my heart that I WOULD do it....as soon as I mentally could handle it. I trusted myself that I would know when it was time. I credit improving my mental health, meds and therapy to get me to the point that i felt ready. I ran out and haven’t gotten more. 

Day 10: the first week was everything I expected: diarrhea and nausea, hot/ cold sweats, shaking, and sleepless at night and exhausted all day, no appetite. 

Week two- god help us- I’m in the “everyone must die” phase of irritation and anger.

I check in here everyday, throughout the day, just to remind myself that this is real, other people are going through this and I CAN quit! My best friends roll their eyes at the idea of having withdrawals from pot. But HELLO r/leaves FRIENDs!! This is no joke- just reading about others who are experiencing this too gives me strength. I don’t feel so alone in this. Thanks for the community. 

EDITED TO ADD: I also left my husband 7 months ago which gave me the space to deal with this on my own terms. Do what you’ve got to do.

TL:DR ( had to look up that acronym -ha) : 

1. Daily, alllll day smoker finally makes it 10 days after 25 years of off and on dependency.
2. This is real, it is hard, but we all deserve true comfort, real healing and authentic, unfiltered connection with the world around us. 
3. **I began by noticing, to myself, that each time I smoked *nothing in my life had actually changed*. ALLL  the same shit I was “escaping” was still there. 
	LIKE THIS:  “Hey lady, look inside, look around you — smoking hasn’t fixed anything, changed anything, or actually helped you in anyway. In an hour, 	when you want smoke again, that will still be true.”**   
	This helped a lot with the slow process of facing facts and removing the disillusion that marijuana made life better in any way."

Reasons to not smoke right now,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5mq7t4/reasons_to_not_smoke_right_now/,2017-01-08 13:09:14,"I'm writing this for myself in the future, but I hope this helps someone else:

Hey. So you wanna smoke. Maybe it's a good time to do so and there are friends to do it with. Maybe you're feeling like you need it to relax and enjoy yourself. Maybe you just feel bad about yourself and need a pickmeup. 

Well, hold up. You've been here before. I'm not saying that you can't smoke right now; you know your situation better than I do. But I do know that you wanted to quit and let your brain reset, and you don't like how dependent you are on weed. You'd rather generate your own joy than get it from a chemical. You prefer the steady clarity of your pure mind than that childish fog that you know so well.

So let's go through it. Stick with me: hear me out. Let me tell you why you don't *need* to smoke right now, based on hundreds of our own observations:

- It'll tire you out tomorrow. You will be slower and less out-going; you'll miss opportunities.
- You will feel anxious in about 5-15 minutes. You will feel less socially capable and more self-critical.
- You will look less good and feel less good about your appearance. Your eyes will look really messed up.
- You will sound dumber and your vocabulary will be severely diminished. You will struggle to find words for your thoughts and you will lack the memory to give thoughtful responses.
- You will not be able to read people as easily or form emotional understanding. You can't even make eye contact when you're high.
- You will become less motivated to do the things you need (and want) to do.
- You will feel very guilty for betraying your past selves, sabotaging your future selves, and impairing your current self. And this rightfully should bring you guilt and a sense of shame.
- You are showing people (your friends, family) that you are a drug-addicted loser who can't beat his demons.
- You are basically burning money and inhaling it into your already-weak lungs.
- You are wasting time (precious!!!) and ruining your mind (priceless!!!)

So think carefully. You can do this. Make the right choice.

Love,
You

EDIT: Thank you to everybody who this post has helped - it feels humbling knowing that I am on this journey with all of you. You made me realize I can actually do this. I have accepted that I must change and so I can finally say that I'm quitting for good. Previously, I was never 100% but this time I am fully certain that this is what I want for my future. This is what I must do for my relationships, my health, my finances, and the life I want to build. 

I know it will be rough at times but I am relentless. I am a fighter and I will conquer the weaker versions of myself. I lose when I give up. I will never give up and I will never lose. Best of luck to everybody in the same fight and I will update you on my progress in a week's time.

It's happening and it is for real this time. The philosophizing is over; time to start *doing*."

Me like the rest of you loved weed, it’s the perfect antidote to a hard day at work, it makes you forget about any problems you have, it makes life fun in the moment. 
Initially when stopping I found myself bored as shit on the sofa, wondering how to get through those hours between work and going to bed. Pick up a book, go to the local bar/pub, go meet that friend you always planned to meet when high, go and do that run that you told your high self you needed.
Weed is a great social lubricant. Most of my closest friend in uni smoked. We forged close relationships around smoking, but I also lost connection with other friends who didn’t smoke.
If you’re here considering stopping then you’re much better off than a lot of the (don’t mean to be rude) deluded stoners. Weed isn’t bad for you in the short term, it helps you get through the day. It helps you relax after a day at work. It helps you enjoy the thing you normally do. 
But is that right? Is it right to live your life in a haze? Would you pay a $10-20 subscription a day to “enjoy your life”?
You’re not enjoying life, you’re just getting through the day - constantly looking forward for that next spliff.
Take that step
Take control 
Choose freedom

200 DAYS WEED FREE. Thoughts and realizations.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dq7vqp/200_days_weed_free_thoughts_and_realizations/,2019-11-01 22:02:46,"DAY 200. What I have learned: I used to convince myself that pot helped me in certain ways, which I clearly see now wasn't the case. I was convinced it helped curb my anxiety. The truth is, it often exacerbated it. Both my depression and anxiety are under much better control now. I also am way more productive. The first couple weeks I was bored shitless, and thought, well, I need to find something to do. So, I started writing songs and am working on a solo album, and I am able to see projects through. I also think much clearer now and have better communication and comprehension skills. I really realize how dull I made my bran by being a stoner, like constantly losing my train of thought, or having trouble recalling even simple words. I also make more time for people and experiences now, and don't feel awkward in social situations like I used to. For me, it's been fairly easy, \*most\* of the times. However, I do have health issues, including chronic pain, and there are times my brain tries to convince me that weed will make it all better, or that I can get some and be able to pace myself; to just use it as medically needed. But in the past, there have been so many instances of me trying to pace myself, and within a month or two, it leads to me being stoned pretty much all the time. It will always be one day at a time for me. There are still times I don't know if I can keep it going, and I have had a couple close calls. In the past, I have had longer quitting periods than this, and I have gone back. I can only hope I will remain smart enough to keep this up. I was a stoner for the better part of over 25 years. If you want it enough, you can do it, but it won't always be easy. Congrats to all those that have remained weed-free, and to anyone reading this that is giving it a new try. You can totally do it."

Weed and stress: weed allows you to escape all stress--including the type that would push you to grow.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2yyfn1/weed_and_stress_weed_allows_you_to_escape_all/,2015-03-14 01:50:13,"The thing that made me finally decide to quit smoking was how I realized it affected stress.

Weed lets you escape stress. Stressed about not being fit? Smoke weed, you'll forget about that right away. Bummed about having shitty friends? Or failing school? Not meeting deadlines? Stuck in a rut? Not sure where your life is headed?

Shit, just smoke a j. You'll feel better immediately. Now you can relax on the couch with some cheez its and netflix and enjoy your night. Return to the warmth of your comfort zone.

But what's the alternative? What if you can't--or decide not to--escape that stress?

The other night, I had the chance to smoke weed. I'd been dry for a week, and I've been trying to quit for good. I turned it down--barely. That night, if I'd smoked, I would have stayed up late enjoying myself, getting nothing done, and I'd have been tired for work the next day.

Instead, I didn't smoke. The stress about my own lack of mental balance finally pushed me to meditate before bed, and decide on the goals I wanted to achieve the next day. I woke up well-rested, and with clear intentions for the day. It was a great day. I was happy--and not in a temporary way. I felt proud of myself. By enduring the stress, I was pushed to do something that built towards true happiness.

A few days ago, an ex was telling me about her life. I'm envious of the social life she leads, to the point where it eats me up a little. If I'd smoked, I'd have numbed the pain, and achieved a temporary happiness. Instead, laying in bed after we talked, it burned at me until I finally threw off the covers, put on nice clothes, and went to a local club. I had a great time! If I'd smoked instead, I'd have missed that opportunity for growth. Again, ultimately, it was the stress that pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and grow.

Stress happens for a reason--it's the motivation for us to fix the things that bother us. A lot of growth is lost when you can artificially escape that stress, and weed lets you do that.

When you're thinking of breaking your dry spell, remember: you're postponing actual, long-term progress, in order to get a *feeling* of well-being. Every time you run away from the biggest stresses of your life, you move away from actually dealing with their causes.

**Stop running, stop smoking. Endure the down times, hit rock bottom. Rock bottom is a solid place to plant your feet, and start growing again, pushing up toward the light of whatever dreams inspire you.**"

"""Why aren't you smoking anymore?""",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/efsqpc/why_arent_you_smoking_anymore/,2019-12-26 10:56:02,"Day 139, but hung out with a bunch of people who smoke still over this Christmas week. Weed would casually come up in conversation and I would sometimes mention that I don't smoke anymore. The reactions were surprising. For one, I was always kind of known as a big stoner so it was an initial shock to some, but mostly the response was ""Why?"". I have a hard enough time articulating that answer to myself, so my answers were all over the place. 

But I mainly found it so odd that ""Why?"" was the immediate response. If I told someone I quit cigarettes, they wouldn't ask me why. They would say ""good for you"" or something similar. The rise in acceptance of weed by the general public, while an overall good thing (in my opinion), can lead to this arrogance that it can't be detrimental to smoke, and I have just recently realized how getting away from it for over four months has given me such a different perspective. Going into 2020 on my biggest streak since I started smoking in 2012, and I have no plans on looking back. 

The ""why"" will work itself out as I stop counting the days past and start looking towards the days ahead."

Recreational grower,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/i2mx9v/recreational_grower/,2020-08-03 04:17:46,I grow for a living recreationally in A legal state. I’ve been smoking weed since I was about 16 and I’m 24 now.  I’ve never had to buy weed because I’ve been growing since I was about 18 and I always thought I was the luckiest person in the world. For the last 6 years I’ve smoked from morning until night as much as I could handle everyday with no breaks. In that time i’ve made some of the biggest mistakes of my life cutting off everyone who ever cared about me. Every time something happened in my life that was difficult I would just get high as fuck and move on. I even fucked off in sports in high school as a top athlete getting suspended from at least 3 league football games every year since a sophomore. I was a dumb kid and smoking only made things worse as I got into my twenties. I finally decided I needed to take a break from smoking like four months ago and by the second day I was like holy shit this is great! By the 5th day I was having panic attacks that left my heart beating a million miles an hour for hours through out the day. It was pretty intense and scary but I quit cold turkey after years of unlimited dabs and bong rips so I knew it was just the withdrawals. Weird enough I never had any trouble sleeping at night but I had pretty bad anxiety and guilt trying to catch up on years of fuck ups and stupid decisions I made over the years. The worst part of the whole experience was acknowledging I’ve wasted so much time getting high all day and remembering the people I cared about the most being gone from my life for years now and knowing I’ll never get that time back. I’ve been sober since April 19th a day before the big celebration. So far I still feel like it’s the best decision I’ve ever made and I wish I would of started years sooner. I just wanted to feel like I did before I started getting high everyday and that feeling is slowly coming back. I still love my job and I have no desire to start smoking again. Being around dank stank all day doesn’t faze me I just feel like been there done that and I never wanna go back. Good luck to anyone trying to figure it out. The grass is absolutely greener on the other side.

It's also hard to be loving to someone that is always seems disappointed at you. Our problem seem to be so multi-layered and complicated.

Yes, I know we should seek counseling or get a divorce or schedule date nights or read self-help books together. We have done this, But ultimately revert back to our ways.

It seems like there is not enough time in the day to sort all of this out. I don't want a divorce but totally understand why most marriages fail.

I'm not looking sympathy or anything. I'm just venting some frustration.

After 31 little days I definitely still feel a lot of depression and sadness and despair... but I'm hopeful. Trying to practice self-love, but it's hard to when you don't feel loved at times.

Life is a trip.

I will not smoke weed today though and I hope you will join me. Have a great day everyone."

I almost relapsed after 300 days.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bd1k1t/i_almost_relapsed_after_300_days/,2019-04-14 14:43:39,"*Possible trigger warning as in this post I am discussing someone smoking in front of me.*

I have been feeling especially terrible lately. I’ve been wanting to numb myself way more. I call my sponsor a couple of days a week now and talk about wanting to relapse. It’s been really, really tough. I have a lot of fears about life that are eating me alive. 

I take it one day at a time, but I feel like my skin is on inside out. I’m so raw and everything hurts. 

Last night I went to a friend’s apartment. I’m not sure if I knew she’d be smoking or what. I’d like to say I didn’t know, but perhaps somewhere in my brain I hoped she would be. 

I saw her glass blunt filled with weed and asked about it. She started telling me about it and said, “you don’t smoke though, right?” I said not anymore. It’s been ten months. So we talk about it a bit more. She tells me about this deal she got, and I smell her weed. I kept smelling it, but I realized it probably looked weird, especially because I don’t smoke anymore, so I put it down. 

She lit up and I felt like time stopped. My senses were hyperaware. I haven’t seen anyone smoke in person in ten months. Or smell it in such close proximity. We continued to talk and as she hit it, she pointed to me and the blunt, asking if I wanted to. I said no, I wish, but I shouldn’t. She innocently asked why. I said I’ve worked so hard these past ten months on bettering myself, and I don’t want to be a pothead again. 

Time continued to stay still as I kept thinking about changing my mind and hitting it. Everything about the situation gave me this sick, sad feeling but also a sick curiosity. A sick amusement, even. 

Some days, I like to think I am better, but I am still sick. 

I left her apartment about a minute later because she was going out. I went home and called a friend and told all. 

Time started again, and I went to sleep.

It's been about 5 years now. Literally the whole time from 19 to 24 (now) is all a blur. I am at a point where I actually fear that I dont know what I will find if I let go of weed and face the world with my sober and focused mind.

Now I finally have found something that completely rocked me with goosebumps. A book by russel brand called recovery. Bring all my subconscious thoughts and feelings into the conscious has played a huge role in making me desire weed less. Over the past few days I have not felt like listening to music, watching movies and most importantly smoking weed. Whenever I have time to myself, I only feel good by opening up my subconscious and really talking to myself ""why are you doing this"" . ""You are so funny and smart but when you are high you are a useless stone, you dont enjoy it anymore but why do you still do it""

For the first time in my life, I see religion in a positive light. Nothing has ever given me more peace than to let go, stop trying to be in control and submitng to a power which will restore me to sanity. 

I want to be smart, I want to be fast. I dont want to wake up every morning with a foggy mind and no clear will to grow my career. "

This clarity is insane, I feel boundless rage, but its good. Rage is... substance, its energy. Anger shows me where i've came from and where im going. And this anger can be converted. I can workout and get fit. I can thrive and push myself.

Weed is great in the sense that it it stopped me seeing this rage, but never again can I afford to forget my anger, I need to accept who I am, and not hide from it. My anger doesnt define me, how I use it does.

And sure I got angry while stoned sometimes but that was foggy anger, undirected, bottled and simmering with no escape, route or cause. Its time for me to grow up and confront my issues."
"Happy 2020 everybody! If you're new here, welcome! Have a look at the sidebar rules and the notes about our community below, and then introduce yourself! We want to hear your story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eijytz/happy_2020_everybody_if_youre_new_here_welcome/,2020-01-01 19:14:11,"Hi, I'm Subduction, the founder and a moderator of /r/leaves.

First and foremost, it's great to have you here and I'm glad you decided to come to see what we're about. 

Since how we act towards each other is the only thing that makes this place as special as it is I just wanted to take an opportunity for some reminders for newcomers and old-timers alike.

**Who We Are**

This is a subreddit for people who have made the decision to quit cannabis, edibles, or other THC products.  The only people we're not suited for are people who have the intention to continue smoking or return to smoking.  

That includes moderation management, tolerance breaks, ""I just need to get away from it for a while,"" or ""I need help getting through the next few months while my dealer's on vacation.""

It's hard for people trying to quit for good to have discussions with people who are still smoking or intending to start again, so we keep our focus pretty narrow.

**Who We Are Not**

The thing that sets /r/leaves apart from most of the other subreddits is that people come here at what is often the worst time in their lives.  They feel bad and have little love for the world or anyone in it.

So one of the few rules we very firmly enforce is that we are a *support* community.  We are here to help each other, creating an accepting community and a welcome place to be.  I know the rest of reddit can be rough-and-tumble, but that ends at the /r/leaves front door.

Even if you disagree with someone, if you are rude, dismissive, or any other flavor of impatient we will moderate your posts or comments out, and if you make a habit of it we will ban you.  

If you cannot find a supportive way to communicate with people, find a way to disagree with them in a respectful way, or guide people with what you think are wrong ideas in a gentle and understanding way, then you should not comment.

**Dealing With Problems**

If someone is trolling, seems to have missed the point of the group, is soapboxing in a way contrary to our mission, or anything else that might tick you off, **do not comment, and use the report button.**  That brings it to the mods' attention where we can review it. Use the report button early and often, it's really a help.

Again, however, please don't comment.  That just gives trolls more opportunities to keep trolling.

To keep modding from being too crazy we use Automod keyword filters that automatically holds posts relating to some topics for review by the mods.  We review every single Automodded post, but sometimes we can mess up, so if you aren't seeing your post and think it's somehow stuck feel free to message the mods.

**How /r/leaves Works Best**

The point of /r/leaves is many helping one and one helping many.  I know it's tempting to be a lurker, but unless we share our experience then no one has any lessons to learn.

Please post often and comment often.  Just the process of writing out your posts helps you and posting them helps others.  

We now get over **100,000** unique users a month here at /r/leaves so even a small participation can help a whole lot of people.

Thanks very much for arriving here, and we look forward to seeing your progress posts and great stories ahead!

I haven’t been too hardcore of a user, but smoke enough to know that I have a problem. Using my long vacation seemed a good opportunity to quit. 

I always use weed as a little treat for small accomplishments, and so many times it’s been “hey, I’ve been clean for a few days, I should celebrate!”  and then the bad craziness starts again (sound familiar?)

Not having to be at work, this week especially has been a struggle, but this morning, the absurdity of celebrating a week clean by smoking weed just made me laugh, which I definitely can call progress.

The best way to start a new habit is to piggyback off an existing one. So, I have a little piece of paper next to my morning meds, and writing “Day 7” felt like a little treat in and of itself. Cheers"
7 years on weed now 13 days without,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cz373i/7_years_on_weed_now_13_days_without/,2019-09-03 14:48:09,"I’ve been smoking weed since I was 14 in Secondary school in Ireland. Grew up in a town with not much to do but either smoke weed or go to the pub. Pretty glad I chose to get addicted to weed rather than alcohol but now 7 years after I started smoking weed I’ve gone 13 days without it. I had been spending this summer smoking quite a lot of weed. My best friend who lives in my house while my parents are away small time sells to friends of ours. Great guy just not the greatest influence to have around. So with that came a lot of free weed. Smoking about 2,3 or 4 grams a night sometimes between 4 people. I always knew that it wasn’t really fun but never decided that I wanted to stop. Anyway about 3 weeks ago my grandfather passed away and I had to go to England to go to his funeral. I was going by ferry so I had to get a bus up to Dublin the night before the ferry. I was just finished work went home to pick up my luggage from home and when I went into my bedroom there were 3 of my friends in there, one of which was rolling a blunt. My best friend was in a different room weighing out bags. I had 20 minutes till my bus so I decided to smoke the blunt with them. Little did I know that would be that last bit of weed I’d smoke for a while. It was such a nice wholesome time smoking that blunt and a great way to leave smoking. I came back from England after 3 days of not smoking and my best friend offered me a joint the day I got back I don’t know why but I said no and honestly I think it’s the best decision I’ve ever made. I’ve only had cravings for a joint once and I was told by all of my friends that I wasn’t allowed to give in. I’ve become more awake and aware since stopping. Work has become more enjoyable as I’m not waking up with weed hangovers and going straight into work. And I’m motivated to go back to college and actually study and do work, which I didn’t do last year which left me in the sticky situation of having to repeat my second year. I really hope that I never relapse again because 7 years smoking was long enough for me to finish it there. Another thing I hope is for my friends to have a similar revelation. It’s sad to see but in my town you either get out or decay and the weed is really decaying my friends."
"15 year smoker, 4 CHS trips, 3 seizures, 3 ambulance rides, 3 cracked ribs, a fractured spine, 1 totaled car, one relapse & a brain tumor. I am done. Clean for 70+ days",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ce65t5/15_year_smoker_4_chs_trips_3_seizures_3_ambulance/,2019-07-17 05:28:25,"I've been a big follower and massive fan of Reddit since the website was created. This is my first post.

**Personal Background & Smoking Routine**: A 15-year daily bong smoker of mainly flowers @ 42 years old (male). About 1 ounce of the finest green every 2 weeks @ $280 per oz (not legal where I live). I'd add in a pen smoke-session here and there, but it was nothing like flowers. I would smoke all day, every day which turned into a form of addiction vs. enjoyment. I would clear a bowl which I called it ""personal pan bowls"". I didn't want bowl leftovers. Only green hits. Soon enough my friends were clearing a fat loaded bowl in one massive hit. It got to a point where that one personal pan bowl hit turned into a mere 15-minute buzz at best. Weed was a big part of my life from wake-n-bakes, cooking great meals, cleaning the house, hanging out with friends, listening to music, pool-time, grill-time, movie rentals, and of course browsing the internet. In my 4-bedroom house, I had a ""smoke out lounge room"" fully setup with an L-shaped couch, plush cushions, an electric fireplace for a chilling-out-mood-effect, and all the smoking gear you could think of. Glass bongs, Volcano, Papers, Pipes, Pens, Wax, Oils. All of it. I loved collecting ashtrays from around the world. It was the coziest room in the world surrounded by signed vinyl records from Michael Jackson, Cypress Hill, Steve Miller Band to Nirvana proudly hanging in full display. All autographed by respective band members. This room was specifically for smoking green. No tobacco was allowed but my guests were free to smoke as needed out by the pool. Across the smoke out-room was the workout-room. I smoked out, worked out, and I worked hard at my job putting in 40+ hours per week. I do not drink alcohol, or smoke cigarettes as I quit cigarettes 12 years ago @ 30. I've never been married, no kids (that I'm aware of), and a proud home owner with a dog, pool & hot tub. Nothing too fancy, but overall just happy. Life was moving along with work as I've been with the same company for 15+ years doing IT work making decent money since college.

After 15 years of smoking flowers daily, my body finally gave out on July 2018 on many levels. It literally shut down saying enough is enough.

**The First Body Shut Down:** On July 2018 I was driving my simple 2004 Nissan 350z (paid off), listening to tunes (Chemical Bros), on the way to work and minding my own business. As I was driving @ 11:00 am, my car veered off a steep hillside, went down the hill and crashed in a massive puddle full of water and mud. I had no recollection of how I passed out, how it happened, no ""feeling"" of the car going down the hill, or even crashing to a complete stop. I woke up to see both airbags deployed, the car destroyed, and I am covered in shattered glass from the windshield. I have always been proud of driving carefully, and I was in complete mind-shock thinking this has to be a dream. This couldn't be true. Foolishly, I tried to start the car, ""move it around"" in this mud-field and it was not happening. The car did not budge, would not start, and it was a 100% lost vehicle. Amazingly, no other drivers saw this incident happen as I was driving on the back roads (more scenic in Texas). As I come to my senses still dazed & confused, I call my girlfriend who told me to call 911 immediately. I called 911. I walked up the hill covered in mud, sitting on the road side curb, and 2 police officers come along with an ambulance. 2 lanes are then shutdown out of 3 when they see my car down the hill. They immediately put me on a stretcher and cut up my shirt down the middle, performing their medical checks. First question from the EMT, ""Sir have you been drinking?"". I said no, I don't drink. I asked for a bag and immediately threw up due to feeling so nauseous which made me wonder why. As I get a full examination with only a body x-ray and blood tests, I found out I suffered a cracked vertebrae, 3 cracked ribs, and no surgery was needed. Blood work was normal. Urine all negative except THC. I spent 1 full day in the hospital and they released me after ensuring my ribs and spine will heal on its own. The doctors said I was very lucky. Lucky enough for me to recover without physical therapy but to simply wear a back brace and take it easy. No heavy lifting. I was still wondering why I wasn't given root cause as to why this black-out occurred, but I was happy to be alive, so I let it go. I continued smoking away justifying this will help my ""pain"", recovery, and the doctors were fully aware of my smoking habits in terms of frequency. I had nothing to hide at that point and these doctors were okay with it. No medicinal lectures were given which was somewhat of a surprise, but I still wondered why I blacked out.

**The Seizures:** Fast forward 2 months later. I never experienced any seizures at all in my life, so I thought the first one was a one-off and would not happen again. I never figured out the root cause or future prevention. I worked out and I took care of my body in terms of diet. During July and August, I had 2 more seizures that came out of nowhere during my sleep and my gf finally woke me up. I had no idea what happened as she said I was non-responsive. Both events resulted in 911 calls with an ambulance ride. The weed smoking masked the seizures until my body and brain couldn't take it anymore. The doctors never put the common denominator together until I did. I researched this more in terms of seizures, marijuana, vomiting, showers and CHS. I was stunned to read all of it and how it all made sense. My girlfriend witnessed 2 out of 3 seizures at home and I was 100% non-responsive, I bit on my tongue so hard that a small portion of my tongue came out, and she immediately called 911. Again, I get back in the ambulance and they rushed me to the ER. This time, I get an MRI scan on my brain and more x-rays. As I was sitting there with my girlfriend, I am slowly coming to my senses. The doctor walks in with his assistant and he advised finally the root medicinal cause of all this. The reason I was having these seizures is because I had a benign brain tumor 6 inches long, smack dab in the center of my brain. This non-cancerous brain tumor had been growing since I was born. It was pressing against a cranial nerve (1 out of 12 brain nerves) which was causing me to black-out and have seizures. That is why my car went down a hill. Immediately it was all starting to make sense in terms of past issues of the wreck and overall health feeling. Now the tumor was at a growing point where it would put me down for good in terms of imminent death. I was told I cannot drive effective immediately, and if I do not take action to remove the brain tumor, I have 2 years left to live or become a full quadriplegic. One thing the doctor was very sure on was death within 2 years. I was stunned and in complete shock. He urged that I stop smoking and prepare for a 7-hour brain tumor surgery in September and get healthy ASAP. Basically, give my body a fair shot at going in the operation ""clean"" and allowing my brain to recover afterwards.

**The CHS:** Before discovering I had a brain tumor, I paid the smoking price with multiple CHS trips, 100% hot showers, laying on the shower floor, sitting in the outdoor hot tub on full blast, high heat, Caspian cream, IV fluids, loss of weight from 165 to 149 in a matter of 7 days and multiple hospital bills (that are still open). I could not hold anything down. The nurses asked me to stop making myself throw up as I had nothing to throw up in my stomach. During these trips, I had a sonogram done, endoscopy done, blood tests done and all tests came out negative other than THC. The doctor finally diagnosed me with CHS after I told him how much I smoked and my addiction to it. I gave him every pathetic reason on why I liked weed, and how great it is. The only response was that I needed to stop 100%.

**What is CHS?** It is Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome.

Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition that leads to repeated and severe bouts of vomiting. It is rare and only occurs in daily long-term users of marijuana.

Marijuana has several active substances. These include THC and related chemicals. These substances bind to molecules found in the brain. That causes the drug “high” and other effects that users feel.

Your digestive tract also has a number of molecules that bind to THC and related substances. So marijuana also affects the digestive tract. For example, the drug can change the time it takes the stomach to empty. It also affects the esophageal sphincter. That’s the tight band of muscle that opens and closes to let food from the esophagus into the stomach. Long-term marijuana use can change the way the as it often only happens in people who have regularly used marijuana for several years. Often CHS affects those who use the drug at least once a day

&#x200B;

**What does CHS do to your body?**

**There are 2 phases of CHS**

&#x200B;

1. **Prodromal phase.** During this phase, the main symptoms are often early morning nausea and belly (abdominal) pain. Some people also develop a fear of vomiting. Most people keep normal eating patterns during this time. Some people use more marijuana because they think it will help stop the nausea. This phase may last for months or years.
2. **Hyperemetic phase.** Symptoms during this time may include:

* Ongoing nausea
* Repeated episodes of vomiting
* Belly pain
* Decreased food intake and weight loss
* Symptoms of fluid loss (dehydration)

During this phase, vomiting is often intense and overwhelming. Many people take a lot of hot showers during the day. They find that doing so eases their nausea. (That may be because of how the hot temperature affects a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. This part of the brain effects both temperature regulation and vomiting.) People often first seek medical care during this phase.

&#x200B;

**Surgery Recovery / Post Op / Relapse / Post Smoking / CHS again**: After the tumor was removed in September, I stayed far away from smoking weed. I stayed sober for almost 90 days, and was on paid Medical Work Leave for 90 days - all paid. I used this time to recover and focus on my body. For some self-centered-weed-justification I gave in and took one puff on Christmas Day with a friend. One bong rip put me in orbit. Instant guilt was there for a moment (like some Reddit users mention), but I felt I had been through so much that I deserved a break and relax before getting back into the work scene in 2019. Life is too short etc. Unfortunately, that gradually turned into habitual full-blown smoking (like some Reddit users mention). January 2019, the smoking/lounge room was back in business with all the accessories to go with it. A brand new 2-foot glass on glass bong, with ice catcher and the finest ounce of green I could buy. All of it. I was happy to be alive and I wanted to celebrate. 4 months later in April 2019, CHS was back again in full vengeance. This time, no mercy from CHS. I was throwing up, hot showers laying on the floor, and the constant non-stop stomach-bile vomiting (literally yellow). I  still didn't learn my CHS lesson, and this 4th CHS visit was the hospitals final straw. Even with an IV for fluids, and all the anti-nausea medicine given, it was not working at all. I was still throwing up feeling like shit. This time the hospital was not so friendly from the nurses to the doctors after they saw how many times I had been in and my medical history. I was given many full lectures on the need to stop smoking weed. Not cut down, not take it easy, not occasionally, but to completely stop 100%. That was the only cure for my CHS. My girlfriend noticed how strict they were with me both in recovery and tone. She was silent and still by my side being supportive. At that point in May 2019, I was officially done with smoking weed as we left the hospital at 2 am and she drove. I was drained mentally, physically and financially. I promised myself and my girlfriend that I am done.

**Fast Forward May 2019 - The positives**.

1. Seizure free in 2019. Zero. No tumor regrowth per my last brain MRI. (One more spot check due in December)
2. I've been 70+ days clean since May 1st 2019.
3. I have more saved money in the bank account vs $400+ per month spent.
4. The house is even cleaner than before. Such as reorganizing the laundry room, food pantry, fridge organization, garage etc.
5. I read books a lot more.
6. Work Out harder. Lifting weights, push-ups, pull ups, sit ups, and running on the treadmill.  Starting @ 6 am daily.
7. I have a Fit Bit from my ""saved weed money"" that keeps me going. Trying to hit 10,000 steps per day.
8. I drink a lot of water.
9. Do I miss weed? Yes
10. Do I still think about weed? Absolutely.

12. My dreams are more vivid than ever before. I am getting more quality sleep which took about 30 days to ""adjust"". I did dream about smoking weed a couple of times and that was interesting, but glad it was all a dream. Lucid dreaming is becoming very interesting.
13. I meditate more, and I count my blessings in life daily.
14. I continuously read Reddit Leaves & Reddit CHS to keep me motivated to not smoke.
15. I am more aware of what I eat such as more vegetables, good protein etc.
16. All my smoking gear was given away. Free of charge. No misses. No regrets.
17. I plan to marry my gf of 3 years (known each other for 8+)
18. I plan on sticking to not smoking for quite a bit of time. (updated to **permanently**)
19. No CHS episodes, no vomiting, no ER trips.
20. I downloaded the “I Am Sober App” – it’s cool for what it’s worth. Thank you Reddit users who showed that.
21. I've always wanted a tattoo.  Now I have one on my skull. All-natural with a story.
22. I asked the neurosurgeon to take a picture inside my brain of the tumor, and when it's removed. Basically a before and after photo.  I needed to see it with my own eyes. He said he has never done that before. He surprised me and gave me two 8x10 high resolution color photos inside my  brain when I was recovering in the ICU. They are framed in the lounge room as a reminder.

23. I am more focused, I can remember things a bit easier and thoughts are more clear.

**The negatives (More like the misses)**

1. I miss weed.
2. I miss the smell of weed.
3. I miss the look and feel of weed. It is so beautiful.
4. TV / Internet / Cooking / Cleaning sober is fine, but I do miss it being blazed.
5. Getting quality sleep after quitting was hard the first 30 days.
6. Emotions were all over the place from being happy, to being depressed to final acceptance.

That's pretty much my experience with weed, CHS and overall personal health. Part of the challenge is mental belief that you can do it. And yes, you can.  Everyone is built differently in terms of their habits, their situation, their circumstances in life and their ""hand” dealt in life. I get it. Some of my friends still smoke since college and have never experienced CHS or tried quitting and that’s okay too.

Me? I was a classic example of addiction, with CHS, with health problems all bundled in one. Lucky me. Most importantly I am happy to be alive and weed free.

I just thought I would share my experience.

Be Safe.

The amount I get done in a day has massively increased.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/b99z0e/the_amount_i_get_done_in_a_day_has_massively/,2019-04-04 12:05:48,"Today I wrote down in the I AM SOBER app, while feeling frustrated with myself and stressed: ""Barely got anything done today. Hopefully tomorrow is better.""

But then I thought about it and I actually did a lot for one day. 

I got up early, ate a good breakfast, went to school early, looked at the clubs available to undergrads, read ahead in the library, went to classes, started my comp sci homework, reviewed after class, got a parking pass, exercised both dogs on a long run, worked out myself, got enrolled in Anthem Bluecross via University health insurance, scheduled optometrist for tomorrow, and did my taxes for 2018.

A few weeks ago my schedule was something more like sleep through morning classes, wake up at noon, not eat until I was stoned, and eat junk for brunch, go to afternoon classes, come home immediately, game, eat more junk, feel depressed, and sleep.

Amazing how that old life didn't feel stagnant because of being stoned, and that this day felt below average now that I'm sober."
Had an interesting conversation with my therapist about the affects of weed while in therapy.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9zwdbp/had_an_interesting_conversation_with_my_therapist/,2018-11-24 09:50:22,"She said in her professional experience, patients who chose to stop smoking marijuana made greater and faster progress than those who continued to smoke. 

A lot of people, my self included, smoke weed to help cope with problems day to day. But I feel it prevents the mind from solving more deep seeded issues. 

For example, when I was smoking I would never dream. Now that I haven’t smoked in a few weeks I’m dreaming almost every night. Most of my dreams are directly related to the reasons I’m in therapy. 
It’s like my brain is able to breathe and bring up it’s issues without being encumbered. 

It’s very exciting. 
I dunno, just something to think about y’all. "
"A welcome to our new visitors, and some notes on rules and moderation policies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5lgc5x/a_welcome_to_our_new_visitors_and_some_notes_on/,2017-01-01 21:24:14,"Hi, I'm the founder and a moderator of /r/leaves.

It's great to have you all here. Since how we act towards each other is the only thing that makes this place as special as it is I just wanted to take an opportunity for some reminders for newcomers and old-timers alike.

**Who We Are**

This is a subreddit for people intending to quit or trying to figure out whether they should.  The only people we're not suited for are people who have the intention to continue smoking or return to smoking.  

That includes moderation management, tolerance breaks, ""I just need to get away from it for a while,"" or ""I need help getting through the next few months where I can't get weed.""

It's hard for people trying to quit for good to have discussions with people who are still smoking or intending to start again, so we keep our focus pretty narrow.

**Who We Are Not**

The thing that sets /r/leaves apart from most of the other subreddits is that people come here at what is often the worst time in their lives.  They feel bad and have little love for the world or anyone in it.

So one of the few rules we very firmly enforce is that we are a *support* community.  We are here to help each other, creating an accepting community and a welcome place to be.  I know the rest of reddit can be rough-and-tumble, but that ends at the /r/leaves front door.

Even if you disagree with someone, if you are rude, dismissive, or any other flavor of impatient we will moderate your posts or comments out, and if you make a habit of it we will ban you.  

If you cannot find a supportive way to communicate with people, find a way to disagree with them in a respectful way, or guide people with potentially wrong ideas in a gentle and understanding way, then you should not post.

**Dealing With Problems**

If someone is trolling, seems to have missed the point of the group, is soapboxing in a way contrary to our mission, or anything else that might tick you off, **do not comment, and use the report button.**  That brings it to the mods' attention where we can review it. Use the report button early and often, it's really a help.

Again, however, please don't comment.  That just gives trolls more opportunities to keep trolling.

To combat spam, we have added an Automod rule that automatically holds posts from new accounts (less than 1 day old) for review by the mods.  If you aren't seeing your post and think it's somehow stuck feel free to message the mods.

**How /r/leaves Works Best**

The point of /r/leaves is many helping one and one helping the many.  I know it's tempting to be a lurker, but unless we share our experience then no one has any lessons to learn.

Please post often and comment often.  Just the process of writing out your posts helps you and posting them helps others.  

We now get 45,000 unique users a month here at /r/leaves so even a small participation can help a whole lot of people.

Thanks very much for arriving here, and we look forward to seeing your progress posts and great stories ahead.

The real reason weed is such a trap: offsets your short/long term balance,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hjlxsn/the_real_reason_weed_is_such_a_trap_offsets_your/,2020-07-02 03:39:10,"Smoking weed for some reason, at least for me, makes me value short term gratification more than long term. But this is not just when I smoke, it stays for a bit after the high as well. Smoking more and more keeps offsetting this balance until I am essentially living from moment to moment. Problem is: weed is short term gratification so its a complete positive feedback loop. It gives you this illusion that smoking weed gives you happiness but it is really just siphoning out long term for short term.

I have some more examples of how I become more and more short term seeking but just wanted to know: does anyone else feel this way?"

Disappointed,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eq60c5/disappointed/,2020-01-17 23:32:14,"When I was six I was diagnosed with tourette syndrome. A rather odd neurological disorder. When I was a teenager I discovered marijuana and that it actually curbed my tics, which is a huge deal. Fast forward 15 years of being a breakfast lunch and dinner smoker. I had to quit for a sleep study. It was hard, and the amount of emotions I experienced in that time were palpable. I planned on going back to smoking after the sleep study but then I noticed something.

My tics were only as bad as my stress, which is manageable on its own. Pots not necessary anymore. Unfortunately, I still enjoyed it. My first time smoking again after the sleep study I had a panic attack. Not good

Tried again later with smaller amounts, less anxiety but then I couldn't focus on other things I wanted to do, like playing the piano, writing and making art. It's awfully inconvenient.

I don't mean to romanticize my pot smoking, but I'm really bummed out cause it's like finding out you're in a toxic relationship. You have to end it. 

I'm glad I found this community
The stories help remind me that it's okay I'm quitting.

Feel like I'm going through stuff I should have done years ago. Smoking heavy through adolescence has left me with nothing but crippling anxiety and huge a capacity for daydreaming.,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bs048a/feel_like_im_going_through_stuff_i_should_have/,2019-05-23 11:47:18,"I smoked extensively for ten years. Started before uni, eventually dropped out but continued to blaze everyday. Eight of those ten years I was in a co-dependent relationship with a woman who took much care of me. I feel like the combination of daily blazing and a caring relationship very much eliminated my motivation to grow. I call this my extended childhood and weed was a major tool in this.

I can't really say I regret it all, because those were some really good years of my life. Though some part of me always knew it was just an illusion. But I certainly did no favors for myself by over extending the care free lifestyle. Now when both of these foundations of my previous lifestyle are gone, I find myself having to dig deep and go through a lot of stuff about myself and what I actually want to do with my life.

Everyone knew that I’d stopped but it didn’t stop the joints from being passed in my direction from time to time. It was hard to feel tested but empowering to stay true to my plan and decline each time. 

Tried my best not to be preachy, enjoy myself and challenge myself to unwind and enjoy the trip sober. It worked out really well, having a plan and sticking to it helped in the tough moments.

"Its all relative - removing one ""bad"" habit can have a domino effect in your life",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/b49oq1/its_all_relative_removing_one_bad_habit_can_have/,2019-03-23 00:00:15,"Its been 31 days. I'm clean. 

By abstaining from Cannabis consumption I have seen an incremental positive change begin to happen in many other aspects of my personal life .

&#x200B;

I was unemployed at the time I quit Cannabis, in the last 4 weeks I have interviewed for 4 Separate jobs and have been given job offers from all four of those jobs. 

&#x200B;

The lifting of the brain fog that people speak off has been incremental in me managing to have such successful interviews but its also because I'm not feeling lazy anymore from smoking so much so i've fallen back into my regular extensive exercise regime . Especially before interviews to get my brain firing at full capacity . which has paid dividend in my performance at these interviews. I can recall things better and vocalise myself with more clarity.

  
I've taken up meditation to help alleviate my symptoms of anxiety which I got from years of smoking which has helped me control my emotions much better therefore i'm not as prone to emotional outbursts and this has paid dividend in my personal relationships with family and friends. It also helped alleviate a lot of the stresses associated with interviewing .

&#x200B;

My lack of smoking means I have a lot more time and energy in my day now to exercise so I began running extensively, within 4 weeks I went from 5k runs to completing the half marathon distance (it was actually more than a half marathon 23.8k to be precise) which is quite a milestone for someone to achieve considering 4 weeks earlier I was sat at home from morning till evening smoking a minimum of 6 heavily packed cannabis tobacco spliffs.

&#x200B;

My lack of smoking made me want to stop masturbating daily as i've had issues with porn induced erectile dysfunction in the past. This may be a placebo effect however I did notice an increase in confidence when speaking to men and women alike, and also a boost in my physical performance on the runs or in the gym whilst lifting weights.

&#x200B;

My lack of smoking meant my diet improved so instead of devouring packets of potato chips and sugary sweet snacks I consumed strictly water and 3 balanced meals a day. within 4 Weeks I went from having a base layer of fat around my stomach and face to looking absolutely shredded because coupled with the extensive exercise regime the extra weight seemed to just fall right off , which was  a massive confidence boost as I look absolutely shredded now.

&#x200B;

My lack of smoking meant I had more time to focus on hobbies that made me happy such as photography so I picked up my camera again and coincidentally happened to have a friend reach out to me randomly around the same time for a street portrait shoot, so I took up the offer and used a website (fat Lama) to borrow a full frame DSLR to get some decent shots of my friend. The person I borrowed this camera off was a very attractive girl who seemed to take a liking to me.   
This girl reached out to me and asked if I wanted to work with her on a photography event which I agreed to . Yesterday me and this girl engaged in coitus . 

&#x200B;

In the space of 31 days i've seen such massive improvements happen in my life that it would be foolish of me to return to my previous way of being.

&#x200B;

I find it fascinating that all it took was me dropping my cannabis smoking habit for all these positive things to fruition. However a takeaway from this would be , that although quitting cannabis is the first step, the important thing is to re-engage in life by taking up other positive habits such as daily extensive exercise, meditation, hobbies, career development and slowly but surely life will begin to unfold itself. Quitting cannabis is the first step

&#x200B;

Excited to see where I will be in one years time . and 5 years. and 10 years.

&#x200B;

hope this can provide some perspective to some of you struggling, theres a whole life waiting for you out there guys.

4 months 20 days w/o weed - list of benefits so far,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/az8gf8/4_months_20_days_wo_weed_list_of_benefits_so_far/,2019-03-10 00:39:29,"Here are some things I've noticed since quitting, although they may not be totally attributable to smoking weed since I've also been doing a lot of other healthy things during this time like exercise, meditation, eating well, pushing my comfort zones, etc. (4 months, 20 days, 8 hours, 55 min =)

&#x200B;

\- a better relationship with my intelligence and memory. Now when things pop into my brain I can trust them and just accept things the first time when they come into my brain. I don't doubt things constantly, or re-read things I've just read multiple times. It's taken a few months and I assume there are many more months to go before my bond with my intellect is as strong as it was during high school and college (the times in life when I relied on it heavily and daily).

&#x200B;

\- an increased urge to get things done, productive things. Every day I check things off my essential to-do lists. Each day I add more. It's a constant cycle of doing a little bit every day, and finding the next thing to do in order to stay healthy, financially healthy, and overall in the best state of mind I can be. This is in contrast to my old, work then smoke the rest of the day, then rush to get everything else done on the weekends, kind of style to getting things done.

&#x200B;

\- less fears about people, less social anxiety. I'm not afraid to meet people and have conversations. I'm not afraid I'm going to stumble on my words and sound like an idiot. I'm confident that I can say what I want to say without being judged. Although I still do stumble on my words from time to time, so maybe more time is needed for my brain to recover from the years of drugs lol.

&#x200B;

\- Overall less anxiety and less depression. There are no more super lows or the general sense of ""mehh"" that I used to feel in the mornings. There aren't as many highs either which sucks but there is balance which is really enjoyable.

&#x200B;

\- more discipline and less cravings. It's easier to do what needs to be done becuase I don't have the urge or craving to sit around eating junk food, smoking weed, vaping, and playing video games. Now that I don't do those things anymore, my body sub-consciously recognizes that it needs to do other things in order to get serotonin/dopamine mood boosts. Those things are productive things like reading a good book, socializing with friends, facing a fear, or working/making money.

&#x200B;

BTW for the record, the highs from drugs are a fair bit stronger than ""lifes natural highs"", which is probably why we all love them. But from what I've heard, over time and if you stick to a healthy life with disicpline, then eventually lifes natural highs regain their strength.

&#x200B;

So yeah. Now that I don't get artificial dopamine and serotonin from weed, video games, junk food, and a lot of other negative haits; it's like my body has motivation to get those highs in other ways which is felt as a desire to work hard, push myself to new limits, and explore new places, people, and activities."
Smoking vs Not Smoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ap2drz/smoking_vs_not_smoking/,2019-02-10 12:07:07,"I just wanted to list out what my experiences have been while Smoking vs now that I have stopped. Feel free to skim through, and let me know if you relate to any of them!

- Money

While Smoking: In the past 9 years, I have spent an estimated $25,000 on marijuana and marijuana related expenses (rellos, food when I have the munchies, gas to go pick up, etc). That’s enough to pay off my car and credit card debt!

Not Smoking: I can actually get a grasp on my finances and have money in my savings. I look forward to spending $25 on paying off my debts or purchasing a new book or toy for my son vs easily spending it on an 8th that will last me 3 days. I don’t have the urge to buy food out or easily come up with an excuse as to why I should spend my last $30 on food and weed (usually the excuse is “fuck it”)


- Productivity

While Smoking: I thought that weed made me more focused. I would easily smoke before work or class and leave feeling pretty productive. In reality I was just numb to my laziness and the fact that I was actually just doing the bare minimum. I never realized how much time I spent laying in bed scrolling on my phone mindlessly. Days that I have off are spent running 1-2 errands, Smoking multiple blunts, and taking myself out to eat.

Not Smoking: I’ll spend hours at Panera laying out my finances for the year, or get ALL of errands done on my day off, easily. I read self-help books and invest my time in creating a better version of myself, vs wasting away who I am doing nothing. 


- Relationships

While Smoking: I honestly didn’t notice how much time I spent avoiding people, especially my family. My parents hate that I smoke so I constantly hide it from them. I’ll make an excuse to leave, then come home and use the side door to go directly up to my room. I even look forward to laying my son down in bed at night so that I can leave and smoke. Every. Single. One of my friends smoke and that’s almost all we have in common, besides history. I actually have avoided being friends with certain people because they don’t smoke, and hanging out with them didn’t seem very fun. 

Not Smoking: I make plans with real, genuine people. I hold real, genuine conversations without the thought of “I want to roll up right now” or “hurry up and stop talking so I can go smoke”. I focus on playing with my son and making his life better or making sure he’s happy. I will walk in the house and go sit down with my parents for 5-10 minutes just to talk about our day or how they’re feeling. I love more generously, because I’m focused on them more than getting high. When I am around my friends who smoke I enjoy seeing them act silly and being present in the situation.


- Dreams/Sleep

While Smoking: No matter what time I wake up, I will lay in bed for at least 25-45 minutes scrolling on my phone. I sometimes even feel hung over. How do I make myself feel better? Smoking again. 

Not Smoking: I have already noticed very vivid dreams and have made it a habit to record them every morning when I wake up. I love decoding them for what my unconscious might be telling me. I actually sleep a lot more now, because I used to smoke and stay awake for hours afterwards. So, my sleep has actually improved greatly. I have a regular sleep schedule and wake up feeling refreshed. 


- Control

This is the reason why I quit. I don’t like not having control over myself. My mind is constantly racing with “when am I going to smoke next?” “How much weed do I have left?” “Should I spend my last $25 on weed?” “Maybe ____ will smoke their weed with me” “I can’t wait to get off work so I can smoke” and so on. It’s always on my mind. It’s always what I want to do. I would never have turned down a blunt until recently. I love getting off work, driving home, and realizing I didn’t even think about rolling up or seeing if someone else will. I love having a mind focused on things that benefit me, rather than numb me.

You spend all your free time high as shit doing menial tasks like being couch locked watching netflix for hours, playing video games, laughing at shit thats not funny, staring into space, scoring. You no longer have meaningful hobbies or get productive things done because ud rather be stoned, so years go by with no progress. If youre a ""productive stoner"" you do the bare minimum to scrap by and as soon as ur done u get high. Anytime youre not high feels like a chore you have to get through until your high again.


When you quit, you suddenly realize how much TIME you have. The 6+ hours a day you spend high suddenly frees up and you have to FILL it with something like a *gasp* normal person! You feel like wow, wtf am i going to do with all this time, i just want to smoooooke. So in order to *not* give into cravings suddenly youre excersising, meditating, going out with non stoners for fun or to catch up, you pick back up your hobbies that had been collecting dust, you start studying/ planning for your future more, you start hanging with your family instead of ducking them, you suddenly have time to eat better *anything* to fill the time.

 At first it sucks, youd rather be high, ugh. Your body is over it. It wants the thc not this mess ur putting it thru. But suddenly after the fog lifts and u no longer feel like shit from the withdrawals you realize that this is how life is meant to be lived. You only have one you might as well spend it with people who actually care about you, who want to be around you for reasons other than getting baked, and to make yourself a better person doing things that put you ahead in life instead of passing away the time in a haze.


Actual id have to say worse thing about being a stoner is the brain fog. But maybe thats worse ""symptom"". Either way, that shit suuuuucked. The apathy, the lack of motivation, the forgetfulness, the inability to use my vast vocabulary because my brain blanks out at the most inconvienient times and I sound like an idiot when im fully capable. My goodness. I had to drag my ass to get anything not smoking related done. When the brain fog lifts and the world stares back at you with clarity, youll want to cry tears of joy. Then youll want to cry again because suddenly you can produce joy on your own without the help of a plant! 

Just some thoughts that keep me from picking up the joint again when im jonesing, from a former stoner. 

Please drop some of your ""worse things about being a stoner"" in the comments so I feel a little less alone =)"
After 25 days I relapsed. My thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hfrsc3/after_25_days_i_relapsed_my_thoughts/,2020-06-25 22:53:15,"It all started when I unintentionally bumped into an old friend when I was out for a walk with my dog.  I was 25 days sober at this point after 14-15 years of daily joints.  

We were talking and he pulled out a joint and I took one measly hit when he offered.  Huge mistake.

I’ll admit.  The feeling was good.  

3 days later my wife was out and I was home and bored.  I made the mistake of texting my dealer and 30 minutes later 5 grams arrives at my door.

I smoked it all in a few days.  It was bad.

But I realized how fucking stupid weed makes me.  The 25 days that I was abstaining from weed I noticed I was in a better mood and cognitively sharper than I’ve been in years....

This whole week my brain just wasn’t functioning well.  Everything was more difficult.  And after the 1st joint I wasn’t enjoying myself anymore.   This week was not productive as previous weeks and I felt bad.  

I reset the count back to 0.  

I regret I relapsed but at the same time I’m happy it reaffirmed why I’m quitting - I am terribly addicted to smoking and it only makes me stupider."
"Eight Months Clean, Here Are My Thoughts",https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/a7dp48/eight_months_clean_here_are_my_thoughts/,2018-12-18 21:25:24,"I made a post at my 100 day mark. If you'd like, you can read that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/91c5fn/100_day_update_the_3_most_important_things_ive/).

Now that I've reach eight months without any weed or alcohol, I figured I should jot some of my thoughts and feelings on the matter. Here are some of the things I've noticed:

**After a certain amount of time, the fact that you quit weed isn't a big deal.**

Stopping is a challenge at first. No doubt about it. When pot becomes a regular part of your life, and smoking becomes second nature, whether it be after work, before you go to bed, or before you watch a movie or play a video game, its absence is glaring when you decide to cut it out of your life completely.

After a while, it gets to a point that you aren't thinking about weed anymore. That's when the real growth begins. That's where you face yourself, your aspirations, your shortcomings, inadequacies, and weaknesses. That's where it gets difficult. That's where you either come through or fall back into your bad habits. The truth is that *most* people don't smoke weed that often, and if they do, they aren't abusing it to the extent many of us have. After a while, quitting weed is not this inspiring accomplishment that will keep you going. You have to find your internal drive that keeps you going, because quitting alone isn't enough.

**Pot can steal your identity.**

Not literally. It's not going to take your SSN and collect benefits, but if used in excess, it certainly can take the edge off of who you are. It certainly did for me. My intensity in my training, the passion I invest into my work, my professional and personal relationships...all of them took a hit when I was regularly smoking. I wanted to get out of all those things, giving the minimum ""passable"" effort that would allow me to go home guilt free, smoke, and spend time alone in my apartment. Since quitting, I've become more invested in my relationships, work, and personal goals. It's a lot more fulfilling than mentally tapping out with a bowl every night.

**Sobriety is underrated.**

There are so many things in the here and now that I am completely oblivious to. Getting stoned is taking the path of least resistance to merely get by. I don't want to merely get by. I want to be excellent. I want to constantly build on what makes me great, and work twice as hard on my weaknesses. I've begun embracing the idea of doing crap that I straight up don't want to do. Quitting pot was the first stepping stone. **I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.** I was happy going home, getting stoned, and being complacent, but I wasn't fulfilled. That short term happiness, and that transient escape is just that...short term and transient.

Sobriety has taught me that I have so much to expand on and find interest in in the here and now. So much so that I don't have time or even the faintest desire to smoke. Social interactions have become more fulfilling. I don't get nervous when new people come into my tight-knit group of friends. I don't overanalyze ridiculous crap like ""what do I usually do with my hands when I stand in a circle."" I am able to embrace who I am, and find comfort in the grind of improving on it every single day.

If you got this far, thanks for reading. I hope it helps you to read this as much as it helped me to articulate. I plan to make another post when I hit my year mark.

Feel free to DM me or ask questions here if you have any."
