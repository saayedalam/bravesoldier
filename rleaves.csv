"Some notes and encouragement on meditation from someone who has meditated for nearly 20 years. So I've seen some people expressing frustration with mediation here on /r/leaves -- in the words of /u/tommybahami123: 

>*""It’s kind of tough in the sense that I get distracted while attempting to clear my mind or everything.""*  

And from /u/jonny070389: 

>*""I’ve just given up on the meditation, my mind just goes off on crazy tangents.""*  

So as someone who has meditated for many years, and credits meditation with making my life an easier place to live, I thought I'd pass along my thinking on it.  (thanks to the Leavers above for the inspiration to write this.)

To me, saying *""I've given up on meditation because my mind goes off on crazy tangents""* is like saying *""I've given up on working out because my heart rate goes up and I start breathing hard.""*

Your mind going off on crazy tangents is exactly what you meditate to experience, and beginning to learn how to guide  those tangents back to peace is exactly what you're there to learn.  

*Everybody's* mind goes off on crazy tangents. That's why mediation is something you have to learn how to do, and why learning how to do it can take a long time.

My first suggestion is that you begin meditation with an attitude that it's something you are going to *experience,*, not something you are going to *do.*  Saying that it's something you are going to do makes it a job, or a chore, or a skill you feel you have to develop, and that's more than a little ambitious when you're just starting out.

My suggestion is that you sit quietly in a comfortable position, in a darkish but not pitch black room, and set a timer for ten minutes. 
 Tell yourself, ""That voice in my head is always yammering away at me -- for the next ten minutes I'm going to listen to it.""

Then, just sit quietly and listen to it.  Try not to guide it, try not to make mental notes on what it's saying, try not to tell yourself you'll have to remember that for later, just sit quietly and listen.

Then, when the alarm goes off, go on with your day.  If you can, try not to process what you heard -- don't think, ""wow, I really obsessed about work"" Just let that ten minute session go and move on with your day.

Do that for a week.

In your second week, you get to actively choose somthing to help yourself.  Set your timer, and choose something simple and repetitive to concentrate on.  Some people focus on their breathing -- the actual sensation of air moving through their nose or throat.  Other people count slowly and quietly to three or five in their head.  Choose what makes sense for you.  It should be peaceful and repetitive.

Then, in your ten minutes, let your thoughts rest on that repetitive idea.  *""<inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale>""* or *""<one...two...three...one...two...three...>""* whatever you chose. 
 You will, nearly immediately, lose control of that, and your chatty thoughts will intrude.  When that happens, simply think quietly -- ""those were other thoughts, I want to go back to my peaceful repetition."" And return to whatever you chose.

This losing of focus will happen ten or a hundred times during your session. Quietly guiding yourself back to your repetitive place is what you are there to teach yourself.  Don't get frustrated on how many times it happens, just note it, remark to yourself that it happened, and return you your peaceful repetition.

This is the only task and only work of meditation.  Noting when your thoughts have strayed and returning yourself to peaceful repetition.

I have been meditating for nearly 20 years now, and as you practice your inner thoughts intrude fewer and fewer times, and when they do you are very experienced at returning to a place of peace.

And, as you might suspect, the skills I've learned in meditating begin to extend outside of my meditation session.  I've learned how to be much more aware of my inner dialog, and I'm much more capable of noting what it is saying, separating myself from it, and keeping it from taking automatic influence over my thoughts and actions.

I hope this made sense.  Feel free to AMA if something wasn't clear.

"I quit THC cold turkey for 6 months - My Thoughts ""Weed isnt addictive, I can quit whenever I want.""

-A weed addict, who doesnt understand how addiction works. You'll never WANT to quit.

""Weed ain't never hurt nobody, I've held down a full time job at Walmart for the past 5 years and I'm paying my bills, how can you say weed is slowing me down?""

-A person who is completely content with where they are in life, and lacks any motivation or drive needed to move forward with any endeavors.

Every person, at some point in their life, will come to the realization.. that there is no growth in comfort.
How old you are when you reach that point, is completely up to you.

The thing stoners dont understand is, weed possesses absolutely ZERO short-term flaws. The damage it does to your life happens slowly over time.. and you'll be too high to notice it.

It doesnt ruin your reality, the real danger is how it makes you extremely comfortable in your current reality.

That's why alot of people up here reflect on how they stayed in the same place in life for years because of this habit.  

Weed is a coping method.
You had a bad day? Hit a blunt, you'll feel better.
Long day at work, at a job you hate? Hit a blunt, you'll forget all about it.
You're sober now, time to go back to work at the job you hate, take a pen with you.. you can be high all day and the day will float right by.


When you are sober, you have a fire within you that burns for better at all times. When you are high, you're numb, you're content.

When you're sober at that job you hate, you have the drive to strive for better. You have the drive to push for more out of life.

When you are a stoner, the only drive you'll have, is to make more money so that you can freely dive into the weed habit of your dreams.

I stayed in the same, mediocre spot for 4 years because of how content I was. One time I got a good job, and the hours prevented me from smoking and chilling like i wanted to, so therefore, I was constantly calling in sick so I could have that time to smoke and chill. 

This is why many successful people say weed is a luxury for those who have already made it to where they want to be in life.

Now I understand why, it's a drug that can keep you stagnant.

If you want to quit, my advice is to ask yourself, how bad do you want more? 
More out of life.
More from yourself.
This drug doesnt serve you, and it never will.
Right now.. you are a slave to your mind, and your mind is a slave to this habit.. that makes you mentally weak. Are you content with this? No? Then keep reading. 

All you have to do, is have the balls to acknowledge that you have a problem, and simply.. take back control.

Have the balls to take back control of your mind.

Have the balls to take back control of your body.

Have the balls to take back control of your time.

Have the balls to take back control of your LIFE.

No one can do this for you, only you can.
Realize shit like this is supposed to be tough, if this was a perfect world.. everyone would be free. 
But despite whatever cozy, comfort bubble your weed habit has put you in.. the world is not perfect, and this is not going to be easy.

Personal battles like this are what separates the mediocre from the great.


Just ask yourself, do you want to stay who you are for the next 5 years? 
Or do you want to strive for greatness? 

You decide."
"I used the money normally wasted on weed to adopt a puppy and buy her toys, supplies, and shots. Im so happy I quit. Look at her little face! Nothing but good things have come out of “leaving.” "
Finally able to afford a puppy now that I'm not spending all my money on weed! This is Ozzie and I love him! 
"My weed smoking buddy wanted to meet tonight and talk about life... One of my best friends who I've been smoking with on a near weekly basis for 8-9 years hit me up tonight to discuss recent drama in his life.

99% of the time we meet we smoke. Sometimes he brings sometimes I bring. But we almost always smoke. It's what began our friendship. 

He told me he has new rolling papers for me. The transparent ones that I like.  

I told him I stopped smoking 2 weeks ago in an effort to better myself but don't mind he smokes.

A second later he texts me saying he totally understands. 

We met. He smoked. He didn't offer. I didn’t ask for a puff. I am still 2 weeks sober. 

It was fine. 

We are still friends.

Even better friends than before"
"46 days clean, and I shot my bong to celebrate never going back! "
"Day 32, just wanted to share something that happened tonight what my life looked like for the past 5 years: rush home after work to get high. crash. get high. crash. get high. crash. get high. fall asleep. avoid my dad with dementia because its too painful. get high as soon as i crash so i don't cry about avoiding my ailing dad while he sits alone and confused. 

what my life looked like tonight: call my dad soon as i get off work. pick him up and take him to get frozen yogurt. help him navigate the place. crack jokes, get laughs. pay for his frozen yogurt while he holds it excitedly, like a little kid about to get a special treat. drive him home, sit with him and eat together watching his favorite tv show. 

didn't have to rush to get high, didn't have to emotionally avoid. so much more time, so much more emotional capacity and clarity.

dont get me wrong: sobriety is hard, like all the time, but worth it. "
"Quit Any Bad Habit INSTANTLY Without Willpower # Quit Any Bad Habit INSTANTLY Without Willpower

📷

**Quitting bad habits is EASY, you've just been using the wrong method!**

Normally people quit a habit using willpower, but willpower is a limited resource.

When we rely on willpower we encounter ego-depletion - We lose all motivation to keep fighting and give in to our raging craving.

For example:

When you first quit, you can do well for a few days...

Then you start to think *""Maybe just this one time""* or *""I've been good, I can just do it a little""*.

And you give in.

But don't worry, **THERE IS ANOTHER WAY:**

Using this strange method, I have quit alcohol, sugar, binge eating, smoking, porn and procrastination.

As a result I have lost 70 pounds, found a girlfriend, quit all medication and I wake up with a smile on my face.

Here is the method:

1. Meet your Addiction Voice (AV)

You bad habit or addiction has it's own voice, the AV.

The AV wants you to give in to your cravings, and works by hijacking your inner monologue.

It will say things in your own voice like *""Why don't you just smoke one more time, it won't do any harm!""* or *""You need to smoke, or you will get grumpy and damage your relationships.""*

The truth is:

**Everything the AV says is a lie to get you to give in to your bad habit.**

2) Learn to recognise your AV

Your AV can be brought to light by making The Law.

The Law is unbreakable, and doesn't require any willpower to follow.

Does it require willpower for you not to steal a car or rob a bank?

NO!

The Law cannot be broken at any point.

Write down your law if it helps, but the most important part is defining it.

E.g. ""I will never smoke again"".

But how can this help you recognise your AV?

**Because any thought that pops in your head that contradicts the law is the AV, not you.**

3) Create an AV Avatar

Assign an avatar to your AV.

For example, my smoking AV was an old, ugly man who chain smoked and had cancer.

Whenever I'd hear him say *""Go on, just have a quick one, it can't hurt!""* I'd say ""Screw you old man"" and give him the finger.

This also helps with cravings.

**Cravings aren't really happening to you, they are happening to your AV avatar.**

Your AV Avatar wants to give in, not you!

Without you giving in, they will disappear and die!

Your true self is already free of this addiction, so the cravings aren't happening to you, they are happening to your AV.

Extra tips:

* NEVER NEGOTIATE. If you keep playing with your AV and trying to argue, you will just end up giving in. AS SOON AS YOUR RECOGNISE YOUR AV, SHUT IT DOWN.
* Make your avatar ugly, not friendly. They are the scum of the earth. My binge avatar was a pig - not a cute little one, a fat smelly, warty one.
* Always remember, your AV cannot make you do anything. All it can do is speak to you, you don't have to do what it says!
* Your cravings and voice will disappear faster than you realise, but NEVER let your guard down.

Now go out there and kick your AV's ass and say goodbye to your bad habit!"
This used to be my smoke spot. Now it's my banana spot. 
"You should break up with weed if You love it so much that it's all that you think of right after waking up.

You have been getting high each and every day of your life, for many months or for many years.

Your whole life is centred around getting high.

You first get high even to do your mundane tasks.

Your life has narrowed down to enjoying only when you are smoked up.

You are always thinking about your next dose even after getting high.

You have tried moderation, but very soon, you are back to your old self.

You become irritable, bad-tempered and fearful when you are going to run out of your stock.

Your closest buddies are the ones who indulge in weed or other substances.

You only go out if there is weed involved.

You go to work but in the background, you are always looking for your evening or night with Mary Jane. Or you go to work after getting high. Or you manage to get high even in the middle of your work.

You clearly have come to the realization that weed is affecting all the possible domains of your life.( physical, mental, financial, spiritual, relationship with the loved ones/ the opposite sex, social skills, work and career, hobbies, passions, personality or character)

You have a feeling that you are living far below your true potential and calibre. ( Trust me, if you feel that, it's QUITE THE TRUTH!)

Your every day is kind of the same, like riding in a Ferris wheel.

You tend to think about sober life and all the better things you could be doing after getting high.

You have become tired of that specific, fleeting, only partially satisfying, very familiar type of high that only downregulates with time.

You mostly pass out in your bed after getting high and exhausted.

Edit: Thank you /u/hsquared9319 for the Gold. Thank you to /u/Hpa511 for one more additional point. Thank you to this brilliant community for allowing me to break free as I am 21 days sober today. Some more content on the way for all you amazing souls!"
"My wife threw it all out It was the end of the day. We had just put the kiddo to bed. Typically this is when we would head outside to light up, but I was 5 days into sobriety, so she was doing that alone. These early days have been tough because I know I could just go with her. 

My plan was to turn on the baseball game and dive into some code for a side project. Went to turn on the game and it was blacked out. I became unreasonably angry at this. I felt helpless, like I couldn't even distract myself from my cravings.

When my wife came back inside, I was ranting angrily about it. None of this anger was directed at her but my aura was not fun at that moment.

I went down to feed our pets, angrily grumbling to them. Came back upstairs, and I saw my wife going back outside. At first I thought I fucked up and needed to go out and apologize for being overly mad about something as stupid as a baseball game. 

I couldn't be more wrong. She came inside with what was left of our stash. Went straight to the bathroom and dumped it all in the toilet. 

""We're doing this together"" she said. 

I hugged her and cried into her shoulder. I know this decision is hard and I didn't want to make her give up her vice just because I had chosen to. I was so overwhelmed with love at that moment. She prioritized me, and that meant so much. 

Day 6 today for me. Day 1 for her. I feel so much stronger and confident with her at my side through this."
"Weed makes it OK 
-Weed makes it ok for you to go to bed without brushing your teeth. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to pig out on junk food (and not clean up the mess).

-Weed makes it ok for you to spend money you should be saving. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to live a passionless life. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to live in isolation. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to not clean your room. 

-Weed makes it ok for you to forget your goals.

-Weed makes it ok for you to turn your head away from the real source of pain. 

-Weed makes you think you’re OK. 

Chronic use of weed made these and many other detrimental behaviors seem OK. There was no problem, so long I had some flower to smoke. 

You have a choice, and even though it might seem scary, even though you might think “how am I going to live without weed?”, once you make a choice for yourself, a choice to be happy again, you will thank yourself later. 

Don’t give up, it’s much brighter on this side- I promise. 

** Remember- it’s not weed’s fault, but rather your own choices.


EDIT: Wow. Thank you so much for all your support everyone. It makes me very happy to know that this helps many of you out there. Keep on believing in yourselves, you are not alone. ❤️ Also, please remember this is from my personal experience, everyone is different. ❤️❤️ Much love, and stay happy."
A new type of 420 to celebrate ☻ 
"Thanks to r/trees and r/all we have a bunch of new members - hello! If you're new here, have a look below at what we're about. If you've been here awhile, please make a special effort to find posts without comments and give your thoughts so people know they're welcome! Hi, I'm Subduction, the founder and a moderator of /r/leaves.

First and foremost, it's great to have you here and I'm glad you decided to come to see what we're about. 

Since how we act towards each other is the only thing that makes this place as special as it is I just wanted to take an opportunity for some reminders for newcomers and old-timers alike.

**Who We Are**

This is a subreddit for people who have made the decision to quit cannabis, edibles, or other THC products.  The only people we're not suited for are people who have the intention to continue smoking or return to smoking.  

That includes moderation management, tolerance breaks, ""I just need to get away from it for a while,"" or ""I need help getting through the next few months while my dealer's on vacation.""

It's hard for people trying to quit for good to have discussions with people who are still smoking or intending to start again, so we keep our focus pretty narrow.

**Who We Are Not**

The thing that sets /r/leaves apart from most of the other subreddits is that people come here at what is often the worst time in their lives.  They feel bad and have little love for the world or anyone in it.

So one of the few rules we very firmly enforce is that we are a *support* community.  We are here to help each other, creating an accepting community and a welcome place to be.  I know the rest of reddit can be rough-and-tumble, but that ends at the /r/leaves front door.

Even if you disagree with someone, if you are rude, dismissive, or any other flavor of impatient we will moderate your posts or comments out, and if you make a habit of it we will ban you.  

If you cannot find a supportive way to communicate with people, find a way to disagree with them in a respectful way, or guide people with what you think are wrong ideas in a gentle and understanding way, then you should not comment.

**Dealing With Problems**

If someone is trolling, seems to have missed the point of the group, is soapboxing in a way contrary to our mission, or anything else that might tick you off, **do not comment, and use the report button.**  That brings it to the mods' attention where we can review it. Use the report button early and often, it's really a help.

Again, however, please don't comment.  That just gives trolls more opportunities to keep trolling.

To keep modding from being too crazy we use Automod keyword filters that automatically holds posts relating to some topics for review by the mods.  We review every single Automodded post, but sometimes we can mess up, so if you aren't seeing your post and think it's somehow stuck feel free to message the mods.

**How /r/leaves Works Best**

The point of /r/leaves is many helping one and one helping many.  I know it's tempting to be a lurker, but unless we share our experience then no one has any lessons to learn.

Please post often and comment often.  Just the process of writing out your posts helps you and posting them helps others.  

We now get over **145,000** unique users a month here at /r/leaves so even a small participation can help a whole lot of people.

Thanks very much for arriving here, and we look forward to seeing your progress posts and great stories ahead!

-- Subduction & The Mod Team"
"My wife told me last night that all she wants for her birthday this year is a sober husband........ My wife of 18 years told me last night, with tears in her beautiful eyes, that all she wants for her birthday this year is a sober husband. It was an ultimatum . . . a line in the sand of sorts.  This rattled me to my core and was just the impetus I needed to finally break this chain of addiction once-and-for-all. I’m 41 years old and I’ve been smoking weed off and on (mostly on) since I was 15. I quit drinking and smoking cigarettes many years ago. Marijuana, however, has proven to be my toughest chemical crutch to hang up for good. I’ve been trying to quit for 11 years now. I’ve quit for over a year on three separate occasions, only to  be lured back by this most seductive drug. Even though my parents encouraged me to drink and smoke from a very young age, I take full responsibility for my actions at this point in my life. Enough is enough. I’m determined to give my wife a completely sober, present husband. I’m determined to give my kids a completely sober, present dad — which is something I never had as a child. The cycle of addiction ends with me. I’m doing this for them, yes, but, first and foremost, at the end of the day, I’m doing this for myself. 

“I’m a healthy person. I don’t smoke weed anymore.” 

This is my new mantra. I chant it silently while I meditate. I chant it while doing Yoga. I chant it on my daily, early morning runs. I chant it before and during any activity that I used to associate with smoking weed. And, in doing so, I’m truly beginning to believe it. 

I’m determined, more than ever before, to finally nip this thing in the bud for good. 
Pun intended ;) 

This wonderful community of supportive folks has been absolutely invaluable to me. So glad to be a leaver instead of a stoner. ( Day 11 )
Big love, friends. ❤️

Edit: 
I am overwhelmed and humbled by the outpouring of wisdom, encouragement, and support from complete strangers on this sub. I have tears in my eyes as I write this because I am so deeply moved by all this genuine kindness. Thank all of you so very much! Based on some tips I’ve received here, I’m changing my mantra to, simply, “I’m a happy, healthy, sober person.” It makes sense that, psychologically speaking, saying, “I don’t smoke weed anymore” can have a negative connotation to it since it emphasizes something lost rather than something gained. I’m set to gain (and keep) soooooo much by sticking firmly to a path of sobriety and that’s exactly what I intend to do....what I WILL do!

Also, today I stopped by both of my stoner friends’ houses individually and made it very clear to them that I do not smoke weed anymore. I was completely honest with them about why, without being judgmental in any way towards their choice for continuing. This was a very big deal for me and something I’ve never been able to do before in the past. It’s a game changer. They were both extremely supportive of and encouraging to me. One of them, my longtime best friend, to my great surprise, even opened up to me and showed interest in also wanting to quit for some of the same reasons I mentioned. We plan on starting some healthy activities together from now on instead of just sitting around toking together as we have for years. I’m very proud of myself for the first time in awhile, and so is my wife. I came home from that and playfully flexed my arms and, with a big smile, said to my wife, “I’M STRONGER THAN A PLANT, BABE!!!” 😂 Again, thank you all so very much! I will check in here regularly.  😊🙏
    ~”A happy, healthy, sober person”~"
Sober since 11/9. Here's why. 
"For the past month I have been meditating daily, working out, stretching on a yoga mat for 20 minutes a night, drinking tea instead of coffee, and getting 8.5 hours of sleep per night and I feel like I have SUPERPOWERS! 
I have to admit I feel kind of fucking ridiculous as I type this. It's amazing what dropping my bad habits and replacing them with good habits has done for me. I used to smoke myself to sleep each night with high THC dabs and I would wake up feeling like a train had hit me in the head. I had to have a fucking bang every morning just to get out of bed and I only ate when I was stoned and it was always greasy fast food.

Fuck that noise I am never going back. I love this new lifestyle and I love feeling like a champion every day. No morning brain fog at all, I even wake up early. I'm even picking up old hobbies I stopped doing like reading and training my dog to learn new tricks. 

The biggest realization I've had is life doesn't always have to be so fucking hard. If you take care of yourself it makes every other problem in life SO much more manageable! I feel so much less stressed all the time and I have a much bigger attention span at work. It's like hitting the easy mode button on life. I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it."
"""I want to quit when I'm high but I want get high when I'm sober"" was so true for me because that's how *everything* was when I was high. Big life plans, things to learn, incredible inventions, screenplay ideas, that all evaporated when the high wore off. Weed is the ultimate empty yes man. Weed sat next to me for years, saying *""Wow, that's an awesome idea dude, write that down, now take another puff and we'll start tomorrow for sure.""*

Tomorrow never came until I quit."
My chess rating since I stopped smoking. It’s nice to see a clear indication that my cognitive functions are returning. 
"600 days clean, the best thing about marijuana is also the worst thing about marijuana I smoked every day, almost constantly for about 7 years. I could recite every canned talking point about the safety of the substance, how you “can’t get addicted to it”, all the negative effects that come from prohibition, and anything else you can imagine. One of my favorite facts is that there has never been one death from blood toxicity of cannabinoids. Other than stupid choices one makes while under the influence, you cannot effectively kill yourself by smoking too much weed. Trust me, I’ve tried. I still consider this to be one of the best attributes of the drug. It’s relatively safe in this respect.

However this fact also has a very dark side to it. You can smoke weed all day every day and still survive. If I had consumed any other substance with the frequency and quantity that I smoked weed, I’d be fucking dead. Full stop. I would be viewed as an addict, I would have profound health problems, and would be generally a degenerate by any reasonable persons’ standard. 

But because I smoked weed I wasn’t an addict, you can’t get addicted to it! I was a stoner. A nonconformist. I lived my life how I saw fit, otherwise I would just be a square. 

I could smoke relentlessly and have no incredibly negative consequences. And I’m the sort of person that needs consequences. I thought that because I didn’t flunk out of school, get arrested, or have any sort of major health problems that I was keeping it together. I was surviving.

But I wasn’t truly living.

Friends of mine graduated and began to do big things. Start business, go to graduate school, write books, get jobs and wives. I sat around watching The Office or Its Always Sunny for the fifth time. I never held a good job, just enough to pay for my weed. I lived at home with my parents. In short I stagnated. I never matured, I never developed positive coping skills, nor learned how to try, fail, and try again. I watched friends and schoolmates build lives and realize their potential. I didn’t truly realize this for years.

If I had had obvious consequences I would have had to face them. But I fell pray to weeds subtle seduction, and faced its cruelest trick. It doesn’t kill you, but it still takes your life. Don’t get me wrong, it’s definitely preferable to be alive than to die by an overdose. But it’s sadder in its own way to live in stagnation than to truly live.

It is the life unlived."
"If cannabis was a girl I wrote this for myself after getting pretty much 0 sleep the first night. It just hit me that my entire relationship with weed seriously resembled a relationship I had with an extremely needy girl.

**So here, If cannabis was a girl:**

When you first met her you couldn't believe how great she was. She made you forget your problems, food tasted better, sex was amazing and even if you were a lifelong insomniac with her you could relax and sleep for 10 hours. WOW. Unlike your ex, miss Alcohol she also just left in the morning. She gave you one more kiss of happiness and said: ""see you at the next party"".

Next few weekends were the same. She just kept on giving without asking for anything in return. You liked her so much that seeing her just once per week wasn't enough anymore. You decided to start seeing her every night. She remained more or less the same but you changed. You feel in love with her so much that you stopped doing your evening activities just to be with her. You dropped an odd friend or two and stopped your healthy diet so you two could enjoy the junk food she likes so much.

After few months, you started thinking that life without her just wouldn't be the same, so you decided to let her move in with you and spend entire days together.

**Now she started showing her true colors.**

She told you to drop more of your friends and family to make time for her and without even thinking, you did. She told you that you aren't allowed to eat food, fuck or sleep unless she is there. You started seeing that this is no longer free spirited, non needy girl you thought she was. 

You tried to take a break for a week just to realize how deep she got her hooks in you. She was right, you couldn't sleep,  eat, or even enjoy a movie without her.

But now you know her for what she really is. You also realize that it wasn't just her fault. You are a needy person that wanted her to be with you 24/7. You thought she was a solution to all your problems, she wasn't. She just made you forget about them. 
Now you have to deal with 20 things at once. 

Good news? Even just 24h after the last contact with her, you start quickly forgetting about her. Sure happy memories come back and tempt you every now and then, but now you know better.

While things are bad, you know that in a week they will be much better, and what's a week compared to a lifetime of wired co-dependent suffering with her? Nothing. I am happy to pay my price and move on. I am looking forward to another sleepless night, these will serve as reminders to stay away for a long time to come. 

Stay strong brothers and sisters, we got this!"
"After 8 days, sobriety really being tested. This is how I've chosen to deal with things instead - a sunset picnic for one! 💚 Stay strong out there, friends. "
"Don’t focus on taking weed out of your life, focus on adding more into your life and it’ll naturally happen Helpful advice from my mom."
"🌱 3 weeks clean, dealer refused my custom My dealer is an older gentleman, living on benefits and sells hash to help make ends meet. Whenever I pick up, I spend a an hour or so with him, ask him about health, fill out forms, move furniture etc. 

I went to see him today so I could drop off some food and pay some money I owed him. Muscle memory kicked in and I asked him to drop me £10 worth to help cheer me up during this self isolation. 

The man is a gem! He said you need to find a job and a wife, and look after your parents in this crisis. Told me he won't accept my custom and wants me to stay clean. 

I've been seeing him for 2 years. What a fucking comrade 🏅"
"The key to quitting weed easily and permanently Please hear me out and read till the end, this was an absolute game changer for me. The key to quitting easily and permanently really comes down to a shift in how you look at things. If you see quitting pot as this big sacrifice then your always going to have cravings and have to fight these cravings. You need to get to a place where you see quitting pot as a major blessing, see that your really not giving up or sacrificing anything, but instead gaining so much. Most importantly, you need to stop focusing on why you shouldn't smoke weed and start focusing on WHY you smoke weed in the first place, and dispel these illusions. What is it that keeps you coming back? What is it you think it's giving to you?

Most people say, I should quit because, my health will be better, I'll have better energy, I'll have more confidence, I'll be better socially, I'll excel more in my career, I'll be far more productive, I'll have better relationships with my family, I'll feel proud of who I am, I'll be more present in my daily activities, I'll feel more alive, I'll save more money, and I'll have more time to focus on the things that really matter. While all of this and more is true, these things do not address why you are using weed in the first place. Wouldn't it be easy to quit weed if you had no cravings to begin with? Your brain only has limited willpower so if your constantly getting bombarded with cravings because you think your giving up something you value, for any of these positive benefits, then it's a matter of time before you reach a weak moment and your cravings finally take you over and you go auto-pilot.

Therefore the key is to go through every single reason why you use weed and dispel the illusion of these reasons, I'm going to provide examples now of how this looked like for me.

The reasons I used weed and the reasons these were false illusions:

1. Weed makes me more creative: Actually this is not true. Weed disconnects me from my higher self. When I'm sober i'm alot more connected to the subconscious mind and find it easier to bring clarity to the ideas i'm getting from my deeper and more intelligent self. When I'm high I'm vibrating at a lower level, cutting me off from higher intelligence and not giving me the energy to bring my ideas into fruition. I am far more creative when I'm in a happy and relaxed state and when I'm smoking weed, because of the guilt I feel, I'm not as happy and relaxed as I could be, making my ideas and creative output lower in quality. Even the good ideas I do come up with, nothing ends up happening because I'm to stoned to take action on them. This leads to a sea of half baked (no pun intended) ideas that end up going no where. When I'm sober I have far more clarity and can hear music in my head in far more intricate detail and bring these ideas from my head and into materialization alot easier, this is why, the idea that it makes me more creative is entirely false and a complete illusion.

2. It makes me relaxed/is a good way to relax: Actually this is not true. It is robbing my relaxation and peace from me. This is because I know deep in my heart that smoking weed is making me move further and further away from my goals and what I truly want in life. Although it brings short term pleasure, it brings absolutely no peace and relaxation to know that I'm throwing my life and potential away every day I spend high sitting around. Infact, I don't think peace is even possible for me when I'm caught up in the daily smoking of pot. Not only that but every time I smoke I'm robbing my brain of the necessary chemicals needed to provide a natural and long term sense of peace and relaxation. I also find it impossible to eat healthy when I'm stoned, leading me to eating tons of foods that only contribute to anxiety and depression. Everyday that goes by that I waste I feel a nagging coming from my higher self telling me that this isn't the way I want to live, and that I want to quit. I'm not even dealing with the things I need to be dealing with on a daily basis, and am letting things pile up more and more and become more out of control. Because of this, smoking weed actually causes a ton of stress in my life and makes life 10x harder then it has to be. The idea that it brings me relaxation is a complete and utter illusion and nonsense caused by short term spikes of dopamine and in the long run causes tons of stress and anxiety.

3. It's enjoyable/gives me pleasure/is fun and enhances life: Actually this is not the case. It is actually robbing pleasure from me in every way I can imagine. First of all it's spiking my dopamine levels high in my brain, giving me short term, artificial pleasure that plummets when I come down off the drug, only needing more and more to feel any sort of pleasure or happiness. It's leading me to miss out everyday on major opportunities that are going to bring me long term pleasure from the feeling of winning and success in life. Every experience that I'm having in life while stoned, is one that i'm not even fully present for, or fully experiencing. I don't remember 80% of the stuff I'm even doing while I'm stoned. Although it feels fun in the moment, its something i'll look back on in a years time and just see as blank empty space with no memory of the time I wasted and threw away. Is this really pleasurable at all? Is it really pleasurable for me to keep on pushing back my goals and dreams and not feel satisfaction in myself? To not trust myself? To feel guilty everyday that I need a drug to feel any sort of joy or happiness? Of course not. It's a complete illusion that weed creates any kind of joy or pleasure in my life, it's actually stripping me of amazing life experiences where I'm fully present and can feel the amazing joy that comes from feeling naturally alive, healthy, and accomplishing great things in life. It robs me of any true fulfillment and will only leave me with regret, broken promises to myself, wasted time and lost opportunities. So no, this is not fun, this is not enjoyable, or pleasurable or any of the things that kept me using. These are all completely false.

I could go on but i'm sure you get the idea, you need to go through all the reasons personal to you and write out exactly why all those reasons that keep you using are false and a complete illusion. Once you do these properly and see that you actually have so much to gain by quitting weed, and nothing to lose, you will no longer have cravings, or at least much fewer then you would of had. You've now dispelled the illusions that made you think you were ""giving up"" something in your life of any real value. You can see through these cravings and know they are false. Now is when you decide that your done with weed, you will never take ""one toke"" ever again, and that it's something you will never touch again in your life. You must understand your an addict and even one toke WILL put you right back to where you started, there is no moderation for us in this sub, so don't fall for that nasty illusion.

For people going through withdrawal, be easy on yourself, give yourself time, give it a month before you even expect to feel any bit of positivity, and don't get discouraged if your not feeling great right away. Your brain receptors are going to take time, sometimes alot of time, depending on your abuse, to rewire themselves and create your neurotransmitters normally again. Ride it out.

Best wishes."
road to keeping clean & building my confidence - I’ve been using weed as a crutch for years now - smoking on an off for 10 years now and I’m starting to be more and more aware of times when I “need” to blaze. I realize how insecure I get when I smoke and how much I want change in my life. 
"A Day in the Life of an Addict. I recently broke my 2 week sober streak by celebrating with a joint after I passed my licensing exam. Here's a recap of my Saturday to demonstrate how quickly things revved up in the 24 hours following relapse. I'm wasting my life away while I'm on weed and I mean that in the most literal sense.

Saturday:10:00 A.M - Wake up and purchase a quarter oz despite telling myself that yesterday was a mistake and that it was just a slip-up. ""We were celebrating!"". Also had to buy papers and a lighter cause I threw mine out the last time I said I was 'quitting'.

10:30 A.M - Had my first joint with a cup of coffee down by the lake. Great start to a beautiful summer day. So far so good.

11:00 A.M - Starting to feel hungry, too lazy to make food. Smoke another joint instead.

12:30 P.M - Meet up with a friend that I hadn't seen in a few weeks (because I wasn't smoking) and we smoke 2 fattys together.

2:00 P.M - Holy shit, I still haven't eaten yet! My stomach is killing me. I finally grab a burger from McD's (cause i'm lazy, remember?)

2:30 P.M - Whew. That was a good meal, shall I smoke another one? I think I will.

4:00 P.M - At this point my room mate comes home (They know I'm not supposed to be smoking) so I purposely left the house to get high without them finding out. I shit you not, for the next 2 hours I sat in my car by myself,  getting high. THIS IS WHAT I DECIDED TO DO ON A HOT ASS SUMMER DAY.  I think I browsed reddit and listened to a couple podcasts too so atleast I have that going for me. 

6:30 P.M. - Room mate invites me out to a BBQ. I politely decline because I've been smoking non-stop since 10 in the morning and I'm not even sure I'm alive at this point. Room mate is curious as to why I'm so low energy today, I tell him ""I'm just burnt out, it's been a long week."" Instead I mindlessly played games on my phone for the next 3 hours. DID I MENTION HOW FRICKEN BEAUTIFUL IT IS OUTSIDE?

9:30 P.M - Oh shit, I haven't eaten since 2, lets munch on some Taco Bell. But lets smoke one first.

10:00 P.M - And after.

12:00 A.M - Open up my baggie to see that I only have a nug and some shake left at the bottom. At this point I realize that I smoked a quarter to myself (almost) in one day. I'm overcome by grief and regret, and swear that after this one last  joint, I'm done.

12:15 A.M  - Got high for the ""last time""

3:00 A.M - Browsing Leaves and trying to muster up the strength and willpower to leave this shit behind for good.

&#x200B;

As embarrassing as it is, days like this aren't all that uncommon for me. I prioritize weed over everything whenever I go on these little benders. I'm out here lying to people, starving myself, sitting in my car doing fuck all for extended periods of time just so I can get high.  I can't keep 'living' like this.

Day 0 again. Fuck me."
"Great quote that helps me stay sober Yesterday, an old friend posted a picture on Snapchat from one of the Humans of NY books, and the quote from the woman in the picture was so profound. 

“I wish I’d partied a little less. People always say ‘be true to yourself.’ But that’s misleading, because there are two selves. There’s your short term self, and there’s your long term self. And if you’re only true to your short term self, your long term self slowly decays.”

I immediately applied this to my quit journey. When I have cravings, I try to remember that my “short term self” wants to get high. But my “long term self” made a decision to quit. This has been so helpful to me not only with weed sobriety but also with alcohol sobriety (that journey started about five weeks before I quit pot). So, when the cravings hit, remember your long term self!

Edit: Can’t believe this post resonated with so many people! Thank you so much for the awards! This sub has had such a positive impact on my life and I want to thank everyone who has posted here before that gave me the support and inspiration I needed. So happy to think I’ve been able to give some of that back to you all. Stay strong everyone!"
I actually believed smoking weed was making me more enlightened and spiritual. What an idiot. Reading books on history and philosophy while sober is much more effective. 
I drew a comic about why i quit smoking weed (22 days clean) 
"😞when I'm high I want to quit, when I'm sober I want to smoke Just needed to put it out there. That's where I'm at. I'll be out of bud after today and I think its just best to hide all of it and work on me."
"If you quit smoking today, you can give yourself the gift of 6 months fog free on Christmas morning. "
"I’m probably at least twice your age... ...If not three times. And since I can’t be a shining example, let me at least share some hard won wisdom. 

Every time I’ve relapsed, I’ve ended up in the same place. Stuck. Trapped. Lots of ideas, very little action. Disconnected. Out of shape. Unemployed. Lonely.

So much struggle, every day. So much confusion, forgetfulness, exhaustion. The mess. The broken promises. The unreliability. The lost potential.

My brain is damaged, my vision is damaged (can’t see in the dark) my lungs are damaged, my retirement is nonexistent.

This could be your future. I hope it isn’t.

I’ve been crying a lot, lately, about what I missed out on, this life. But I’m gonna try again. I’ve been sober from alcohol for nine years, quit smoking cigarettes a couple months ago. Time to get clean again.

Very glad to have found y’all!

I have my first 24 hours. 🙂"
"Stopping Smoking Weed is Gonna make your life infinitely better and is nowhere near as hard as your stoner-mind will have you believe! Go for it! I found reading the posts here to be helpful when quitting smoking. I figured I’d share my experience in the hope that it might help others in their mission to ditch weed... 

For reference, I smoked for 4.5 years. Daily for the last 3 years. 55 days free as I write this. 

I’ll start with a chronology of what it’s like to quit so you know what you might experience, and later on in the post I’ll write some more about how to get yourself psyched up for quitting and into that “fuck this” mindset! 

Here’s how it went for me... 

Day 1) It feels a bit surreal. 8pm rolls round and your instinct is to seek out some weed and smoke. Resist!!! Do something else - ideally something that will tire you out physically. You might (prob will) have trouble sleeping tonight. But guess what? You’re solid and you aren’t gonna bitch out and cave are you? No!!! Good. Your body and mind are used to being in a chemical slumber when you fall asleep. Tonight your mind is drug free and it feels like your thoughts are going 100mph! Don’t worry, it gets much easier. 

Day 7) You’ve been having crazy dreams because your body is re adjusting to having proper, healthy REM sleep. Your mental and physical ability to regenerate and repair is already much better. You’ll feel much sharper mentally. Because you’ve been smoking weed chronically, you begin to realise how much it’s been holding you back and feel like you’re the fucking guy off limitless, working at 120% capacity hahaha

Week 3) Up until this point, you’ve been painfully aware of the fact that days feel like they’re 40 hours long. You’re coming to the realisation that normal people (aka non weed addicts) actually do stuff like sit and watch TV on their own, go to the gym and then go to bed. Up until this point, you’ve been looking at the calendar daily wondering why only 1 day is passing when each day feels like 3. 

At this stage, you are realising with a crazy sense of “wtaf” how insane the concept of smoking weed every single day is in a cult of weed smokers. You realise how strange your defending of weed and weed smokers must have sounded to non-stoners. 

Week 4) At this stage, you are elite non-weed smoker and are basically out of the woods. You stop doing the weird calendar-watching and stop caring about how long you haven’t smoked in. You have absolutely no desire to smoke weed anymore. You might find yourself around people smoking weed again at this stage but have the ability to say no. It feels great. 

Week 7) You now realise that by not smoking weed, you have lots of spare time. You are much more efficient and motivated to do small jobs and engage in productive activities such as working out and attending clubs etc. You also realise you are about £100 better off every single week which is the equivalent of getting a 5 grand pay rise at work... tell me that isn’t a good incentive eh!?

Here’s the secret: 

The difficult part of quitting is getting yourself to a place (mentally) where you are 100% ready to leave weed behind and move on with your life. 
The whole NOT smoking the weed bit is actually surprisingly easy!

For me, the hardest part was psyching myself up for D-day where I was gonna quit cold turkey. It seems like the scariest idea at the time but once you do it, you’ll realise how little you actually had to worry about! Go for it!

Once you are in the frame of mind where you’re ready to leave it behind... you are in the drivers seat and in total control of your weed-smoking behaviours! 

Conversely, short term, ‘knee-jerk’ attempts to quit are destined to be exactly that - short lived and doomed to fail. 
These can be disheartening, however, like cig smokers and any other form of addict, it often takes a number of failed attempts before a successful attempt is made. If this is you right now... persevere! 

You need to understand that YOU and ONLY YOU can stop smoking. Nobody else is gonna do it for you. 

I used a bit of a self-hatred and asshole approach to help me quit. 
Every time I thought about giving in and smoking, I’d tell myself off. Am I really so weak that I will give in? I’m not addicted to heroin I’m trying to stop smoking a non-physically addictive drug here. Be realistic about what it is I’m trying to achieve. 
Think of the insane feats human beings can achieve under crazy stress and shitty circumstances. I have no excuses if I’m to bitch out at this. 

My close friends at the time (who are also heavy weed smokers) continued to smoke. I forced myself to completely avoid them and the weed-smoking environment because I knew it would be much easier if it was out of sight & out of mind. 
To them, I seemed like a dick on my tee-total high horse completely avoiding them. They would send me messages and photos smoking and try to encourage me to join them once more. I got the “cold shoulder” a bit as though id decided to turn my back on the cult. As much as part of me wanted to cave and re-join the safe, familiar environment - I resisted. The saying “misery loves company” is extremely relevant here. Me and my friends were validating each-other in our unhealthy weed smoking habits. 

I turned this negative into a positive.   
While they approached my abstinence with a “haha bet you really wish you were smoking weed like us right now” attitude, I would tell myself that I AM better than them with each passing day I didn’t smoke. 

I wanted to think: 
 “I’m missing out because I’m not smoking with them” 

but the reality is: 

“they are missing out because they are continuing to smoke” 

They were too weak to have the bottle to give it up. I wasn’t. This sense of strength and accomplishment felt great and encouraged me massively to keep going. 

The sad thing is, they didn’t want me to smoke with them because they missed my company, it was more about validating their bad habits. If we all did it together it wasn’t quite as bad! 
I’m happy to say that since then, one of my friends has since had a very similar epiphany much like mine and also packed in the smoking. This I’m very glad of. He said my decision to stop made him look at his own habits and realise how unhealthy they were impacting his life in his own unique way different to mine. I don’t have any resentment towards them as their behaviour was just a projection of their insecurity and desperation to be validated in their weed smoking. We’re still friends and I just don’t smoke if I’m around the ones who do now. 

Now for an overall thought... forgive me if this is a bit deep. This is just my perception and way of rationalising my decision to stop. 

I’m a strong believer that life is what you make of it. Every one of us has the choice to smoke weed or not to smoke weed. Ask yourself what kind of people smoke weed habitually? Is that the person I want to be? In my case, the answer is no. 

Is it making my life better or worse as a whole? Objectively ask yourself. 

We know that poor and disaffected people tend to have these kinds of destructive habits and ultimately they’re doing them to escape something. Whether this is poverty, a shit job, shit social support system or whatever, that’s the general consensus. It’s the same for hard drug users and the majority of alcoholics. How many successful happy people with beautiful wives and holiday homes in the alps sit in the dark and smoke weed for 6 hours a night? Virtually none. Ask yourself why...

The sad truth is that the most vulnerable people who do these things find it the hardest to break this cycle, but by stopping the destructive habits and investing time and energy into fixing the broken parts of your life - you have a much higher chance of being happier than if you continue down your dark spiral of substance misuse and self loathing! 

If you’re constantly hard-up and/or unhappy with the way your social life is (much like I was/am to an extent), smoking weed all the time is like shooting yourself in the foot- big time. 
Successful, healthy women (if you’re a guy) are uninterested in you because you’re a sad stoner in their eyes, no matter what way you perceive yourself. If you keep it a secret like I did, then you’re leading a fkn double life and it’s like having a secret mistress who you have to make time for on the side hahaha.
If you’re poor, spending your last £100 on weed and cigs seems like a reasonable idea. Multiple small releases of dopamine in a sad reality beats sitting at home bored with nothing to do. My advice is to reinvest your time and cash other places and the rest will slowly begin to fall into place. 

The rich non weed smoker with his holiday home and white picket fence house may well be in that position because he is much more lucky and privileged than you or I. By smoking weed chronically, we widen the gap between him and us. By stopping our destructive habits and reinvesting our time and energy other places, we can (to some degree) level the playing field and also have happy, productive lives.

I stopped smoking weed and spent the spare money on a gym membership and starting climbing. By doing this, I’ve automatically given myself a massive personal identity change. I’m now the gym goer and climber, not the sad weed smoker who has nothing going for him! 

Sorry if this is a bit long winded. There are other things I wanted to add but didn’t want to ramble (any more than I already have). The last part is my perception of reality and might not align with how you lot see constant weed use. That’s totally fine. Some people can use it in moderation and others still stand by it and defend it to the death. I’d say to them... try taking two weeks off and see if you still feel the same about your habits. 

You’ve got this in the bag. You are much stronger than you give yourself credit for. It’s a mental battle and you can win it with a bit of self efficacy and determination- go for it!!!"
Instead of smoking I painted this instead. The plant in the middle represents weed. 
"What have you accomplished since you quit smoking? I stopped a week ago (been in and out for a while) and here is what I've gotten done in that week:
- finished 3 sections of studying material for the actuarial exams
- cleaned the fuck out of my room
- had dinner with my family twice
- spent time hanging out with my little brother who still lives at home
- went to the gym 5 times, 2-3 1/2 hour sessions each time
- wrote up a schedule for the next week
- worked full time while doing all these things
- haven't eaten any junk food (interesting how that becomes so much less of an issue when I don't smoke)
- hung out with a coworker who's girlfriend recently broke up with him and he has been a little lonely recently

Having off today helped me get through a lot of that studying, but apart from that these are things I would have probably avoided or half-assed had I been smoking.  I made it my new goal to not smoke this month of July (taking an exam in August) and my brother just said ""Why not just wait until after the exam?""

Then I thought to myself ""Why not wait until I'm satisfied with where my life is?""  So new goal, no more smoking until retirement ;)

Jokes aside, I feel amazing right now and I'm going to continue writing down what I've gotten done and what I plan to get done in the future, leaving no time nor desire to smoke.

So, fellow members of /r/leaves, what have you accomplished since you quit? And what do you plan to accomplish?

Side note: this subreddit has been such an inspiration to me, the support you guys give each other and have given me in the past is very humbling, and I wish you guys nothing but the best on your journey."
"It just occurred to me today that you dont need drugs to be happy. There is someone there buried within you itching to come back out and that is the old you. Dont forget about him/her again, stay strong and they will come back even if you think you've lost em for forever. "
"I did it. I went to Costco sober. I’m a housewife in my mid 30s. Up until yesterday morning I was spending my days visiting parks or doing crafts with my toddlers. As soon as they went to bed at 7pm I would smoke like a chimney. On weekends I would eat edibles and do family stuff while stoned out of my mind. Once a week I would get stupid high and spend like $600 at Costco because being high made shopping so fun. I don’t think I’ve gone grocery shopping sober in over 3 years. It was my “mommy time” after a long day with the kids. 

Yesterday I went sober. I stuck to my grocery list. It wasn’t... awful. I think that’s a good start."
"Why marijuana addiction can be so hard to let go of I'm 1 month sober now, kinda missing pot but also slowly and surely learning how to enjoy things the same way when sober. Here are some midnight thoughts on why marijuana addiction can be so difficult to accept and even harder to let go of :

-When it comes to other drugs and alcohol, the altered state we're in is quite distinguishable. More often than not, you're not in control of your actions, but at some level, you are still aware of them. With marijuana, on the other hand, that altered state starts becoming your **reality.** Most of us smoke multiple times in a day, making the addiction more ingrained in our sense of self.

-This is where it all messes up. Our sober, normal self becomes our *altered self.* Why would you want to do something sober when you can be high and flow with it instead? For example, you want to have pizza but ofcourse you won't have it sober because it's so much better when you're high. 

-The main problem : your personality. I read somewhere that one of the hidden dangers of heavy marijuana use is the **paralysis of personality development.** A big reason I fell in love with marijuana is because of how creative it made me, how much more I could enjoy my hobbies, etc. So I started using it regularly before writing or painting. Again, that's where it all messed up. It went like - more pot = more art, no pot = no art, and slowly just pot and no art. I used to see this as a writer's block before I finally realised.

-We don't realise how covertly marijuana takes over our hobbies, traits and overall personality. We end up never finding who we really are, because we equate ourselves with the intoxicating effects of pot or with the withdrawal symptoms of it. 

-Although I do see how other drugs also block personality development, but the reason this one is so much more difficult to accept is because we never really see it as a problem. We don't see it as an escape from reality, we see it as reality itself. 

Do you all agree? Tell me about your POV on this :)


Edit : So happy to read your comments and be of help. Not all of this stuff is just introspection, I guess it just came to me after reading alot of blogs and talking to people. I wish all of you so much recovery and rediscovering yourselves through it <3

I've shared a bit of my journey [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gs4a1e/a_different_approach_to_recovery/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) . I hope it's helpful!"
"We normally don't allow outside media, but there's been a lot of call for this today. Don't just cope with thoughts of suicide. They a serious medical symptom and a reason to take action. Google a suicide hotline for your country and call, or take yourself to the emergency room and get help. "
Decided to write out what it feels like for me to relapse & put it in the same place as my stash. So far it’s kept me strong. 
haven’t smoked for a week can i get a hell yea 
"I Used to Think I Knew Some Amazing Secret and Everyone Who Didn’t Smoke Was Missing Out… Turns Out They Knew the Secret All Along  **I hit 5 months sober today.**

Got back from a 4 night holiday with my parents yesterday. When I was getting high all the time I couldn’t stand being around them and they probably felt the same about me… I also wouldn’t have gone if I knew I couldn’t smoke every night while there.

I’ve lost 50 pounds, painted both of the bathrooms in parents house, read 7 books, made new friends, started new hobbies, been in therapy since quitting and been able to take new important steps with my business.

I feel a new sense of clarity in my day to day life and have taken the power back into my hands in many ways.

I used to sit on my stoned high horse and look down on the world thinking I knew best. I never wanted to admit my faults, the main one being smoking hash and weed all the time.

I was wrong. **Everyone else was right.**

Well done to everyone else staying strong and thank you to everyone who shows support here, it really helps :)"
A buddy messaged me saying he has weed. I messaged him back saying ty for the offer but I quit 26 days ago. Looking back I would be lying if I said I didn't want it but I'm proud of myself. Every temptation I beat makes me stronger I guess. 
"Day 5- all of a sudden I really needed to smoke, so I ran 9k instead 🙏🏼🙏🏼 "
Hit my 6 month mark yesterday and celebrated it with a great climb with great friends. 
"Weed makes you introspective, which is good (until it isn't). When I was depressed, weed was a teacher I could not have succeeded without. It helps you see beneath the surface of life, and insofar as that helps you, weed is good.

Now I've seen beneath the surface enough, and I'm struggling to actually live a life in the physical world. Diving deeper is just getting me further from our shared reality. I'm no longer ""learning"", so much as I am imagining things and believing them for a little while until I sober up and life continues. 

There is no long-lasting impact to the things I imagine and believe while high nowadays, so whereas once weed was a helper, I think now it's just a distraction. I just like the feeling of things ""making sense"" for a little while.

Weed showed me a world with colour and feeling to it. For this I'm eternally grateful, and maybe one day I will need its help again. For now though, I think it's time for me to put the herb down and make reality home again.

&#x200B;

There's no shame in having had a habit as there's a time and place for everything in life, even weed. Our struggle is to recognise when the time for it has passed and to have faith that something new will come to fill that dank green hole in our hearts that MJ used to fill. Good luck and God bless all. 🙏"
"My dog died because I was high About a month ago, I was leaving my friends house, and I had just took a dab. I had my dog with me, and for some reason I just didn't think to grab his leash when we walked out the door. 9/10 times he would have just walked right to my car. Well this was that 10%. He saw a rabbit, chased it into the road, and was hit by a car. Literally the only car around came at that exact moment. It feels like the universe punishing me for being careless. I feel terrible. That night was the worst night of my life.

 People tell me not to blame myself but I know that he'd be alive right now if I had just been more careful. I can't say for sure that if I was sober I would have grabbed his leash, but I probably would have. I loved him so much and my girlfriend loved him even more, and now she'll never see him again. I fucked up- It was my responsibility to protect him and I didn't even do the most basic thing of keeping him on the leash.

I've been a daily smoker for years, but for two weeks after that I didn't smoke weed at all. But I slowly started again. I feel like smoking helped bring out some emotions that I wanted to repress, which was good, I think. 

I feel like this was a sign and a terrible lesson that I need to get my shit together. But I still have cravings. Smoking weed was how I relaxed. I used to love getting high then playing with him or taking him on a walk. 

 It's Friday afternoon and I just wanna get high. But I know I shouldn't. There's so much I want to accomplish and weed just slows me down.


Idk what the point of this post is. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading

I’m sick of it and I’m done. Happy new year to all! 👍 
"Replacing pot with cheeseburgers What if everyday you couldn't wait to get home to eat cheeseburgers?  While you were at work, you thought about the cheeseburger you couldn't wait to eat later.  You ate cheeseburgers while you did mundane tasks/chores to make them more enjoyable, but that just prolonged the task bc you were also eating a cheeseburger.  When you went to watch a sunset or to the park, you thought cheeseburgers would make this so much better, so you brought one along.  Starting up a movie? let me prepare my cheeseburger real quick so we can have it while we watch.  You shared your cheeseburgers with others, ""Hey want some?"" Many times you had a cheeseburger before bed too bc you thought it helps you sleep.  You snuck away from family/friends at parties to have your cheeseburger.  You avoided and missed opportunities to meet up with family/friends because you were too busy eating cheeseburgers. You spent hundreds of dollars per month on cheeseburgers.  You worried about not having enough cheeseburgers for later when you got low.  You felt kinda sick after eating them all the time, but you also felt scared about your life without cheeseburgers.

Nothing against cheeseburgers but I think it's pretty fair to say that consuming cheeseburgers in this way would be unhealthy...

You catch my drift."
"I’ve smoked and consumed weed daily (around 100mg/day) since I stopped smoking meth 1.5 years ago. I am incredibly scared to deal with myself, but I realize that this is what I must do to accomplish my dreams and to learn how to form meaningful relationships with other people. Two days sober. Thank you all for you support and your kind words of encouragement. I’m hanging in there."
"Sober me wants to me high and high me wants to be sober It's just like a switch, but I've realised that when im running out or i know i won't have enough to smoke as i want too i start to get panic attacks to get more as running out is basically hell on earth or that's what my mind convinces me of and makes me feel like. 

Then the absolute second i light up a spliff and i know i have enough to chain smoke a joint every 30 minutes that evening i want nothing more than to be free of weed. So ill try and smoke what i have as fast as possible so i can try to be sober. 

Then i begin to run low and panic starts i need more, need more, it becomes priority #1 to get more and get high. And then i smoke and i feel the familiar feeling of regret and wishing i didn't have to be high and wishing for sobriety. But when im sober i always cave, as i get like 10 hours in and say fuck this ill smoke forever as it's not worth 2 weeks or 2 months of hell. 

And then i wanna get sober as soon as i get more. :(

Edit - I fucked the title up. Also i Fucking did it again and bought more not even 4 hours after making this post. I literally just can't seem to even get to 0 amount anymore :("
"I was in 3rd grade, 9 years old, the first time my dad handed me a lit joint. I’ll be 41 years old next month.
I was in 3rd grade, 9 years old, the first time my dad (who was drunk as usual) handed me a lit joint. I breathed that hot smoke deeply into my young sensitive lungs as I’d seen him do many times. I immediately fell into a severe coughing fit. My dad laughed as if it were the funniest thing he’d ever seen. I remember distinctly feeling ashamed and thinking that one day I’d be a real man like him and be able to hold in that hot smoke. Thus began my decades long interest, fascination, and ultimate infatuation with this plant, this drug. 

I started using marijuana (and drinking, and cigarettes) regularly by the time I was 14 all with my parents approval and even encouragement. By the time I was 17 I could hold my drink and smoke with any man. I thought at the time (as did my delinquent friends) that my parents were  cool for this, but in retrospect I realize that they basically saddled my immature, undeveloped mind with these addictions and, as a consequence, I entered into adulthood at a huge disadvantage. Needless to say, I still carry around hurt, confusion, and anger towards them for this. 

Fortunately for me I met and married a great gal at 23 who made me want to become a better man and basically saved my life. I quit smoking cigarettes at age 25, the morning my son was born. Threw a nearly full pack in the dumpster behind the hospital and never looked back. I continued to drink and smoke weed heavily though. My wife, who has never used any substance, disapproved of my use but was extraordinary patient with me. I guess she saw something in me under all my exterior mess, something I was unable to even see in myself. 

I had an epiphany of sorts on my 30th birthday and, in what seems like a flash of insight, realized with crystal clarity that my health was THE most valuable possession that I would ever own and vowed from that moment forward to take an active ownership in my own health. I was very overweight and unfit and had high blood pressure, a future heart attack in the making. I quit drinking that day and never touched it again. It was tough as hell but next month will be 11 years of sobriety from alcohol. 

I started exercising daily (mostly running and cycling) and changed my relationship with food and went from 220 to 155 pounds in one year and have maintained this healthier weight ever since. 
Marijuana though proved,  and still proves, to be my hardest chemical crutch to hang up for good. I think it’s because it was so deeply ingrained into my psyche from such a young age. Everything just seemed so drab and uninteresting without it. I’ve quit weed many times over the past 10 years (hence my username), several of those times for over 1 year, once for over 2 years. I always seem to manage, though, regrettably, to find a way to return to this long lost love of mine. That’s the irresistible seductive power of this drug for me. I reach a point in my sobriety where I truly begin to feel joy and contentment in life without weed, and then, as if I forget why I quit, I pick it up again, only to quickly realize again why I quit in the first place. It’s a love/hate relationship, an abusive relationship, a viscous cycle. 

Throughout this whole process, I’ve fortunately been able to keep this side of me hidden from my son, who has no idea about this aspect of my life and would be shocked and confused if he were to ever find out. 

Last summer my 14 year old son and I rode bikes (bicycles) all the way across the country from Mexico to Canada, 2,400 miles, mostly on remote dirt roads, along the spine of the Rockies thru the states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. It took us 49 days and was an absolutely incredible experience for us both. We carried everything with us on our bikes and slept under the stars most nights. I wanted to show him, among other things, that you don’t need to have drugs and alcohol to have a good time. Something my own father failed miserably at teaching me. 

I hit my one year weed-free mark (again) while on that epic journey with my son and was very proud of myself for doing so because the cravings and opportunity for using were certainly present along the way, especially in Colorado. 

In what was really a sweet and generous gesture, my dad called me out of the blue and said he wanted to make the long 3 day drive to the Canadian border and pick us up instead of us taking the train home as we had planned. It was very nice of him. But here’s the thing, there are many things that trigger my impulsive urge to smoke weed, but none more powerful than the presence of my dad. I strongly associate the presence of my dad with smoking weed and, knowing this, worried that I would be unable to resist the urge during the long drive home. 

It wasn’t 30 minutes down the road when we stopped at a rest area. While my dad and son were using the rest room, I opened the glove box and grabbed my dad’s little tin box that I knew would be there. I quickly loaded a bowl and took 4 or 5 deep tokes and was almost instantly awash with that old familiar euphoric embrace mixed with equal parts shame and guilt. I smoked with my dad at the motel later on that night and again early the next morning and again the following night and morning but haven’t smoked again since. Even just smoking those 5 times brought about a period of withdrawals for me. . .anxiety, depression, etc. It only left me wanting more and more and more and MORE! Moderation for me, simply isn’t an option. Once is too many and a thousand times isn’t enough. 

I’m sitting here now with 6 months of complete sobriety and, though I do still think about and crave weed, I generally feel pretty good and have definitely reached a place where non-chemically-stimulated joy and contentment have returned to life. The addicted mind is a sneaky little persistent bastard and I feel now more than ever before that I’ve finally managed to wrap my hands around its slippery little neck and put it out of its self-induced misery once and for all. :)

If you’ve made it this far thank you for allowing me to share my story. Believe it or not I tried to keep it as brief as possible and left a lot of stuff out. I should write a book. ;) 

I love that folks from all backgrounds and walks of life can come here to this great community to give and receive encouragement and support to one another no matter where we happen to be in our shared struggle to break free from the chain that binds us. Much love and stay strong, friends! ❤️💪"
WEED IS THE REMOTE FROM CLICK Just fast forwarding and skipping the difficult parts thus missing everything and everyone you love.
"Today I’m celebrating 365 days of choosing myself over marijuana I really couldn’t have done it without this community. I’ve gotten so much advice, and found such a strong support system via this subreddit. I have no desire to go backward. I really love who I am now and I’m excited to keep going. Gonna make myself some blueberry pancakes to honor myself and my journey. 

Thanks to you all.

Edit: 
I want to answer some questions that I've been asked about my journey thus far:

I started smoking weed when I was around 20/21, and by the time I was 23, I was a pothead (I'm 30 now). I abused marijuana because I was depressed, lost and confused about my life trajectory, and wanted to numb the pain I felt about my career, and my family dynamics. I ruined many MANY relationships due to weed. I was not a thoughtful or present friend, and I went through long periods of time feeling lonely and misunderstood. I struggled with how to maintain my relationships, I couldn't keep up hobbies, my mental health tanked and I continued using weed to numb the pain.

I knew that I had to quit smoking for about 2 years before I actually did it. I was always bargaining with my addiction and trying to find a way, any way, to keep the high going. I cheated on urine tests (don't ask), stole from people, lied to get high.  Last April I hit rock bottom because at that point I had been smoking before and after work, and my performance suffered as a result. This also triggered further negative self-talk, and I smoked even more in order to cope. Finally, I was terminated due to an overall shitty performance, and I was RELIEVED because I knew that this was as bad as it could get and I had to make a change. I smoked my last J on April 7th 2019. 

The road to recovery sucked for a long time before it got better. I have had brief stints of sobriety (no more than 3 months) in the past, but always went back. This time I was so desperate for change that I found myself in NA/MA meetings, reading self-help books, meditating, changing my social circle. Just anything to get over the hump. I downloaded ""I Am Sober"" so that I could hold myself accountable (highly recommend). I knew that if I could just get to 6 months, I could get to a year. The normal withdrawals were there at first. I remember during the first few weeks having this....hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. It wasn't hunger...it was just emptiness. Emptiness at my core that I normally filled with weed. Waking up and not being able to fill that was incredibly hard to face. I cried a lot. and I also felt all of the anger, disappointment in myself, resentment, and sadness that I had allowed myself to ignore over the years. 

Getting clean didn't make me or my life perfect. I am so imperfect it's hilarious. But I am self-aware and I have the drive to improve as much as I can. I can feel emotions, I can feel bored and be ok with it. I can exercise, meditate, keep my space clean, and perform well at work without looking for a ""treat"" like a dog. I'm a grown ass woman! These are things that I'm supposed to do! I don't need a treat for getting up and handling my f*cking business. Idk I've just leveled up as a human being and I appreciate it. 

Someone asked if I crave weed anymore. No. The truth that I didn't want to face was that it hadn't felt ""good"" to smoke weed for a long time. In fact, it was starting to suck. I didnt like how I felt at all. I didn't like how my day would be gone as soon as I lit up. The problem was that I was so stuck in the web that I couldn't get out of the habit, so I convinced myself that I liked it. 

If I could give any advice at this point, it would be to please keep going. You went however many years of your life before that first toke surviving and living JUST FINE without weed. You don't NEED this. Not to be happy, not to be social, not to find a movie interesting, not to eat, not to fuck. Remove the veil and take a closer look at who you really are inside. Also, relapse is a part of the journey. Don't hate yourself for slipping up. Get back on that horse and don't look back. Forgive yourself for your past mistakes and love yourself enough to know that you deserve the best that life can offer. It's not over for you! As my dad says: There's never a happy ending in the middle of the story, so keep on living!"
This happened... 
"I FOUND A JOINT AND THREW IT AWAY- DAY 38 I clean for a living. While stripping beds at a rental cabin, there it was. A joint. Under the pillow. Like left just for me.

I stared at it. Picked it up. Felt that familiarity in my fingertips. Sniffed it- it smelled good. I hesitated. Put it in my pocket for later? 

This was a big moment. I stood with it in my hand, feeling like I was on a hidden camera show, being tested by the universe. I pictured myself at home, sitting on my back steps, smoking. 

Then I threw it away. In the trash. A full joint. IN. THE. TRASH. 

That felt good. Day 38 after 18 years. I'm good."
New 420 goals 
"Things I do not miss about weed: - Wasting money.
- Waiting around for a drug dealer only to be ripped off.
- Feeling pissed off if im unable to score. 
- Not being able to remember anything.
- Feeling anxious and depressed all the time.
- Oversleeping and waking up feeling more tired than when I went to bed.
- Having dark and sunken looking eyes. 
- Getting the munchies and eating shitty food all the time. 
- Having absolutely no motivation. 
- Having trouble articulating my words. 
- Not being able to feel relaxed without being stoned. 
- Wasting time lying around all day. 

Really makes me realise how much the cons outweigh the pros."
"The pitfall of being “weed happy” Here is what I have discovered in my stepping away from cannabis. When I would smoke, getting high was always the same. It was a predictable and familiar experience I call “weed happy.” Weed happy doesn’t change, it is always the same experience, and no matter what else is going on, when I smoked I just got weed happy.

Since stepping back from cannabis, all other forms of happiness emerge. Some are much more difficult to achieve, but the joy experienced is powerful (like the joy of finishing a long week of work, or even the joy of waking up the day following a day of intense craving, but choosing not to smoke). 

Whenever I used to smoke to celebrate, the organic joy of whatever I had accomplished vanished, and I was just weed happy again. 

Understand that weed happy is a very specific, very narrow type of joy, and other greater deeper happinesses are out there, you just have to work harder to get them. But trust me, they are worth it."
It’s is 4:20 PM which means this is my first sober 24 hours in 15 years. Just wanted to share a tiny victory.
My first kid is due tomorrow and I couldn't be more happy with my progress! 
"High me wants to be sober, but sober me wants to be high. I hate it. I love it. It's a cycle that's been going on for years. I feel like weed changed me for the better, but it was a long time ago that I started. Now I feel I have learnt all there is to learn from it and I just abuse it. 

At night time when I'm high I feel it in my being that I dont want to be this way, but when I wake up in the morning it's like I've completely forgotten how high me feels about smoking, and all I can think about is making sure I have enough to get to that state again... and when  I do, I feel like I dont want to be smoking. 

I feel so stupid


Edit:

Wow! I wasnt expecting this to resonate with so many. I've read all of your comments and all I can say is that you all sound like such incredibly good and supportive people. I'm proud to be a stoner if only to be grouped with you guy's. Now it's time to prepare to get back to being the real me. And hopefully soon I'll be able to help some of you like you have helped me. 

Good luck everyone, you guys are awesome!"
"Stopping Smoking Weed Doesn’t Solve All Your Problems, It Allows You to Realise What Your Problems Are I am one month sober today having smoked daily since I was 13 years old. 28 now.

Finally able to take responsibility for things I have been suppressing and feeling tons better.

It can get pretty lonely during this isolation, especially when you are clear headed for the first time in years. It also is bringing back a lot of emotions and my mind seems to be processing things that happened a long time ago.

Excited for the THC to finally be leaving my body.

Instead of smoking I now go out for evening walks, workout twice a day and eat healthily. 

I also have managed to stop drinking beers. The first week or so after I stopped smoking I seemed to be replacing it with a few bottles each night. Had only a few beers total the last 2 weeks.

All in all I am feeling so much better and highly recommend anyone lurking here wondering whether to try stopping or not to give it a go. I wish I had done it years ago!

Thanks to everyone here for their continued support :)"
80 days sober! Here's a comic I made a couple weeks ago about how I've changed 
"Just paid off 3 of my credit card debts with the money I haven't spent on weed 💅 Even though I'm mostly out of cash rn, it feels super good. I'm at my parents house so I don't spend much on anything. Weed used to drain my wallet like crazy; I don't even know how I kept up with all that shit. 

Don't smoke, ppl. Spend that hard-earned money on yourselves. 🌊"
"The goal isn't to be sober, it's to love yourself so much that you don't need to smoke. Love yourself."
"To anyone who caved yesterday like me... let it be a lesson as to the power of addiction. For me, being at my university house is where problems arise. I have the freedom to smoke where I want and when I want, I have dealers on call, lots of places to order takeaway...

I came home for the virus and because we were locked down, I stopped for a couple of weeks. After the first week is where I start to realise what a grip weed has on me.

I was irritable all the time, I was unhappy and slightly depressed. I didn’t want to talk to people, didn’t want to really do anything ‘valuable’ like study or workout.

Then weed comes back into play... boredom turns into ‘if only I had some weed’ or ‘it would so nice to smoke and do nothing right now’. Your brain TRICKS YOU into remembering all the good times you had smoking.

So what did I do? I made up a lie that I needed to go back to university to get some work done, and that I’d be back in a week. I wasn’t coming here to work, I was coming here so I could smoke again. I went out of my way, and had my parents drive me over an hour, just so I could smoke.

I won’t lie to you and say I didn’t mean to do this. The whole time I was on the way here, I was so so happy I could smoke again. I was fucking IN LOVE with the idea I could smoke a spliff again.

And you know what? It fucking sucked. I’ve been in a hole for two days, smoked 3 grams that was meant to last me a week in a day and a half. When I was high I found myself depressed, anxious, paranoid and everything in between. The feeling of ‘why have I done this?’ came back immediately.

And there’s the lesson. Addiction will literally have you LOVE the idea of doing it again, just one more time. Reality sets in and you’re back to square one.

Day one again for me. I’m going back home after two days because I know I will make no progress here. I am so so scared that in a week I will want to smoke again and lose my motivation, but here is proof that’s the wrong decision."
"You never hit rockbottom with weed im 26 yo and I started smoking when I was 14yo. It very quickly became a huge part of my life and I would smoke on weekends in the beginning and by 20 I was smoking everyday whenever I can. It just becomes part of your life and there is such a culture around it. A lot of my good friends also smoke weed everyday and for at least 5 years I have wanted to quit but never had the willpower to do it.

&#x200B;

I'm a comic and a writer and weed completely saps all my momentum. I realized that there is no rockbottom with weed. I am never going to lose my house and ruin all my relationships, but it does have a glass ceiling. It prevents me from actually making something of myself. I want a lot in this life time and weed just seems like its an anchor around my neck.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I think I ruined my brain, smoking all through my developing years, but I try not to think that way. I do not even think weed is inherently bad for you, it just my personal relationship has become very unbalanced and has encroached into an addiction.

&#x200B;

On top of everything I only would smoke spliffs (weed and tobacco) so I am quitting both substances at the same time.

&#x200B;

Anyway I am almost a week into quitting cold turkey and honestly I feel really great :) no insane cravings its just kind of hard to sleep. Just want to make this post so it is even more real for me.

&#x200B;

Thanks guys"
"Day 7,306: I'm Subduction, founder of r/leaves, and today marks 20 years free of cannabis, alcohol, and other drugs. I wanted to contribute some thoughts on anniversaries, and I'm happy to stick around today to answer any questions and chat about whatever you like. Hey everybody!

For those who don't know me (or know me only from getting mod notices!) I founded r/leaves seven years ago, and have had the best front row seat imaginable as each of you grew this sub into the kind, supportive, and wonderful place that it is.

My official quit date is July 15th, 1998, which is the day that I entered the Smithers Rehab Center in New York City for outpatient treatment. I spent just over a year there and I credit my experience at Smithers with my sobriety, and many of the things I learned there are built into r/leaves.  

So, what are my pillars of recovery?  What are the SEVEN SECRETS TO KEEPING YOUR SOBRIETY! NUMBER SIX WILL AMAZE YOU?! 

There are, as you might imagine, so many after 20 years, so I spent a little time in the past few days trying to think of the answer to the question *""If you could only tell people one thing, one piece of advice to help them keep their sobriety, what would it be.?""*  

After a good amount of thought, I think it's: 

>***""One day at a time isn't just a mantra or an encouragement, it's a concrete strategy.""***

I see so many posts here on leaves like *""How can I possibly quit for the rest of my life?""*

The addiction community is full of sayings, and one of them is *""don't look up, don't look down.""*  A lifetime can feel unachievable, so it's a temptation to never start.  Or, as your day count increases it can feel unsustainable and tempt you to give up. 

So don't quit for a lifetime, don't quit for a month or a week.  Just quit for today. Promise yourself that no matter how bad it gets, you simply won't smoke today.  If it's awful and it makes you decide that you never want to quit again as long as you live then that's fine, but you still aren't going to smoke today.  You'll start up again tomorrow.

Then, tomorrow morning, promise yourself again.

Keep your scope achievable.  There are no points for difficulty -- if you make it through a day without smoking you win.

Does it work?  Well, the only thing I can promise from my personal experience is that although I have no idea what tomorrow will bring, I can promise it works for at least 7,306 days.  :-)

I'll be around for the rest of the afternoon and evening to chat about anything you're curious about -- thanks everyone for making this the place that it is.  

-- Subduction"
"My use got so bad that I checked myself into a rehab center At first I felt stupid... why am I going to rehab? It’s “just weed”. After being here for three days I realize it’s the best move I’ve made in years. Several people here are here for weed too. 

I have to remind myself that I’m not weak for being here. This is really the best thing I can do for myself. Smoking weed all day long for 12 years sunk me into a deep depression. 

I can do this


Edit: thanks everyone. Your words have all been so kind and affirming. Love you all!"
"My mother died on Saturday. Today marks 6 months sober. I *could* get high, or drunk, but I won't.

Cancer took her from me, but I refuse to let my addiction take the memories I've just made of her, even the ones that hurt to think about.

I have regretted getting high a million times during my period of use. I have not regretted being sober **once** since I stopped.

Mom got to see me clear-headed for the first time in two decades, got to see me succeed in getting my first technology certification, got to see me moving back into tech with a healthy mindset (and brain). 

Without sobriety, that wouldn't have happened, and I'd be well on my way to losing my memories of her in a haze.

If you're thinking about quitting, do it. If you fall short, pick yourself up and try again. Figure out *why* you want to smoke, then address that and try again.

You'll get there, and I suspect you won't regret it.

I don't.

Edit:

I'd like to thank each of you individually for your responses, but I think you can understand why that is a little more than I'm able to give right now. I hope this ""group message"" will suffice.

Thank you for your support and kind words. I'm still (very) numb over the whole process, as I and my wife were needed to provide the end-of-life support for mom; I saw her looking very different than I was expecting, but thanks to my support team (i.e. wife) we were able to help her pass with the greatest amount of dignity, kindness, and love that we could. Now it's time to work through the papers and get her estate in order so dad doesn't have to struggle with anything but his grief.

Your words helped me to let go of some of the pain I'm feeling. I have a hard time crying over just about anything, and many of your responses brought me to tears, and much-needed relief. I'm glad that I've been able to provide inspiration to some of you, as it makes this pain a little more positive.

This hurts *so badly*. I wouldn't trade it for even a single moment of drug-induced ""peace"".

Get sober. Stay sober. Do it for yourself, not for anyone else. It's going to hurt, but that's an important part of being alive and being here, now.

Be here now. You can do it."
"Weed changes people :( Just needed to vent my feelings as I feel like I’ve only just started seeing how weed truly affected my life and my relationships.

A couple of years ago I met a guy and I instantly felt something. We worked together and soon began talking more and more, we eventually ended up seeing each other. I soon learnt that he had issues with substances in the past and he had been sober for many years, which I thought was amazing :)

We had so much fun together, he was the love of my life and I adored everything about him.
We would do things together, go out to eat, go fishing, spend time in nature and just enjoy each others company. 

Months passed, and it seemed almost too good to be true. We would never fight and we were best of friends until he reintroduced the weed back into his life. At first it was just to sleep and he would only smoke at night before bed, and a very minimal amount at that. Sometimes we would even share some and have a great night !
After a few months the weed became more easily accessible and he fell back into the cycle of smoking from the morning to the night and I followed in his footsteps.

The man I once loved began to turn into a careless and lazy person and I felt as if each day he was becoming more and more distant.
Life became all about smoking weed and it was all we did together to the point that we weren’t even being intimate because we were both too stoned out of our minds. We were both addicted and it was breaking us apart.

It seemed that with each day came a new issue or argument, we just didn’t seem to understand each-other anymore. He became mean spirited and seemed to enjoy tormenting me. Eventually I left 

I was now alone, and I had never missed someone so much. I began smoking more and more, smoking bongs all the time. What happened to him began to happen to me.
I became distant with my family and friends and I became lazy and felt so lost. Now I can see so clearly that marijuana changed us both to the point that we were no longer compatible.

I can’t help but feel so incredibly guilty about the person I became. I am so sorry to my family and friends that I may have hurt and I feel so embarrassed I let myself believe that weed was this harmless fix for my problems.

I am so beyond happy I found this support group and I thank anyone who takes the time to read this !x

Here’s to the rest of our lives sober and happier than ever 💖"
Epiphany: When i have weed it's easy to imagine quitting; when i don't any weed it's easy to imagine smoking repsonsibly. Anybody else feel like this?
"Do NOT use will power to quit weed (How I quit) To quit weed we need to change our mindsets around the substance, fighting your way out of the addiction with willpower is a futile method of quitting because it is a limited resource.

Our brains are hard wired to seek pleasure and avoid pain, therefore, if you are fighting your way through your addiction with willpower it sends messages to the brain that it's pleasurable to smoke weed and painful to quit. You can fight for days, weeks, maybe even months with this method but there comes a time where you end up caving in.

Your saying to yourself no I can't have that joint, I would really love a bowl right now but I cant, don't smoke weed, don't go out and buy weed etc.

 The alternative is, instead of fighting your cravings, when they arise just say to yourself ""I'm so happy that I am now someone who doesn't smoke weed"", ""I'm so happy I no longer need to waste money on something that ruins my physical and mental health"", ""I'm so happy that I can now have real growth and progress in my life"", ""I'm so happy that I now have more then enough energy to get things done and am feeling great"".

This is associating pleasure with not smoking weed and pain with continuing that cycle, now your brain is on board and cravings will lessen. Also always make sure to observe your cravings instead of wrestling with them. The second you start getting in that inner dialogue with your brain like yeah I'm happy I quit but 1 toke wouldn't hurt, don't react to that thought, just observe it and let it pass without judgement"
"2 months sober today. Don’t really have anyone to celebrate or share this with so just thought I’d come here to do so. Wouldn’t be be at this point without this sub and I don’t really share my journey into sobriety with friends and family on social media but I wanted to share this occasion as I’m quite proud of myself for making it this far.

My will is starting to falter but I’ve been down the relapse road before and I know exactly where I’ll end up; smoking everyday and feeling super shitty/ disappointed with myself, vowing to get clean again ecs ecs. Here’s to another 2 months and beyond!

If you took the time to read this, thank you! Have a wonderful night and stay safe. Sending my love and support to those who need it."
"The first few times, weed will reveal the world to you. After getting addicted and abstaining...Sobriety reveals yourself to you. We've all been there. Truly profound thoughts on the world, society, creativity, ideas, spirituality etc. 

How long does that last? What's the outcome after all those thoughts? For me: Nothing. Just more smoking and more thinking without any action. I'm sure there are many people who can function remarkably well smoking everyday, without any negative consequences ... but that is not me. 

I sat at around 21days sober for the first part of December. The festive mood around Christmas and being around other smokers, i decided to end my streak. I was quickly back at smoking 4 times a day, waking and baking etc. I'm so disappointed but i want to pick up the pieces and start again...

At the height of my sober streak i cleaned out a cupboard in my bedroom that i have literally never sorted out for more than 10 years. I never used the cupboard for 10years cos it was unusable because it was full of clutter. That is absolutely stupid when i think about it, but my stoner mind was never bothered about getting down to it... cos well video games, Netflix etc. 

There's a childlike feeling that comes from sobriey/abstinence. A child never feels happy because of a substance. A child generates happiness from experiences. 

I remember a sober day towards the end of the streak.. i had had a great workout. Weights. Cranked out 5 intense sets. Energy levels were returning. The Witcher was playing in the background... i was buzzing. Felt like a man again for the first time in i dunno how long. That same child like natural high. 

There's probably so much more that weed/addiction costs us, than meets the eye.

Edit: Thanks a million for the responses and upvotes. I really appreciate them all! Best of luck to all!"
"Weed absolutely wrecks your reward systems, making smoking the only truly rewarding thing in your life. Marijuana has a powerful effect on a persons reward system. Now, this is not apparent if you smoke once or twice a month, or maybe even a week, but the reason we are all here is because we can't do that. Most of us here are 5 times a week + smokers. Many are also wake and bakers, who can't remember the last time they went more than half a day not stoned. 



The only real problem with weed, and I'm honestly gonna say there is not many of them, is it wreaks havoc on your ability to enjoy life without it. How many times have you said ""I'm gonna get high and then..."" only to not do it and usually end up high on your couch for the rest of the evening? 



This is because your brains natural rewards system, which increases feelings of happiness and contentment, is being heavily compromised by marijuana. Usually the things you smoke to escape from are actually not bad things. They are things that are actually important in life, such as your studies, career goals, or general things that NEED to get done.



All marijuana does is force you to live in the moment. Now this isn't always bad, but when the moment subsides you still have the same issues as before only now a day has passed and you are potentially in a worse position than before.



Marijuana has a time and place for sure. It is a beautiful drug that can deeply enrich a lot of experiences, or open a newfound appreciation for things we take for granted. However when used in excess, just like MDMA, alcohol, cocaine, or other drugs its effects can be devastating.



The thing with those other drugs is that they are rather destructive, and you usually can't go long as a daily user without your life collapsing in some aspects. Weed doesn't do that. Weed can create the illusion that everything is fine and youre content, but what you've really done is lowered your standards for your life.

Although marijuana does make experiences better, how many of them can you actually remember? At the time the movie seems amazing, the music sounds heavenly, a simple walk in the park may be euphoric; but when you come back to reality, how much of this benefits your future self?


Personally, I've found the only way to get over the desire for weed is to cut it out entirely. The problem with using weed as an amplifier is that that becomes your new norm, and life's occasional monotony becomes overwhelming without the crux of marijuana to entertain you.



Life isn't meant to be 100% fun and happy games all the time. A lot of the time it's fucking boring and mundane. Work isn't meant to be fun. School isn't meant to be fun. But it's rewarding. Compare the reward to choosing between a salad or burger for dinner. The burger will be instantly rewarding, like marijuana, but may make you feel badly afterwards. The salad on the other hand will be something that could benefit you in the future, like school, like work, you eat it because of an overarching goal.



The best way to get over weed is to not have it. If you set aside a day every weekend, or second week, or even month; that is still your reward, and subconsiously you are looking forward to that more and not living in the moment.

When I say moment in this context, I don't mean the high moments we have all had, but rather living with a clear view of your future goals and making the most of any opportunities that are presented before you. The moment is beautiful, life can be beautiful, but it's work, hard work. The hard work isn't forever though, its a lot of initial effort to get to where you want to get to, and then that becomes the new norm and youve entered a new state of being; a new and better you.

One of the best motivators to quit weed is to sit down and make a list of every time weed has adversely affected your life, compared to its positive. You'll find weeds positives are limited to food tasting good, some funny chat's with friends, and the occasional moment of drug-induced epiphany. These aren't tangible or real experiences, and they don't really serve to enrich your life in any way. Sure, they can be fun, but real things like exercise, study, learnt skills, and romance are things with actual value to your life.

Really sit down and write down every time weed had a negative impact, every time you didn't plan as well as you could have because you were high, every time you broke a promise to your significant other or family about smoking, every time you missed out on an opportunity because you preferred to sit alone by the dim light of your TV while you ate pop tarts and watched Family Guy.



Don't smoke, just don't do it. But don't sit around home being sad, go out! Join a gym, learn martial arts, go running, learn to play guitar. Do one of the many, many, MANY things you can still do while you're young and have time. When you really start living in the moment, you'll realise how much little time we have in the day, and how precious each second is.



Weed has a time and place, but right now it's not for you. That's why you're on the page. LIVE!"
"lol. Doing some groceries and walked up to the cashier. The cashier replaced each other and she passed next to me, she points to the ground she says  ""Is this your bag of weed?"" 

I picked it up. Looked at those freaking big buds for a moment... 

I said, 'No'. And gave it back to her, 

I replied ""He's probaly too stoned to find it back."" We both laugh and she stores it behind the counter. Walked out the supermarket and craved like hell for a minute. 

Then I reminded myself, addiction is one hellava feeling 

Moved on with my day. 

On day 33 now. 

Proud but cravy.

Letsgetitit!"
My therapist asked me who was in the driver's seat of my decisions if I'm high all the time.. 5 days clean so far! 
"I think smoking weed was actually CAUSING a good amount of my anxiety For the past year and a half or so I’ve smoked weed pretty much every night to help me sleep as well as to calm me down after a long day, a few days ago I made the decision to stop smoking due to how horrible I felt and how my lungs sounded after I decided to start jogging for fitness. I’m half way through my shift at work today and I have felt little to no anxiety compared to how awful my work days went before and it is such a fantastic feeling, I just wanted to share because it came as such a surprise to me, I’m very glad I made the decision to quit."
"My life isn't dull without weed. Weed makes my life dull. I'm done smoking weed.

I'm so annoyed with feeling like I need to get high before I do anything. I can convince myself whatever the task is, it'll be better after I smoke. It *never* is. What I'm really feeling is my brain seeking comfort because it's so used to the instant gratification that it fights to avoid anything related to delayed gratification.

I've used the excuse that all my friends smoke, so I can't quit. I'm my own keeper. My friends will still love me.

Thanks for listening. I think this is the time it finally sticks. Wish me luck!"
"TODAY MARKS 1 YEAR OF SOBRIETY AFTER 22 YEARS OF CHRONIC ABUSE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU TELL YOURSELF, HERES THE TRUTH. “IF I CAN DO IT SO CAN YOU”. HERES MY RANT!!!! Today marks exactly 365 days of sobriety and I thought I would just let the fellow stoner know that it is possible. A happy drug free life is possible.
The truth is that nobody except you is going to keep you sober, you have to really want this thing and you have to make arrangements with yourself to get through it.  
I won’t sit here and try to bullshit you by saying every day has been beautiful bliss, there has been some challenges along the way. Mainly because once I stopped smoking heavy heavy grass, shatter, dabs, rigs, jiggs, edibles, hash, diamonds, keef and mother fuckin butterzzzz well then I realized the main reason I was always high was because I felt so uncomfortable sober.  I had been running from myself and reality for 22 consecutive years from the age of 15 to 37 (roughly).  I was spending thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars at dispensaries and with shady dealers back in the day simply self medicating my own bullshit.  The problem was the medication called marijuana  was compounding my internal struggles, it was fuelling  my anxiety, compounding my depressions, shattering my self esteem, isolating me from all the support I truly wanted and absolutely destroying my marriage and relationship with my 2 children.  I have since had my 3rd child sober and a new little puppy to boot! 
When you become vulnerable with yourself and admit that you have a serious problem then you can begin to make the necessary changes to fix it, the thing you must remember is to never lose the dark reality of what it was like when you were using. 
Some of my hardest days in this year were when I was doing great and everything was nice and I had money and the kids were happy and my wife was back in love, then I would suddenly tell myself “WELL ITS NOT SO BAD, why can Kyle and joe smoke a blunt and I can’t,  it would be fine right, I mean I’m better now” Those were the moments in my sobriety that I had to really see what my old addiction was trying to do and had to remember how bad it really was at the end of using, I knew that if I have one puff just one puff, the obsession of getting stoned will return and that is not something I am willing to do.  Joe and Kyle may be ok but me no way man if I have one puff I’m smoking the whole god damn bag and that’s real talk.
I want everybody to know NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE AND HOW DEEP YOU ARE INTO THE ADDICTION that they can do it and they just have to get through the waves to get the feeling of surfing that good life without everyday struggle and obsession.  I know what it’s like I was as addicted as it comes, ALL DAY EVERYDAY NO MATTER WHAT was the type of chronic I was for 22 years, didn’t matter the country, the job, the relationship, the event, driving, flying, diving I was constantly stoned. 

Here’s a little advise to help you through 

Be gentle and respect your own recovery

Support yourself, do things that are positive 

Be ready for days of battle with your mind, be prepared to let go of the old you 

Be honest with people around you, let them know you are struggling or having a hard day 

Don’t be hard on yourself if you do slip, but don’t let the slip turn into a ten year slide 

Meditate, I’m serious this shit works 

Love yourself and enjoy the journey with all the ups and downs.

Ask for help if you need it, that is true strength!

Try not to replace one bad addiction with another

Try all those things you wanted to try but we’re always to scared to try

Last but not least HAVE FUN IN YOUR RECOVERY!!!! 

As you build traction in your own recovery you will see that life is quite beautiful and amazing without drugs, without constant refuelling.

Take it from me and the many others that have walked this journey, it has its benefits mostly being you get to finally be with your true self and available to others all the time at anytime.

Thank you for 1 year thank you for today.!!!!!"
"Why you need to quit smoking cannabis - A note to myself Why you need to quit smoking cannabis - A note to myself

I wrote this for myself but decided to share since we are all in the same boat. It’s a collection of my thoughts on why I am quitting and quotes that motivate me to stay sober.

-When you smoke it you want to keep using until there is none left

-You continually seek cannabis even against your best judgment.

-It zaps your motivation to study

-Your contempt with yourself where your at and don’t strive to improve 

-It makes you dull and tired

-You socially distance yourself from friends family and ultimately new experiences 

-It costs lots of money / that money could be invested 

-Your personality ends up being built around it
-You miss tons of social and travel opportunities

-A high life is a unfulfilled one

-A man is someone who puts others needs before his own. Can you say you do that when your high all the time?

-Your less alert and unable to make clear decisions.

-You neglect the health of your body

-You neglect hobbies 

-Your best self isn’t dependent on a substance

-You get too comfortable. Remember comfort Is good in moderate doses, but being uncomfortable/facing adversity is what helps us to grow. 

“Purpose over pleasure” -Wes Watson

-You aren’t present enough to have a feasible or profitable side hustle 

-You neglect spiritual growth

-“Pot makes you okay with feeling bored and it’s when your bored you should be learning a new skill or discovering a new science. If you smoke pot all the time you may look back and realize you never made progress with anything.” South Park quote

-It messes with your weigh and appetite.

-It’s not a source of true happiness. 

-It masks your emotions

You don’t need it
It’s going to be hard
Your brain is going to try and trick you 
That temporarily pain will go away
The temporary pleasure is not worth it
Please do not smoke

You could always smoke again. Weed will be around forever. The thing is though, YOU won’t. No one is going to hold a gun to your head and force you to smoke. It’s all on you... Because of that, the key is to stay consistent in your thoughts of why you quit. It’s YOUR attitude and YOUR commitment to being disciplined that will drive you to your goals, not weed. Don’t fall for the illusion of comfort you think it’ll bring.

Your time here is NOT guaranteed and you cannot afford to be distracted the way cannabis makes you.

You will need reminders some days. Maybe often. But it’s about consistency and discipline. 

If your life was a movie, what would the hero of that movie do? Do that! -Joe Rogan

Do you see a full length film about you sitting in the closet and getting high all the time? Or would it be about overcoming struggles, providing selflessly for those around you and striving for personal growth each day? 

“Be stern on self, kind and compassionate to others” - Wes Watson

Don’t become complacent once you make progress. Remember why you quit and refer to this often. 

—————————————————————

I went on a 60+ day bender after getting to 134 days clean. That “just one more time” immediately evolved into a daily habit. IMMEDIATELY! I’ve smoked daily for about 7 years now and it’s time to get my act together.

Honestly this go around has been much harder for me. I’m having a much more intense withdrawal this go around.  I’m nearing the end of day 4 and I am feeling slightly better but the first few days were hard.

It’s doable though...

REMEMBER WHY YOUR PART OF THIS SUB.

It’s time to use this time in my life to get disciplined and go after my goals in life. It’s never too late for that.

TLDR: a collection of quotes and notes on why I need to quit smoking. Posted as it may resonate with some of you. 

Sorry for the unorganized rant and
For any grammar/formatting issues. On mobile. 😅

Edit: WOW! Did not expect this to blow up the way it did. Thank you all for the kind words and for sharing your experiences/stories as well. This just shows we’re all in this together. Stay strong folks! ✌️❤️😎"
"While smoking what was hopefully my last bowl yesterday, my pipe fell out of my pocket and broke on the pavement. Can’t think of a better sign that it’s time. For a long time it’s been habitual and not recreational, and it’s been exacerbating my mental health issues. Bud used to help. I don’t think it is now."
"One year sober down the drain: A lesson. I was on this subreddit a lot two years ago when I decided to quit weed.  My goal was to get to a year sober.

And I fucking made it. I was so proud.  I made it a year and a half even, before I decided to try some edibles while I was in Colorado over Christmas break.

It was fine. It was pretty nice actually.  I brought the rest of the package home.   I used occasionally and it wasn't a problem. It was pretty enjoyable actually.

A couple months later I moved in to an apartment with my girlfriend.  I had said that I would try smoking again when we had our own place.  We were staying at my mom's house for a few months before that.

We got the place and I've never been so happy. We went and bought some bud (legal state) and celebrated.

It was pretty nice.   But it started to get out of hand really quickly.

All the willpower I had built up from quitting two years ago went down the drain and I started using every day after work , and eventually even during the day sometimes and before work.

My point is that I don't know if I can ever go back or do this in moderation. I thought I could, but I quickly went back to old habits.

I loved being sober. I built my dreams.  The things I do and have today exist because of my sobriety. And now I want to get back to that.

But it is very hard.  I'm back on day three now of quitting   and it sucks. I'm very irritable. I can't focus on my work.

But anyways, here we go again.  Let's beat this addiction again. 💪 🙏"
Made a list for myself to keep me in check 
"Today I didn't get high before work I usually can't help myself, and I have a good job that I need to prove my worth for. Happy, today I didn't have wake n bake for the first time."
"Went to a party sober I went to a bday party this Saturday and there were Hella drugs and weed. I got asked to roll a joint a few times bc I do roll some nice J's and I wasn't event tempted to smoke. Said ""no thanks I don't smoke weed anymore"" and kept it at a few drinks and everyone respected that! 

I'm almost 7 weeks sober now and I'm damn proud of my progress tbh. My best friend also kept me busy so I wouldn't get focused on it and I'm very thankful for that as well.

It keeps getting easier with each new week :)"
Just had a piss test Had my first piss test after quitting the herb 33ish days ago and I passed. Got offered a new job where I'll be earning a extra 30% week. Im so happy with myself. Thought I would post it here. Yeeeehaaah
Day 365 - one full sober year! 
"When I’m High I want to Quit. When I Quit I want to be High. It’s funny because almost every time I smoke I have this feeling like ‘why did I just do that?’ Then I sober up and I’m like ‘when can I do that again?’

It’s so weird. Then I talk to my inner-sober-self and say ‘why are you always saying I should quit?’

It’s crazy. To the people around me I’m so ‘high-functioning’ that they think I’m silly for trying to quit. They say ‘why? You have it all under control. It’s like your glass of wine at the end of the night’ but deep down inside I feel like a daily smoker cannot be functioning at their full potential. 

Anyway. Long story short. This is why I haven’t been able to quit fully. When I don’t smoke I think I’m depriving myself from some sort of treat that I am deserving of. And, when I do smoke I feel like I’m depriving myself of a better lifestyle. 

I only post this here because I see a lot of members saying things like ‘you will quit when you really want to.’ But sometimes I ask what about those of us who don’t ‘want’ to but maybe should? 

Here’s to Sober October.

*

Wow. Just went on my lunch break and saw all these comments. Thank you everyone for commenting and giving some different perspectives. Great community here."
192 days weed FREEEEE after 21 years of chronic daily use. The world is yours just admit you have a problem. Let me tell you this side of the fence boy oh boy the grass is so so so so much greener. YOU CAN DO THIS !!!! One day at a time you will feel the magic come back into your life naturally 
Reminder: whatever crappy feeling you have - weed won’t help but will only add a foggy layer of regret and self loathing. You need to find a way to ride the waves without resorting to destructive habits.  Stay strong friends.
"A poem that has been a huge help in my sobriety...if it can help me quit, hopefully it can help some of you too ""I walk down the street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I fall in.
I am lost... I am helpless.
It isn't my fault.
It takes forever to find a way out.

I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I pretend I don't see it.
I fall in again.
I can't believe I am in the same place.
But, it isn't my fault.
It still takes me a long time to get out.

I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I see it is there.
I still fall in. It's a habit.
My eyes are open.
I know where I am.
It is my fault. I get out immediately.

I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I walk around it.

I walk down another street."" 

After 10 years of daily smoking in order to cope with PTSD after an abusive relationship, this poem woke me up. Any time I have even the slightest craving I mutter the final line to myself and feel empowered...*i walk down another street*"
"Weed is the most deceptive drug out there. It's currently day 4 of no weed and I feel like an absolute mess. Depressed, no energy, no appetite, very little sleep.

I feel like I wasted my youth away in a constant stoned daze. Started smoking it when I was 15 and I'm now 34. I'll never be able to get those years back and it's really fucking with my head to be honest. I feel so ashamed of myself. I'm absolutely fucking disgusted with myself.

I always told myself that weed was harmless, ""it just relaxes me bro"", you know the bullshit we all come out with. The irony is I once had a benzodiazepine habit and I found that easier to quit than weed. Here's comes the daunting realisation that weed is just as addictive and harmful as any other drug.

I think what has made weed so addictive to me is the fact that you lie to yourself and tell yourself it's not doing you any harm, when in reality you're an underachieving stoner. Without the weed addiction you'd have a better life by now and would have achieved much more in life. Facts. 

I've come to the conclusion that weed is the most deceptive drug out there. Everyone knows heroin or crack will fuck your life up very quickly, but almost nobody who smokes weed realises that it has them by the balls worse than any other drug and is doing real damage to life and relationships."
"What it really does to me * It makes me socially awkward.
* It makes me forget important dates.
* It makes me forget about my friends and family.
* It makes me dull. 
* It lets me enjoy experiences, but then forget about that enjoyment.
* It steals my dreams.
* It sabotages my relationships. 
* It empties my bank account.
* It makes me eat more than I should.
* It makes me spend money on things that I shouldn’t.
* It damages my lungs.
* It makes me use it when I don’t want to.
* It prevents me from getting important things done.
* It sticks around the next morning and keeps me in a daze.
* It eliminates my passion for things.
* It causes me to waste hours on meaningless activities.
* It makes me smell bad.
* It isn’t discreet, even though I tell myself that people don’t know, they know.
* It makes me bail out on my friends.
* It doesn’t let me sleep if I use it and then stop using it.
* It holds my appetite hostage if I use and then stop using.
* It makes me OK with doing nothing.
* It makes me OK with accomplishing nothing.
* It makes me paranoid about drug tests.

* It makes me fall into a repetitious cycle of laziness and sloth.
* It stops me from growing as a person.
* It prevents me from seeking out new experiences.
* It takes time away from the hobbies and activities that I truly enjoy.
* It prevents me from being me.

"3 months clean from all drugs and alcohol today, and 200 days clean from pot!!! Hey guys today's a very special day for me because, well, read the title!

I've been clean from pot for so long at this point that I am comfortable recalling past memories of using it without having any urge or desire to use it again. 

I think for some people, marijuana can be a useful creative and introspective tool; but where I stand, the entity behind Mary Jane and I don't get along. I still respect her, as she is a beautiful plant. But I become sick when I use her, I have an intolerance to her, or in other words, I'm ""allergic"" to her. 

Of course, as an addict I really am ""allergic"" to ALL drugs, but Mary Jane is my drug of choice; and while I saw some very beautiful and very pleasureable things while under her gaze, this is the exact reason why the substance is dangerous for me. 

I want to give a shoutout to any other recovering stoners trying to get sober and let you know that it IS POSSIBLE!!! I'm only 200 days in from all substances and I'm already feeling better than I ever have. Just take it one day at a time

Thanks guys"
"I turned 30 today and I’m 28 days clean from weed. Longest streak for me in 11 years and I’m looking forward to a healthy, optimal, weed free life. Thank you guys for the support! "
"Don’t Forget How Serious This Is You’re getting high on a drug every single day and never really sober. You’re wasting precious years in a hazy cloud blindly seeking pleasure while avoiding responsibilities and personal growth. You’re living a half life, dependent on an external substance to feel happiness and maintain a stable mental and physical state.

The situation is a 10/10

Weed helps you escape from reality and numbs you to your problems. Had a horribly long and stressful day at work? Don’t worry a couple bowls later you’ll be feeling dandy. Had a major fight with someone close to you and feeling shaken up? Smoke a half gram and you’ll forget all about it in no time. That numbing effect is perhaps one of marijuana’s most desirable qualities. However, that same effect also numbs you to the fact that you’re an addict and you’ve lost control. It numbs you to the fact your life is going downhill. That your relationships are suffering. That your memory is deteriorating. That your vitality is fading. That you haven’t been your true self in years. That the path you’re on is dark one with the bitterest of ends. 

Smoke if you want to. Tell yourself things aren’t that bad. That quitting can wait and you’ll get to it when your ready. Just remember though. You’re under it’s spell. And I assure you , the situation is a 10/10"
"Quit smoking 5 years ago. You might think it's a never ending struggle but it's not. I thought weed was going to be a part of my life forever. When I quit, I thought the struggle of not relapsing would be part of my life forever. I was wrong in both cases. It takes time but the struggle gets easier and eventually there is no struggle. Right now it's as if I never even tried it once. I can hardly remember the high anymore. I can hardly remember the urge. I can't remember the anxiety of smoking and not smoking. It's all history."
"Celebrating two weeks clean with a would be smoke spot, it feels good to be here clear headed. "
Just cause I quit smoking don't mean I don't still smoke 
"Smoked today after 6 months sober and can confirm, we aren't missing anything. I am approaching the end of my first semester of nursing school and I have been thinking I was missing weed lately...although I see now I was just being nostalgic about the act of it.

So, I have about a month or so before my next semester and figured if I am going to smoke, it should be now while I am out of school (also they random test at my school because we are in the hospital). 

Today, I smoked and it was blah. I zoned out, my conversations were dull. I felt genuinely apathetic about most things that crossed my mind. I noticed my heart rate increased and I actually felt less relaxed. I didn't really enjoy eating (which I expected to be enjoyable). I felt a bit dizzy and frustrated that I chose to smoke. However, this has been a lesson for me in my journey. Weed still sucks the life out of me. It is not cool or fun -- it drains me of my personality. I'm better off without it in my life.


So, if any of you out there are helped by reading this, that warms my heart. Tomorrow will be better for me and smoke free.

Edit: Just want to say THANK YOU to all of the members of this community who took the time to read and reply to me here. I did read every comment, even if I didn't reply. I appreciate all of you supporting each other and making this group what it is.

Also, this is easily my biggest post ever, so thanks for that record too!! :)"
"One whole year since I posted about quitting. What it’s like now. Today marks one whole year since I posted about my first day here. What I have noticed in one year...

One year ago I posted this. I had my first NA meeting and was going clean. It’s been one year free of pot and alcohol. 

I was a daily smoker. Loved it. Never an excuse not to smoke. I took a year off from my high stress job and filled my days with clouds of smoke.

The first few weeks and months were the hardest because you have to get used to living your life without that crutch. I used to work my ass off knowing I would have that smoke at the end of the night.  Nothing beat that feeling of taking my joint on the deck, lighting up and melting.

The first week was restlessness and anhedonia. I waited everyday until it was early enough to go to bed and then stared at the wall. It felt like wearing an itchy wool sweater. That’s how uncomfortable wearing my own skin was. I couldn’t imagine not smoking with every activity. Softball, snowboarding..running. I couldn’t imagine not having that with a smoke for the rest of my life. It was scary thinking of how will I do that. I carried around a Just For Today keychain in my hand as a security blanket for the first month.

I joined a lawyers support group and that really helped as I went through the 12 steps.

Now....

I’m so much happier. I used to think weed helped me with anxiety. The opposite is true. Weed creates the very anxiety it cures. Since quitting, my mood is way more balanced and my mental well being has improved dramatically. My job is litigation so it’s stressful. What’s different is that I can manage it without going off the deep end.

I’m way more active and present in my relationships with my friends and family. I no longer retreat and ignore calls when I’m high. I’m actually there and it feels good. My social anxiety is far lower.

I really got into snowboarding and nailed 17 days on the hill, mostly by myself getting my ass up at 5:00 for fresh tracks. It was hard because I always used to smoked a joint on the lift.  Sometimes I still miss it. I would never have been able to do this while high all the time.

What I noticed about my getting high before is that the most enjoyable part is the full joint, the light and the first puff. That was the best part. Actually being high.....much less fun. My journal from the year before I quit had so many entries of me saying “you don’t even like when you get high”

My favourite part is the feeling of being free from the cycle of smoke, high, anxiety, smoke, high.  My life used to revolve around that next joint. The next activity was planned around when that next joint was. I’m free of that cycle. I have energy for meaningful hobbies.

There are some smoker friends I don’t see as much anymore. My decision to get sober cost me the love of my life. He is a heavy drinker and when I got sober it was a change our relationship couldn’t handle. He is a wonderful successful person with many talents but as a sober person, being with someone who drinks a bottle and a half of wine a night and loves to party is not the right fit for me. It makes me sad that I no longer see the relationship for what it once was but now that I see it for what it is, I can’t unsee it.

People ask me if I will ever go back to having a smoke once in a while. The answer is no. I don’t have control over my consumption. One is too many a thousand is never enough. If I have one,I’ll rationalize once in a while and then from there to once a week, and then once a night and I’ll be back to regular habits. I’ve run my relationship with marijuana into the ground. The best thing I learned in meetings is that if you have to work at controlling or monitoring your consumption, your already past that point of having control.

I made the decision to quit alcohol as well. I was never a solo drinker but I didn’t want to get out of one trap to fall into another. Quitting alcohol was harder socially because drinking is everywhere (especially in law). After a while people just stopped asking me if I wanted a drink. When I go to events I have Diet Coke in a wine glass. I certainly feel uncomfortable when I’m the only one it drinking at a heavy drinking event but my discomfort won’t be solved by consuming ethanol products. It will be solved by being ok with being me. Still working on it. The only one who really gives a shit is me. No one else is really that interested with their own lives to care.

This post got quite rambley. However, just over a year ago I stumbled here, out of curiosity if my consumption was problematic or not. I kept coming back and reading and the more I read the stories of people here the more it started to click that something in my life wasn’t right.  

Thank you r/leaves. To those who lurk late at night reading and thinking if this applies to them, keep reading and talking. The rest will come."
i wanna be sober when im high but i wanna be high when im sober :/ 
"Vacation on weed vs vacation w/o weed I am on vacation with my wife right now. Normally I would be stressing about how to bring weed, get it on the flight and enjoy it while I’m there so I could feel “chill”. 

Well let me tell you... this has been the first vacation I have taken without Weed. I am now 35  days sober my friends brought weed but I have resisted and stayed away. And I have felt the most chill that I have ever felt. I am not chasing a feeling, I just feel it I don’t need to smoke to be chill I am just chill. 

Watching my friends smoke weed now is different I feel their pain they are looking to numb with weed, I see they are chasing the same things I chased for years. What you chase with drugs, you will never catch. It is like the chestier rabbit in Alice and wonderland. When you accept yourself, who you are, why you are. life becomes less of a chase and more of an existence. We all exist, that is the common experience. Embrace it and enjoy the fine moments and you will truly live. God bless everyone in this sub."
"My pros list for quitting weed: I’m only on Day 15 but I have no interest in ever partaking again. None! I’ve attempted to quit many times before during my 26 year habit. 26 YEARS, GUYS !!! This time feels truly different, though. My perspective has changed in a profound way. A complete mental paradigm shift has occurred. Unlike previous attempts to quit, I do not feel that I’m losing something in any way. I’ve so much to gain from breaking this chain of addiction and everything to lose by returning to it. May, 22 is not my quit date. IT’S MY START DATE. It’s the start of a happier, healthier, more meaningful and fulfilling life. Quitting (or rather, starting) is the best decision of my life. Here is a list of some things I stand to gain by committing to sobriety.

- A better relationship with my wife
- A better relationship with my kids
- Increased mental clarity 
- Becoming more articulate (no longer embarrassed during intellectual conversations with others)
- improved memory 
- Improved sleep
- Increased energy 
- No longer feeling the shame and guilt that comes with having to hide my drug use from my kids
- More present with my wife and kids
- Increased patience
- Reduced anxiety and depression 
- Increased mental stability 
- No more paranoia
- More self respect
- No more mindless munchies
- Easier to obtain and maintain a healthy body weight (because it’s easier to control my caloric intake) 
- Increased physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual fitness
- Increased lung capacity (no more pain in my throat and chest)
- Better able to cope with stress ( More likely to actually deal with problems and stress instead of just getting high)
- No more treating those around me badly because I’m coming down from THC
- More patience 
- Better physical appearance (no more dark circles under my eyes or embarrassing redness in my eyes)
- Able to confidently look people in the eyes
- increased sex drive and stamina 
- Not having to worry about running out of pot
- Not having to worry about how and where I’ll smoke while on vacation 
- Much more money in my pocket( No longer wasting money on wasting myself) 
- Learning how to enjoy simple pleasures in life without needing to be high
- Improved concentration
- Increased self-confidence (from being able to overcome this insidious drug habit)
- More able to continue with self-improvement in other areas of my life
- More free time to explore other, more healthy activities and hobbies (running, Yoga, meditation, reading, for example)
- Feeling more in touch with a wide range of emotions and moods ( instead of constantly trying in vein to suck “happiness” thru a pipe)
- More able to experience and feel REAL HAPPINESS 
- Performing better at work
- No longer rushing to get away from non-smoking friends and family to get home and smoke 
- Good moods don’t expire as high wears off (Good moods can last all day)
- Always able to respond if necessary when an emergency arises (There’s nothing worse than taking a child to the emergency room stoned out of your mind)
- More able to inspire other people in my life to improve themselves (That feels so good)
- Feeling less apathetic about things
- More able to look at what is actually making me unhappy in life and work to improve myself instead of just lighting up as a temporary  solution to my sadness

I am not providing a cons list for quitting because for me  it doesn’t exist.....

I could go on but I’ll stop there. I hope this helps. Weed is so damn overrated. You all can do this. You really can! You all deserve to have a happier, healthier, more meaningful life. 
Big love, friends. ❤️"
When I smoke all I think about is wanting to quit and when i'm not high all i think about is wanting to smoke 
"I SAID NO Last night I was at my boyfriends house and as they all smoke and I had decided to quit, I knew this was a risk but they are very sweet and I didn’t want to mention it. So after dinner I go upstairs and his family is hitting their little vape thing. This brought me for a ride as I sat there and watched them not wanting to be rude. His dad offers it to me and I said “no thank you” impulsively because I knew that was my new answer. And then I realized what had just happened. For the first time in 5 years, I said no to the thing I have never said no to before. I know I don’t deserve a gold metal or anything but I was really proud and I went to the bathroom and started ugly sobbing  because I could not believe what just happened. Just wanted to share :) still a bit in disbelief honestly but it was bittersweet and then just amazing. Best high I’ve gotten in years is knowing I’m getting better.

Edit: The support on this post has been overwhelmingly amazing. Thank you all so much for your kind words. This subreddit keeps me going! (Also thank you SO MUCH for the awards!!!!!!) ❤️ All the love!

Edit 2: has been an insane journey and I can’t tell you all how my times I cried looking at this post and looking at the responses. You are all amAZING people thank you for the support AND THE FREAKING GOLD OH MY GOD😭😭😭"
"What weed did for me: it lowered every bar. Now that I have some time behind me, I realize that what I liked about smoking is what actually did the most damage to me in the long term -- t lowered every bar.

* It lowered the bar for fun
* It lowered the bar for friends
* It lowered the bar for food
* It lowered the bar for dating
* It lowered the bar for funny

It will take any shitty person, place, or thing and make it feel like a steak dinner.  But it wasn't a steak dinner, I was just living a shitty life and taking a drug to make me okay with it.

Now my life is getting better, and getting better for real.  I'm not sure because it's an unfamiliar feeling, but I think I might actually be happy every once in awhile.

"“We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.” I just wanted to share a quote that’s really helping me stick to my goal of quitting, I’m not usually one for quotes but this really resonated with me. 

I’ve smoked ten years and I know if I keep going I’ll seriously regret it later in life and the fear of that regret is really helping me stay disciplined. Hopefully it can help you guys too!"
"Just smoked after 2 months sober. What I learned Thought about relapsing lately? Your brain convincing you one time won’t hurt/you can moderate/anything of that sort? Lucky for you, I smoked last night after two months and can tell you all about it so you don’t have to. 

Prior to the evening when I smoked, I was browsing this subreddit feverishly looking up “relapse” to see what people’s experiences were (and ultimately trying to convince myself it wouldn’t be so bad, that I could be different, etc). I ended up being so sure that smoking one time wouldn’t completely derail me. I didn’t want to believe people’s accounts of relapsing and having anxiety, binge eating, and feeling shitty the following day. Surprise! It happened to me.

What happened when I smoked: it felt great. At least for the first hour. I got really high and, I won’t lie, I was enjoying myself. But following the first hour was when it went downhill.

I started to feel beyond groggy and slightly anxious. I felt so incapacitated. I noticed some of the old negatives that happened when I used to smoke daily (clenching my jaw, overall bodily discomfort and feeling overwhelmed). I proceeded to eat half a party sized bag of salt and vinegar chips. Yikes. I ended up needing to go to bed because the weed made me so exhausted.

Cue this morning, woke up feeling like a foggy piece of shit. I think I woke up reanimated into an actual zombie. Worst of all, my cravings came back with a vengeance stronger than when I was on my sober streak. Currently I’m feeling some pretty bad cravings that most likely wouldn’t have been as strong if I didn’t smoke last night. My brain is also continuing to convince me I can moderate.

Moral of the story: don’t relapse. I know it sounds simple but I can promise you it isn’t worth it. People’s relapse stories on here are not just them being overly cautious or exaggerating the symptoms. Stay strong and avoid the temptation, it’ll be better in the long run I promise.

Stay strong everyone! You’ve got this! Back to day 1."
"From a daily wake-and-bake stoner to 6 weeks clean: Here’s what I’ve learned So I had been smoking weed semi-regularly for 4 years and daily wake-and-bake smoking for 2 and half. The effects it was having on my health (both physical and mental) my personal life and my career were really starting to show.

I had attempted quitting and moderating several times before but I’d never been able to make it stick.

About 6 weeks ago my boss told me that if my performance didn’t improve at work, he would have to put me on a performance management plan. (Which where I live is basically the first step for firing someone for poor performance).

I work in sales for a tech company that’s on a rocket ship trajectory. I have (a very small amount of) stock in the company, so this job could be my ticket to setting up a really good life for myself, so having that meeting was a real wake up call for me.

Traditionally on my past quitting attempts I had thrown out my weed, my paraphernalia and deleted my dealers number. Inevitably I would have a panic attack and put myself through the indignity of rummaging through the trash to grab my bong back (or waste money on a brand new one) and get my dealers number back from someone and go into an even worse binge.

This time I kept my bong exactly where it always sits, I still have my lighter, grinder and everything else with me, I still have my dealers number. For me personally there was something about the psychology of “I can smoke if I want to, but I’m choosing not to” that really worked for me.

In addition to that, I had seen some advice to not think of quitting as “I’m quitting weed forever” but just to wake up every day and say “not today, I’m not smoking today” that also was really successful for me.

Initially I only intended on going on a break, but having noticed how much my sleep, my work performance, my social life (as much as you can have one in a covid world) and everything else had improved that now I think I’ve given up weed for good.

There is a lot of advice out there for quitting weed, don’t be afraid to try different techniques and strategies even if they might not be what the majority considers the right approach.

TL:DR - I tried and failed to quit a number of times before by following the traditional quitting advice, but then I switched it up, kept all my weed stuff and adopted a one-day-at-a-time, “not today” mentality rather than “I’m quitting for the rest of my life” that was really successful for me"
"After quiting I realized the reason why every single one of my friends smoke Every friend that I know who smokes each has a sad reason behind it. When we were all smoking together you don't think about this, you're simply having fun, feeling great when you're high. 

After I stopped I quickly realized each one my friend has a traumatic reason behind their addiction.. 
I did as well and I'm glad I'm on the path to recovery. 
It's just sad knowing deep down your friends aren't doing well and are actually hurt, even if they don't show it. Childhood friends who you used to hang out sober with more than half of your lives as kids are now in this sad position in their lives, facing this terrible addiction.

I hope they soon realize they also have the power to take control of their lives."
"Weed is a trap Weed won't kill you but it will kill who you could be. It's easy to forget that emotions we become some numb to are feedback. They tell us when we are uncomfortable and they push us to overcome whatever situation we are in. Weed makes us comfortable with being uncomfortable. That shit job you are stuck in? Don't worry about it. You can smoke and chill out right after your shift is done.That huge test you are studying for? You're really stressed out. Maybe a little toke will make you more focused.


All weed really does is freeze you in time. The world will keep spinning and your peers will progress through life while you live the same day in a smoke filled haze. Isn't it better to feel emotions? Isn't it better to cherish the boredom you feel that motivates you to pick up a guitar, go to the gym, or otherwise be productive? Think about all you could've accomplished if so much time and money weren't spent on a disassociating from the real you.


Weed is the most dangerous drug in the world because of how safe it is. It takes the potential of all that you could ever be and makes you content with what you are. It's sad to think I've felt much more human and alive these past few weeks than I have these past few years of daily smoking. I'm angry that I've let myself be okay with a mediocre life but I'm putting everything I can into changing that. 


Stay off the weed, if you fall off the wagon get right back on it. There's much more to life than getting high!

"How my eyes have changed since quitting I've always found progress pics really motivational and I was looking for a way to include that in my quit, so I took photos of my eyes. 

To me, there's something almost eerily different about them now, between day 2 and day 42. There's the obvious parts: the skin around them is less purple and sunken, the whites are much whiter, they've lost that permanent glossy haze. But there's just something else that really made me want to share. 

[My eyes on day 2 vs. day 42](http://imgur.com/gallery/YxbJ2iC)

I've never felt more proud of myself than I have looking at this picture. It sounds lame, but it almost looks like there's more soul in them.

Maybe it's just me seeing it, knowing how much of myself I've gotten back. Maybe it's the lighting. Maybe there's some science behind it. Maybe it's just hope. 

Whatever it is, I know I made the right choice, and I'll keep making that choice every day.

Edit: The top photo is a tad less focused than the bottom, but I still see huge differences. For anyone wanting to do their own eyeball progress pics, definitely double check that it's focused right on the iris!

Edit 2: Thanks so much for the silver and the kind comments! And as another disclaimer, I know these pictutes are not exact. I did everything I could, but there are differences in the lighting and sharpness. I saw the biggest difference in how it felt to make eye contact with each. The top picture is of a dead-eyed stoner. The bottom picture is of me."
"This single idea changed my whole mindset on marijuana and helped me quit for good. When trying to quit, I had such a negative connotation on weed. I thought it was the biggest issue in my life. If I solved this issue, everything would be okay. I was in a constant loop of relapsing for 2 years straight. I hated marijuana, yet I kept using daily. I finally discovered that weed wasn’t my problem. It was my solution. I used this compound to try and solve the other problems in my life. But weed doesn’t solve anything, it just numbs the pain. Once I changed my perspective, something clicked in my head. Weed wasn’t ruining my life. I was ruining my life. Maybe there are more people who need to hear this, weed isn’t your problem. It’s your solution. Once I found alternative solutions to my actual problems, I was able to quit."
"I get it now. I didn't smoke weed this weekend. 

Time moved slower. 
I tried a new restaurant. 
I painted on my back porch. 
I went for a run. 
I ate a normal amount of food.
I woke up feeling rested. 
I walked through my neighborhood.
I called my grandma.
I meal prepped for the week.
I actually watched a movie.
I checked in with some friends.
I finished a ton errands before 10am.
I had an actual dream.

Part of me missed the high. Craved it. 

Regardless, this is pretty cool. I get it now."
"Saw this on my buddy's flash sheet, and had to have it. Here's to never being a stoner again. RIP to lesser days. "
"Y'know what's so great about being sober? You can just do whatever tf you want Man I cannot tell you how many times I've had to skirt around making plans, cancel plans, or just never do anything because it would take several days to figure out how to time getting high enough to do stuff with being not so high that I couldn't do stuff but also not so sober I didn't wanna do anything and only for as long as that small window of time between them or else I'd be stuck out needing to get high or getting high and being too high to keep doing the thing. Such a shitty cycle that just kept me basically stuck in my room and made my whole world so unbelievably small.

But I'm sober now. I spontaneously caught up with an old friend the other day, it was great. I spoke to another friend I haven't seen for a while and I was able to genuinely say 'let me know when you're free and we'll catch up' and mean it. Bought a nice new bike on a whim, and actually ride it, whenever I feel like. I chilled out with my housemate and his friend tonight just casually. I enquired about a tattoo booking now the studios are opening back up and I was able to take the appointment offered to me without having to think about it. The next day one of my besties is coming around with her daughter and new bf for lunch at my place and I'm actually excited about it, not trying to tetris in being able to even do it and dreading interactions with some guy I don't know and a teenager. Then I lined up a date with a really cool seeming guy for lunchtime the next day at a café I like in town. 

That's a whole weekend line-up, just like a NORMAL person, just living life. Haven't been able to just do shit like that for so long it's honestly like 'oh that's something other people get to do, not me'. But screw that, I DO get to hang out with with mates and make appointments and go on dates and eat at cafés and buy myself nice things and live my goddamn life. Weed was like a prison. A warm, heavy, comfortable prison. I'm glad to be out of prison finally."
"Hello all, it’s my birthday!! This is my 3rd birthday that I will be sober.🎉🎂🎈🎈 "
"haven't smoked in a week and the change was immediate (20f) Let me start by saying that I believe marijuana is a transformative plant- smoking it can bring out the best in a person, or it can bring out the worst- and sometimes, it flips. Sometimes it can bring you a great burst of creativity... other times you're locked in your room, shaking under your sheets. I started smoking socially, and at first, what a world!! Weed made everything... *better*. It was something to do with my friends when we went hiking, or to the beach, or to watch a movie. Weed was a welcome accompaniment to any and all activities, hell, sometimes that *was* the only activity- we would just sit around, smoke, and shoot the shit. It was a great conversation starter, as just about everyone smokes nowadays. Smoking weed was a way to escape from my thoughts and enjoy everything around me.

But at some point over the last 2 years, that changed. My first semester of college is where things took a nose-dive. I was 18, a fresh lil baby who had never been away from home for more than a month, and I fell into the wrong crowd almost immediately. At first, we would take all sorts of precautions, like using a Smoke Buddy, blowing out the window, etc, until we were smoking big ass blunts in the bathroom without covering the vents. All we would do was toke, and I would go to class reeking to high heaven, not retaining a single thing. Eventually it got to the point that we all stopped going to class because it interfered with us getting high. The apartment that we all lived at (some rent-free) became sticky, like the ground was covered in tar. Leaving wasn't exactly terrifying, but it was *really* unpleasant. Anytime I did leave, all I could think about was getting back as soon as possible to smoke with my ""friends"". I didn't want to, no, I couldn't leave, because what if I missed out on something? What if T did something hilarious or a great conversation happened and I wasn't there to add my brainless contribution? Even worse, what if they were talking shit about me? And where was I, at the dining halls or in class? Nothing was more important than being there, every minute, everyday- not personal time to recenter myself, not class, certainly not food. I may be one of the few folks who got the reverse Freshman 15.

After... further *bad* experiences winter break that I won't go into, I finally went home and realized that I was too immature for it all. Being on your own required a level of strength that I didn't yet have, even if the university is holding your hand on the journey to independence.  I pulled out of the main campus, and enrolled in the regional campuses- commuting from home, I was going to classes and doing well for myself, safe back in the nest. But I was still smoking.

I had to smoke to do anything. Cleaning my cat's litter box? Better spark up first. Going to work? Just a little hit. What a day, I just want to smoke and pass out in front of How I Met Your Mother, or Love After Lock-Up, or any other mindless sitcom that would allow me to consume, consume, consume, no thoughts required. I binged so much reality television that my speech patterns would mimic whatever stupid show I was watching at the time. My social skills went down the toilet because I was always high- I started stuttering, my brain would ""hitch"" (my term for not being able to think properly), my anxiety sky-rocketed as my depression spiraled. Instead of getting out of my head, weed forced me in deeper, at gun-point. I would be nearly comatose on my bed with a head that felt like it was full of wasps. I am an incredibly visual person, and weed would bring me 4K HD visions, crystal fucking clear, of past humiliations, of future possibilities that would always veer towards negativity, of my present pimply, yellow-toothed self (because of all of the shit food I would eat and how my skin and teeth reacts to smoke). But despite every negative effect it gave me, despite how it cemented me and made me stagnate, I couldn't stop. Something about the brain buzz that I both loved and feared.

But one day, high as usual, I went into the bathroom to look at myself. The familiar rush of self-loathing filled me but there was something else this time. It was the strongest desire to change everything about me, including the environment surrounding me. More than anything, I wanted to be the best version of myself living far, far away. Away from my childhood room and the rut I stuck myself in: being independent, living my best life, and most importantly, not dependent on a substance to get me through the day, a substance that was inexplicably tied to the trauma I had endured 2 years ago and was reliving every time I picked up the bong. I wish I could say that then was when I stopped smoking (I continued to use for weeks after this epiphany), but I made a goal- I would move out by the beginning of August, and no matter what, I would never smoke weed at my new place. 

It's been a week since I moved in, and I kept my word, and the change was instantaneous. My brain fog cleared up, I no longer stutter, or struggle as hard finding the right words, my anxiety is considerably lower, I'm very social with my roommates- and though I still feel sad, it's not the intense waves of depression that almost drowned me. My teeth have even lightened a few shades and my acne is calming down. With this change of habit, some new habits have formed as well. I'm cooking instead of eating fast food, keeping up with my hygiene, I make it a point to be more neat and organized. The only change that I still need to make is implementing a work-out routine and being less sedentary, but despite it all, I'm working everyday to be the best version of myself. About damn time."
"Four days in and my GF said she sees the man she fell in love with again. Some context for my journey. I gave up weed eight years ago and after a fairly traumatic breakup earlier in the year I began smoking again. During that time I met an amazing woman and the first three months of our relationship were carefree and fun but the past little bit I’ve let myself fall down the rabbit hole of smoking almost an ounce a fortnight. It’s made me anxious, jealous and I haven’t performed professionally. I had to recognise the impact and give myself space again. I now realise I sadly can’t have a casual relationship with weed and I need to stop. So instead of spending my money on an ounce I took my GF for dinner at a fancy Italian place and we laughed more than we have for a long time and enjoyed a bottle of red wine. I feel more in control of my emotions and decisions than I have in months and I can’t think of a life in which weed plays a role. I’m proud of myself and so motivated that this time it will stick no matter what life throws at me. I’m posting here to keep myself accountable and make sure I stick to it because this is my true self not the lie weed told me I was."
"I tried to kill myself last night I made a throwaway account to share my feelings cause im ashamed of myself. I smoked weed for 10 years each day about 1-1.5gr a day. Tried to stop several times but it got me in its control. I feel like i am in prison trapped in my own body to stand up each day and smoke and do nothing. Watching myself in the mirror everyday seeing myself getting worse everyday. Last night i just wanted to give up. I went outside and didnt take anything with me. Drove to the nearest high bridge and i stood there on the edge for maybe 30 minutes before someone stopped and pulled me away. I couldnt stop crying for 4 hours and my life is so miserable. Lost both of my parents when i was 5, no brothers or sisters and i got 0 friends. I have/had? a wife and a 2 yo daughter and i cant even look them in the eyes without losing my mind and crying. What am i doing to myself I lost everything. Its not worth it anymore. I dont know how i can ever stop this. I didnt smoke untill what happened yesterday and i truly believe that stop smoking will help and will do less damage than continuing smoking."

"Weed free for 100 days, decided to smoke again. What I have learned. I was free from weed for a 100 days before I decided to try it out again. Bought a gram and spent 2-3 days smoking it. I'm out now and what I have noticed is that I am craving it again. I was craving it as well while I was quitting, but comparing that crave to the current one, this one is way harder. I thought the cravings I was having after a 100 days were tough, but in reality they were easy. I definitely do feel better when I lay off the weed, so I am taking this as a lesson learned and whenever I feel the need to smoke again, I will remember that fighting the urge after being off of it for a while is easier than just ""doing it one time"" and then fighting off that crave.

Thanks for reading."
Nice 
"Weed makes pleasure too simple. Being able to smoke and immediately get pleasure ultimately fucks your brain’s reward system. You need to get pleasure from complex events in your life rather than smoking a plant. I felt disassociated from everything around me when I was smoking every day.
Now I see why. My brain didn’t *need* to be in touch with events around me to have a good time. This is short term happiness that gets old eventually. Sustained happiness can not be that simple.

Appreciate what’s around you. Quitting is going to be fucking rough. This hardship doesn’t mean your mind is ruined by any means. Your mind needs time to adapt without daily weed and to learn how to reward you accordingly. Let your mind get used to getting high on your own life and the events that are happening to you. 

Soon enough, you’ll feel better than you can ever remember feeling."
"If you quit you will be 5 months sobber on 25th December, and give yourself a proper Christmas present 5 months from now will be Christmas. Give yoursrlfa present today"
"If you ever feel alone in this, just remember that if all of us on r/leaves got together in one place this is how we would look. Everyone is here to help you, and we all want to hear your story. "
"We are all more similar than different, for example. How many of us would smoke through a bag as fast a possible, because, that was going to be the last bag ever. Only to buy one the next day and do the same fucking thing. I did "
"You guys said it would get easier - it did. Everyone is this community says to keep holding on. 

I trusted you.

And it did get easier.

Thank you"
First month sober from weed in 20 yrs!!!! 
"Friday evening in a lockdown, a stoner roommate, a new vape, intense cravings, headaches, insomnia, the bloating, hopelessness. Yet I won't cave in. Friday Evening -- let it approach.
Stoner Roommate -- let him smoke.
The cravings returning -- let them return.
A headache -- it wont kill me.
Hopeless feelings of impending doom -- its just the mind that's afraid, I am here, everything is fine.
Stomach ache -- Good for me, will help hit abs faster.
Insomnia -- let sleep come when it will.

Bring it on addict brain, bring it on. Today I sit and stare right in your eyes, unmoving, unrelenting.
I am not craving weed you are, I am not these thoughts, its you. Today, we dont even fight, I just ignore you completely like a wailing stupid kid that wants to play with fire.

I win back my life today."
"High Me Vs Sober Me -High Me wakes up tired after 8 hours of sleep.
Sober Me wakes up well rested after 7 hours of sleep.

-High Me stops at McDonalds before work to get a quick breakfast.
Sober Me prepares a healthy sandwich and fruit to take for breakfast.

-High Me hates his job and counts every minute until he can go home and smoke.
Sober Me feels fulfilled and competent during work and is engaged in his goals.

-High Me gets home with more fast food to eat after getting high.
Sober Me gets home and goes on a run, then makes a healthy plate of chicken rice and vegetables.

-High Me goes straight on the computer to play games with toxic communities.
Sober Me practices guitar and tries to master that song that’s been bugging him.

-High Me goes to sleep wondering when life will get better.
Sober Me goes to sleep planning the next day and what he needs to do to make his life better.

I don’t know about you, but I wouldn’t trade Sober Me for the world. My friends, wake up! You don’t hate your friends, you don’t hate your job, you don’t hate yourself, you don’t hate your life! You only hate the mindset you’re in everyday because you continue to use THC. Stay strong and stay positive! Sober You is waiting...

EDIT: Hello everyone, I’d like to address something for a select few people who have a different opinion than I. This subreddit is about addiction, it’s for people (like myself) who have finally come to terms that they cannot use THC moderately, responsibly, casually, healthily, however you’d like to put it. It affects us negatively, it’s hurt us or held us back in one way or another. I’m not trying to say that the plant itself has no benefits, I actually believe in the benefits of CBD, but that’s a whole different story for a whole different subreddit. (My opinion): THC and I are NOT compatible,  I can’t form a healthy relationship with it and I feel like a better version of myself without it. If you can live a healthy lifestyle and still use THC in moderation, or you feel it helps you become more creative in your own right, then this post/subreddit may not be for you. Thank you for sharing your opinion, and I’m glad THC hasn’t had the effect it’s had on me and many others here."
"I used to be like, “Damn, how does everyone find time to clean their apartment and have energy to take care of all of their normal adult things?” And then I stopped smoking weed 😆 What a game changer! 24 days in. Some days have been rough, but overall, I can’t get over how much better I feel. I’ve accomplished more in the past 24 days than I have in like, the past 5 years. I’m so excited to hit my one month mark! And for the record, I started smoking when I was 13, daily since I was 23, and I’m 30. You can DEFINITELY do this and you WILL feel better! Keep on keepin on, Leaves!"
"Smoked a joint yesterday after 5 months I wanted to share my experience smoking yesterday. Because it was not at all how i expected it to be. First a little back story: 

Been completely clean for 5 months, having amazing days and terrible ones. I guess how the life of a human being should be. Initially it was tough, the first 2 weeks i craved all the fucking time. Read a lot of good tips here, and i think as many of you i now had to meet my problems head on instead of smoking them away. Once that initial period was over, i felt amazing. I did so many good things for myself, like eating healthy, exercising, meditating, got my sleep schedule back on track etc. Applied for a masters program, trying to move my life forward.

As time went by, the effect of these good actions diminished, or atleast it felt like it. Objectively the value they carry did not, ofc. Exercising is just as good (if not better) for you when you feel shit as when you feel great. But over time my habits slipped, and i went back to behaviour i associate with smoking, like binge watching TV, youtube, sleeping for a long time, eating junk. Basically a lot of distractions and short-term gratification. My problems were not gone, and i was tired of fighting. This happened around 3 month mark and just grew in my mind. 

I saw myself diminish, and with these behaviours i once again found myself craving for a smoke. Like a lot. I even bought some other herbs (non-psychoactive) to help, but all that did was reminding myself of earlier times, almost glorifying the days i smoked weed. 

So, yesterday i met up with a friend group i used to smoke a lot with. We started toghetter like 8 years ago and had that habit as an anchor in our friendship. One of them had some weed, and rolled one up and sparked it. Im actually amazed at how easy i accepted, but it didnt seem like the biggest of deals. I think subconsciously i had been waiting for this moment, and had already accepted i was gonna smoke. After all, i had gone 5 months without, and i was craving a lot. Just one as a prize for all the hard work, right? Even though i know that life is better without it, i had proven that to myself. Which of course was the real reward of those 5 months, and the joy that accompanied the fact that i made it through. For a time i forgot that pride i had in that accomplishment. 

To the moral of the story: the experience actually turned out great - not because it was so great smoking, it was not (got anxious, my mind felt blurred, was lethargic etc) - but because that right there showed me what a fucking waste of my life smoking is. It really solidified the fact that i dont want to smoke, there were reasons i quit. It showed me that it was not at all how i fantasized it to be, my glorification of it was so off it was hilarious. 

Im not beating myself up over it, instead choosing to be grateful for my 5 months and with new spirit regarding the future. I will not smoke. Maybe i needed a reminder to continue on my sober journey. Thanks to all of you for printing this idea in my mind, that 1 slip up does not equal full blown relapse. My progress is not gone, all the work i did is still valid. And even though my problems are not gone, at least i can say i tried really hard at resolving them, and that's what I'm gonna continue doing. This perspective was lost on me yesterday, but i found it again. 

Sorry for the long post, I hope someone maybe can relate to some of it and can get something out of my experience. To all the people going strong - keep going. Let my slip up prove to you that it isnt worth it, you dont need to smoke. Your reasons for quitting were real, and still are. It truly is not worth it. Take care of yourself, love yourself - not a fucking plant.

TLDR; Was 5 months sober. Smoked a joint. It sucked. Got a nice realization out of the experience. Motivated to continue on my sober journey. Remember the reasons you quit. Love yourself, never forget that you deserve a happy life without addiction, and that its possible. Work is required, but its really worth it."
"R/leaves is a recommended community Woke up one day and realized all of my problems are stemming from weed. I didn’t google it, or Reddit it, but I started talking to my friends about it. They were all trying to convince me not to quit for the rest of the day. Some had pretty good arguments and I was starting to think weed wasn’t the problem. I was about to go smoke with my friends when I got a notification on my phone, “r/leaves is a recommended community”. It truly stopped me in my tracks. I was minutes away from smoking. I didn’t know what to think, was this just a coincidence? Is this my phone listening to my conversations? Or is this really a sign? Being skeptical, I opened up the subreddit and the first post I saw addressed my exact situation with my mental health and was just spot on. I haven’t smoked in a week since then and I think it might be truly over for me. Thank you guys."
"Today we celebrated my moms 68th birthday.. I didn’t smoke before she opened presents. I didn’t sit there wishing she’d skip the cards so we could be done sooner and I could go smoke, or lay in my bed high. I even bought her a present worth $75 - the most I have ever spent on a gift for one of my parents. I didn’t choose the card that was 2.99 vs 8.99 because I knew I’d need that extra $6 later to pick up or for gas. I didn’t think twice about her hugging me - or having to do my ritual of lotion, perfume and eye drops before coming downstairs..

All this is new for me since quitting 66 days ago. I never had money. I never wanted to be around my family for more than 10 minutes. But today, I was 100% sober, present and truly happy with them as we celebrated my moms 68th year of life... she even cried while reading the card I bought her (worth the 9 bucks, haha)!

I can honestly, full heartedly say that quitting is the best decision I have made in years. 

Leave the weed behind. Take advantage of the time you have with what (and who) is important in your life. 

Have a good day everyone!

Edit: MY FIRST GOLD!? Woohoo! Thank you so much guys. This sub has been a huge help in regards to my sobriety. I didn’t expect this type of feedback at all. I’m sooo happy it reached the hearts of so many people. Today was a great day. Like many of you have said, “no looking back”. Blessings to all of you on your journey. Good luck!"
"I quit smoking on a Wednesday, I post this image on my insta every week to track my progress. Every line is a week. Thanks guys! "
"55 days clean. First 420 sober after 7 years, ty r/leaves for the tips and advice "
"8 years stoned, took six months to quit. But it's day 50! Some of the things that helped: It's been 50 days since 420.

After six months of actively trying to quit and failing- daily, weekly, continuously...here we are. I had been smoking daily for about 8 years and had previously been an alcoholic.

**Things that helped me:**

* Routine! (Plan your day the night before. Know what you'll do the next day as soon as you wake up.)
* One. Day. At. A . Time.
* Each day begins with meditation and Wim Hof breathing.
* Each day ends with some light yoga/zen time, thank yourself for persevering towards sobriety and making yourself a better human.
* Learn about the dopamine system and how your behavior is wired. Knowing what is going on in your head may provide answers and then you can implement solutions.
* Get the f%$k off social media and the news. That garbage is designed to trigger negative emotions and hook you. Social media lowers your self worth, distracts you from the present, and is designed to give you dopamine releases (the same system you're currently trying to fix by not smoking).

This journey was one I took alone... isolated due to covid. Maybe that helped because I wasn't around any old smoke buddies. If you have a good friend or family group, stay connected. We're deeply wired for human connection.

The first 2-3 weeks may have been the most psychologically challenging minutes and days of my life..I wasn't sure I'd make it through. Hell, I wasn't sure of anything. I was going minute to minute at times.

But here at day 50- it's hard to describe what life can be like until you break through. All I can say is that not smoking changed me in so many ways- ALL for the better.

Whoever you are and whatever your story is, always believe that you can change. All the love, all the power.

**Tldr: Things that helped me quit:** routine, meditation, yoga, quit social media, learn about dopamine system, keep believing in yourself.

**Edit- Thank you for the gold! I'm not sure what to do with it, but it's shiny and it was kind of you.** 

**Edit- It's been really great chatting with everyone today, I was a lurker on here for months and the support we give each other is what will pull us through.**"
The only fatty I’m rolling these days. After 100 days I can breath well again. Lungs recover quick after hard efforts. Such a good feeling to not be wheezing and struggling to recover. 
Took me over 10 years to reach Today. Almost 1 month! 
Anyone notice how fast your life moves when you smoke everyday? Once you stop you regain clarity and life moves slower and it feels better in the long run. No more going through the motions. 
"Without weed 1. I can express myself more articulately 
2. I automatically improve and take more care in maintaining my physical health and hygiene 
3. I have larger and more rewarding goals
4. I learn to experience and regulate my own emotions
5. I have one less thing to be shameful about
6. I have more time in the day
7. I learn to practice discipline and prioritize the long term over the short term 
8. I explore
9. I grow to leave behind a tough and rewarding chapter of my life - one where I learn how detrimental addiction can be, how it can debilitate and warp your thought patterns, and finally how to overcome it, how to separate my negative thoughts from myself and actively CHOOSE to prioritize myself

I will not fool myself. I am resilient."
"Last night I read a note I wrote myself in 2013 when I was 23. I wrote how I didn't want to smoke because it held me back and what I wanted to accomplish after I stop smoking. It's 2020 and I'm 29. 7 years went by just like that. Time is the ultimate currency [Day 9] I have had my ups and downs with weed. Mostly downs. I've got through clean periods then relapsed. Weed for me just jived with my personality. I like to distance myself and isolate myself so it's the perfect solo drug. I have abused it so bad over the last couple of years and it has held me the fuck back. Reading that note from 2013 made me so sad. That was 7 fucking years ago. I am dealing with the SAME issues as 7 years ago. Seven motherfucking years....

I have been feeling so depressed since I quit 9 days ago. I feel like this is it guys, I cannot go back. I'm turning 30 in 2 months. I cannot smoke daily again. It has fucked me and stifled my growth. I am tired of doing this over and over again and posting on this sub over and over and over again. How many times? This is it for me. 

Try and think about quitting as a life altering moment. For me, I entered a new phase of my life 9 days ago and it's that simple. I literally CANNOT go back. If I do, my depression will worsen and I'm scared I will fall down a black hole and could have irreversible repercussions. 

It's not about weed, it's about escaping issues and things that aren't easy in life. Weed is just the vehicle to do it. It could have been alcohol or food or sex or something. Not being sober is not a way to live. 

**Just think about how much time has been wasted. Let that sit for a minute. Think about it. Think about how much older you have become. Think about how the decade of 2010 - 2020 is done. 10 years just like that. Time goes by so quick. It's time to take your life more seriously. No one gives a shit about you, except you. No one can do anything for you, except you.**"
"i (26F) had previously posted that i couldn’t make it through 1 day sober. TODAY I DID IT 24hrs DOWN! the last straw was me falling out multiple times. i take 6 meds for mental disorders and i’ve irresponsibly disregarded the consequences of mixing with weed. the last few weeks i’ve been lightheaded when i stand up and have even collapsed a few times.

sounds crazy but i loved the feeling of fainting. the complete loss of control of my body and then hitting the ground was euphoric to me. but i realized one day i might not get back up.

one day without weed down. never quit quitting!

EDIT: WOAH THANKS FOR THE SHINY! 
• this community is so supportive thanks so much. i’ve been a longtime lurker but now will definitely be more interactive in here. feel free to PM me."
"23 days without it, and I already replace that habit for cycling. I don't think smoking mj is a good or bad habit. Is just I could not regulate it, so the abuse was not helping me to achieve some things that I wanted. I have been reading this subreddit since day 1 and that encourage me to leave it "
"Earned vs unearned dopamine This is what it seems to boil down to. When I smoke, play videogames, watch porn etc, I did not earn that dopamine. These things ruin me because I get rewarded for doing nothing. Eventually my dopamine receptors get numb, nothing feels good anymore but I can't stop doing it. I become weak, pathetic, nervous, unnaturally introverted and reclusive. I enter into a nasty negative feedback loop and it becomes that much harder to do something productive. When I'm stoned, I almost never clean, and when I do, it's the bare minimum to avoid disgust. I never invited anyone over because I was too ashamed and too lazy to clean. When I'm sober, I take pride in cleaning. I listen to music and clean my apartment like I'm creating art. I want it to look beautiful, I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish, I get that dopamine and I feel good about it. My environment is clean because my mind is clean and vice versa. I feel healthy, because rather than giving in to the munchies and buying fast food, I cook healthy, tasty and delicious food which nourishes me.

When I discipline myself to earn my pleasure, it becomes productive rather than destructive.

These are the things that helped me get to where I am now:

1. Meditation.
This helps me with withdrawals and mood swings. It gives me the peace and calm that I used to try to get from weed. It also unlocked some of my dormant power and I felt my consciousness expand.

2. Exercise.
I needed to burn the excess energy and release endorphins, this is especially vital for me early on when I'm having withdrawals and raging. I choose exercise which I enjoy - MMA and rock climbing. I don't need discipline to do these things because I enjoy them. I want to take advantage of my youth because one day I'll be old. So I want to use my body the way it was designed, heal my lungs and feel strong. Yoga is also great for me because it checks both exercise and meditation.

3. Clean eating.
All the sugar and bad fats are a drug in and of themselves. I didn't earn that fast food or that sugar hit that just has me feeling awful and anxious afterwards. Learning to cook some basic, healthy, tasty meals was a great investment for me. It helped me with emotional stability and feeling good all the time.

4. Clean room.
A clean room, for me, means a clean mind. I've noticed that broke, addicted, wretched people live in filth. But when I'm proud of my apartment, I feel proud, like a King. I want to be clean so that I resonate with my environment. I've learned why they say that ""cleanliness is next to godliness.""

5. Social distancing.
From the people who encouraged me to remain a loser. I spend more time around people who want the best for me. Those who don't like me smoking. I used to have no one, but being sober allowed me to get out there and meet people through engaging in some hobbies. Being sober also allowed me to find hobbies outside of staying home and gaming.

6. Video games.
I used to zone out for hours at a time every day, losing my self in the digital world. In terms of its effects on the brain, video game addiction is not that different to weed addiction IMO. There are better things to do with my valuable free time that don't encourage my need for escapism. Time lost on games gives me very little if any return on investment. I'm happier in the long run when I'm doing more productive things.

7. I read 'Quitting weed: The complete guide' by Matthew Clarke.
I read a few books like this, but they were so cringe I continued to smoke. This one really is the complete guide and it helped program my brain to see my predicament for what it is.
 
8. Sexual discipline.
Porn? I didn't earn that woman. Masturbation? I didn't earn that orgasm. Undressing a woman with my eyes? I didn't earn the right to see her naked. Lost in a sexual fantasy? I never earned the right to have sex with her. If I can keep my mind clean, it's a lot easier to retain my seed. There's a reason why almost all cultures (until recently) and religions stress sexual discipline. I believe we've lost sight of that. Now I don't know about women, but IMO, for men, this might be the single greatest life hack. It has been for me at least. All good habits can follow on from this one. The power and gravitas I develop has me feeling like a super hero, and women become very drawn to me. People respect and admire me a lot more when I've been retaining, and everything seems to get better. It's strange how powerful this practice can be for a lot of the men who try it.

I wish you all the best. I'm here for you anytime if you need support."
"Why am I still here? A person dm me and asked me why am I still on this sub. He said you’ve been clean for over 2 years, you shouldn’t need as much support as other who are just starting this journey.  My response was this.

I know how hard it is to to end this habit. I know how difficult it is when you’re beginning to go through of remaining clean. I know how stressful it is dealing with withdrawals. Why not lend help to others? This sub has been supportive to me during my early journey. Why not give back? Also just because I may up the road a bit doesn’t mean I can’t use the support. I smoked for 25 freaking years. Two years clean is a great accomplishment but I’m still healing I’m still in recovery. Although my paws wave symptoms are spreading further and further apart by the months, I still experience them . 25 years a dam long time. Weed was my wife, my girlfriend my everything. So I understand the 
struggle.
So I say guys continue to get all the support from this sub as you can. Support is needed more now than ever. Everyone here knows the struggle and can provide the strength to keep you moving ahead. Good luck to you all."
"I haven’t smoked in 49 days and I’m starting to do things I never thought or cared about in years Like the simple task of flossing your teeth. My gums were bleeding so bad and inflamed but I’ve been flossing everyday and they’re starting to get better.

Keeping up with doing laundry and sanitizing my bathroom and room, just maintaining it to keep it clean.

In tune to my thoughts and feelings, not masking it by getting high all day.

Pursuing my goals that I never thought twice about doing. Going to get trained/certified to be a pharm tech through this program. I wouldn’t have been able to do this had I not quit for good.

My overall self and wellbeing. I’m caring for myself more. I’m doing things that my future self will thank me for. I’ve tried quitting in the past but wasn’t serious about it. I’ve had this mental switch that it’s over with, time to grow up, be responsible and move the fuck on. I’m not letting this plant hold me down and it’s a beautiful thing to be and feel strong this time."
"Day 59 without Nicotine & Day 26 without Weed. Adapting to good habits like reading books, meditating and cooking on a regular basis. Life has never been better. Thank you all for sharing motivational stories. Really helps a lot to keep my game going strong! ⭐️ "
"I Thought Smoking Made Me A ‘Chilled Out’ Person. It Actually Made Me Irritable, Anxious and a Bit of a Dick  **6 weeks** sober today.

I have a lot more patience for things and people in my life. 

I am now able to open up to them and actually express how I feel about things. This makes me overall happier and a better person to be around.

This has improved my relationships with close friends and my parents in particular.

Smoking clouded my mind and stopped me processing things which would build up inside me until they would blow up one day. 

Clearing that fog has let me identify other problems in my life which I now have the courage to own up to and fix after smoking daily for 15 years.

Best of luck to everyone else going through the same thing at the moment.

The journey so far has been well worth it and I am looking forward to pushing on even further and thanks for all of the support!"
"Day 117 no pot, Day 201 no wine, Go me!!!!!!!!!!!!! I read that at 10-12 months,  the benefits of sobriety start compounding.  I'm almost 7 months off the wine and 4 months off the pot/gummies, and 5 1/3 years off the cigs.  The benefits are lining up.  I am dreaming next of getting my muscle tone and flexibility back.  I am dreaming of focusing hard everyday and working the whole day prospecting and managing my book, and then stopping with a guilt free conscious because I did what I promised myself was required to do for success.  I want that compounding baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also, I have just started listening to my NLP programs again.  I was doing that last year and people were telling me that I seemed like a different person.  Really fabulous attitude and calm and happy.  I want more of that.  There is no downside people.  Seize the day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Time to score in life.  Fuck the alcohol and cigs and pot.  They all suck the life out of people and ruin relationships and cost a fortune.  We got this!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Edit:  Wow, 442 upvotes.  Typically I never pay attention.  Feels good to share the success and cheer you on!"
In a few days I hit the one year mark after a 46 year addiction. Yep I did it! I could not be prouder and happier. Living without weed is great. Being an addict really sucks. Regrets exist. They sometimes weigh me down. Mostly though I am too busy making up for lost time by living my life facing things rather than avoiding them. It baffles me that I used for so long. If you’re reading this and you are thinking you have a problem with weed you likely do. Give yourself a day off and you may just choose not to go back.
"One year free of weed. I am Transformed. Today is my one year anniversary clean of weed. I can say the benefits of weed free living are so much better than the temporary joy of getting high. I made space to receive lessons and blessings from the universe, and I am clear enough to be the master of my reality instead of someone who is consistently out of alignment. I no longer need to seek relief from substance. I can create my own relief. I have learned how to harness my own inherent power and I couldn’t describe the impact of that on my life. I faced challenges and traumas and made it my mission to rely on myself for my healing and love. It wasn’t easy but my mental state is so solid right now. I am living in pure contentment. 

Don’t ever give up on yourself or that dream of being clean. anything you believe is already real and all you desire is already yours."
"5 years clean today!🎉 So today marks five years clean from weed!

The best advice I can give is, it DOES get easier! I can't stand being around it now and don't get tempted at all. 

I used to be going through a good 2-3 grams a day, everyday. I struggled pretty bad to not have it. The first year was difficult but after time went on I realised I stopped counting the minutes/hours/days and started forgetting about it.

When I could smell it, I would get a physical yearning for it and now it's a repulsion. 

This is a big deal for me and I'm so proud of myself to be where I am today."
"I am one year sober today. I’m 34 and this is the longest I’ve been sober since starting smoking at 16. 

It is a constant choice to remain sober. I live in a state where it’s legal and know how easy it would be to stop by a dispensary or call for a delivery. I still crave it and still miss it. But I accept that it’s no longer a part of my life. 

In the last year, I feel like I’ve finally grown up. I’m more comfortable with myself as a person, feel less daily anxiety, less mood swings. I changed my career, got into wicked good shape and donated a kidney to a family member. 

Giving up weed was a sacrifice but the rewards are amazing and worth the daily struggle. I am feeling a lot of quiet pride today. It’s neat.

Edit: whoever gilded this- thanks from the bottom of my soul. Today is meaningful."
"Do you guys ever relapse and after the first few puffs....a few minutes into it, you realise, Huh, this is why I decided to quit. Share your experiences."
Me and a friend making progress quitting 
"‘Weed takes you out of awareness of the present moment, then over time it takes you out of your own life’ My therapist said this to me today and I literally was shocked. I’ve never heard my relationship with marijuana described so simply and accurately. I’m so happy I’m finally free."
55 days sober. $1353 saved by not smoking. Going to therapy. Lost weight. Got my dream job. Happy again. You can do it! 
"Daily check in. I'm not getting high today. This is what helps me, saying I won't do it. All are welcome to join."
Just made it to day 18 and haven’t skipped a workout or ate fast food during that time period. You guys are awesome 
I did not smoke today I will not smoke tomorrow
"I lost something very important to me while stoned... It's time to quit As the title says. 

I am a traveller, I love to go backpacking and camping and do so almost every weekend. This last weekend I went camping in a new area, so I smoked up and explored like I usually do. It started to get a little late and a thunderstorm was coming, so I knew I had to find a place to set up my hammock and tarp, except when I got back in my car, it wouldn't start. 

I started to freak out because I was in the middle of nowhere and I know next to nothing about auto mechanics, so I packed up my backpack with almost an ounce of weed (everything I had in my car), my wallet, and a bunch of other gear. My plan was to walk until I could find somebody to help, but if I got lost along the way, I still had weed, food, and other stuff. And of course the first thing I did before leaving my car was smoke up.

Well, as it turns out, I only had to walk about a quarter mile before I flagged down a mountain biker, who came with me to my car and quickly knew what was up and fixed it. I was so ecstatic; I thanked him, got in my car, and drove off.... Not knowing I left my backpack on the ground next to my car. I don't know if I ran over it but I'm sure it got soaked in the thunderstorm. 

I drove maybe 2 hours out before I realised I left my backpack. I freaked out again and tore down the mountain roads until I got back to my campsite, but my backpack was gone. 

This backpack had been with me to all 7 continents. I've travelled with it for years and years and it became one of my most treasured possessions. So, I figured its time. I lost it because I was stoned. 

It made me realise: I am so dumb when I'm stoned. I'm a physicist, but because of this habit, I have been struggling to complete classes and I've been neglecting a lot of tasks for my research group.

I have so many more reasons I want to quit, but this was the icing on the cake. My resolve feels stronger than any other time I've wanted to quit. I just hope I can stick to it this time."
"In who cares news, today marks my first full week sober in three years! I was daily heavy user. I couldn't do anything or go anywhere without hitting the pen, pipe, bong, whatever. I never told my family or anyone close to me about my full on addiction. I told myself it was to help my depression, but after a while, a substance doesn't help anything. 
About two weeks ago, I got a cold, and couldn't smoke without it irritating my throat. So I drank the vape juice. Yes, I'm not kidding. Definitely got me high, but after three days of doing that, I finally took a good look at myself and thought ""wtf am I doing? Is this how I want to live my life?"" So I decided enough was enough. 
Keeping myself busy with writing, reading, skating, exercising, and whatever else I can think of to keep my mind off weed. Sleeping is a bitch, and I still feel super foggy, like the morning after a smoking bender, but I'm determined to keep sober.
I kept all my pens, still with juice in them and ready to go, because I feel the true way to conquer an addiction is to have the ability to use, but stare right at it and say ""nah, I'm good.""
Today marks a full week!!! Thanks for reading this! There's no one I could tell who'd understand the struggle. Here's to week two!
To anyone who thinks they can't do it, I didn't think I could either. You absolutely can."
"I smoked weed for the last time on June 17th, 2018... One year ago, today. One year ago today I smoked weed for the last time. I was miserably depressed, hopeless, and I couldn't see a way out. I had tried to stop smoking weed a countless number of times, only to forget completely about my goal and start smoking again.

&#x200B;

For the last month that I was on a bender, I smoked weed primarily with guys I met online, who I was either using for weed or to feel less lonely. I put myself in countless dangerous and silly situations just to get high. One time I drove two hours to smoke a blunt with some guy who kept trying to pressure me into hooking up with him. I had also broken my ankle two months before that, and was still hobbling around, very slowly. One time I had to hobble out of a guy's house who had made me extremely uncomfortable, and I ended up hurting myself even more because I couldn't get away fast enough. Those drives home were filled with desperation, shame, fear, and self loathing. I almost crashed my car multiple times.

&#x200B;

I had to leave school for a second semester in a row, and due to my addiction, I felt hopeless that I would ever graduate.  

&#x200B;

The only two people I could find to actually sell me weed were always ripping me off, but I needed weed to function, so it was either be ripped off and/or receive a stemmy bag, or hang out with these guys I mentioned prior. I had ruined everything positive in my life: my schooling, friendships, relationships. I lied to and hurt the people who cared about me most, and eventually I was all alone. If someone had a problem with my weed smoking, I cut them off, because they were buzz kills and trying to control me. I spent all my money on weed and all of my time was dedicated to it. Everything else was a chore, but weed was a given. 

&#x200B;

I kept buying weed and smoking it when I didn't want to. I couldn't even stand to look at myself in the mirror. I looked dead and I hated myself so much.

&#x200B;

I finally decided to try one more time. I finished my weed on June 17th and I was determined that would be the last time I quit. I had said I would quit so many times, so I don't think I really believed that I would stay away from weed. However, after midnight, I wrote a note to myself in my phone ""June 18th. Just for today."" (https://imgur.com/a/310LvQn the note on my phone). Just for that day, I would not smoke. So I did that. Again and again and again.

&#x200B;

I do recovery to keep myself away from weed. I couldn't quit on my own. I needed help. I have not had to smoke weed since that day, and I am so incredibly grateful. I'm also grateful to r/leaves. You guys have saved my butt more times than I can count.

&#x200B;

I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree a month ago, which was only possible because I got sober. I have true friends now who I show up for emotionally as they do for me. The life is back in my eyes. I look at myself in the mirror and I see a wide eyed, fierce woman looking back at me. I no longer hang out with people I do not want to. I have stayed single since September because I truly needed to work on myself. I do believe that I will eventually show up for someone and be able to have a meaningful relationship when the time is right. I am finally able to be honest, loving, and emotionally present.

&#x200B;

Quitting weed did not make everything better, but it made me ABLE to make my life better. I no longer set fire to my life while trying to put it out with gasoline. I live a non-chaotic life today. Today I am at peace, and today I will NOT smoke weed with you all. Thank you for being a part of my recovery. One day at a time.

&#x200B;

"I was deep cleaning my room and found a whole 6 pack of pre-rolls (top shelf too)... AND I THREW IT AWAY!!! WITH MY OWN HANDS! Not even in my personal trash in my house where I can easily dig up and ""save it"" again. I literally walked outside at \~11:30PM in the rain, and threw it away in the big ol' stinky trash bin!

"Tutorial: How to quit weed and be happy                                          The Introduction
Hello, my name is Dylan. I have been pouring my heart and soul into this post for the 17 days I have been free of weed. I was able to quit with ease, opposed to the many times where I struggled for months only to relapse. I experienced no cravings whatsoever after quitting, and hardly noticed the withdrawals. Happiness was an inevitable byproduct of this process, this fundamental change in attitude. What changed? I will get to that later on, but I would like to start by giving you some context of where I am coming from. 

I’d like to start by saying that weed in and of itself is fine. I still support legalization and recognize that it can be very useful, has many medicinal uses, and is ultimately fine in moderation, like alcohol. The problem is we cannot moderate here - we only abuse. I hope to expose the reality of our situation to you ladies and gents – warning, it may not be the reality you are expecting. The good news is you are not addicted to weed in the slightest. Nope, you read that right. You are not addicted to weed. The bad news is that it is a sign of underlying issues in your life. But don’t worry, I have attempted and hopefully succeeded in creating an actionable plan that can be used to quit weed, make it through the withdrawals, and live happily ever after! If this sounds interesting, please read on!
 
I know it is long, but I have chosen each and every word carefully to convey my message in detail. I wrote this mainly to think through my own struggles with addiction, but edited it to share with everyone here. This isn’t my real account and couldn’t care less about karma so please upvote if this was helpful to you. This community has given me so much support this is the least I could do to repay you guys. Enjoy!  

                                            The Context
I know what you are thinking after reading the title. “Phh, theres no way. I have tried many times and it is never that straightforward. Who does this guy think he is?!"". I am one of you. I am a 21-year-old college student, double-majoring in Accounting and Finance. I am from Denver, Colorado, and therefore have access to weed 24/7. I used to smoke 2-3 grams of weed a day; 3-4 spliffs a day, 3-4 big dabs minimum, and often 10+ “mokes”, AKA weed and tobacco bong rips. I was a fucking mess. And I knew it, but was never able to change. Reading the posts on here for a while, I know I smoke much more than most of you. Not bragging, quite the opposite actually. 

Isn’t that the worst? The guilt of knowing you are sabotaging yourself, but not being able to stop? I was there for 3 years. I know you may be inclined to dismiss my opinion based on being young, not smoking for as long, etc. But please read on; make that decision at the end of my post. If you still think that, call me out in the comments. I don’t mind, I can take it and potentially clear up some misconceptions. I know my message is valuable, hence why I put 25+ hours into this post. 

                                           The Addiction

So you think you want to quit weed, huh? I say “think” because often there is a lot of mixed emotions with this process. Sure, you know it is fucking with your life. That’s why you’re here on /r/leaves. But you also still think you love this plant. You remember the good ol’ days: the joy, laughter, the connections with like-minded individuals, revelations and euphoric moments that seemingly could only stem from marijuana. Even during the bad times, at least Mary Jane was always there to sooth your emotions and make you feel better right? It has always been there for you, to the point where it became a big part of your life. 

We all know that there are alternative ways to get the same high, the same rush of dopamine - we see examples of these everyday on this sub. Hobbies and pastimes that are less expensive, more fun, healthier, etc. We all have surely compiled a list of reasons to quit too. “Its messing with my sleep”, or “Think of the money I could save”. But it never seems to work, right? You have always known you need to quit, and articulating it can reinforce these reasons, but it often doesn’t seem to stick does it?

 You find that after a few days, your weed-addicted brain tears those reasons to shreds. “It won’t be that expensive if I smoke ___ times a month!” or the biggest lie, “I finally have control and can now smoke again”. If you could control your weed usage, you wouldn’t be here. Sometimes, you relapse because you truly have convinced yourself that you cannot function or be happy sober, so you reluctantly return back to the marijuana. 

Want to know why? It will sound like an accusation, but it is the underlying truth of the situation. You never made a serious attempt to change the mindset that drives these compulsions. You have been trying control your actions by quitting WEED, not the mindset that dictates our actions. Therefore it is no surprise that many simply trade on addition for another. Still the same underlying thought process, just a different addiction. You are still desperately seeking for external sources to derive meaning and happiness from. When in reality, happiness blooms from within. 

Deep down, or maybe not even that deep down, you still wish you could smoke if it just didn’t do ______ to you. You still think weed could play a role in your life. You still want to smoke every day if things were different, some alternate reality in which it was actually harmless. Unfortunately you live in this universe where it is holding you back, to a degree that you may not even realize. I certainly didn’t for a long time. It made me complacent; I was happy being a stoner and therefore stopped attempting to reach my admittedly ambitious goals. I hope to elaborate on this fundamental concept further in the following parable I wrote, appropriately titled: The Mirage.  
 
                                            The Mirage 

Imagine yourself in the third person. You are walking in a forest, probably smoking a nicely rolled joint or hitting your favorite pipe. It is a beautiful forest, no matter if you are sober or high. Green foliage as far as the eye can see, dense trees and wildlife abound. You can go any direction you’d like, but you chose stick to the path. Everyone else always seems to, and you’re pretty sure you don’t have a choice to stray if you tried. Though the areas beyond the path are breathtaking, they are also a bit intimidating; you almost never see footprints outside of the path. 

After walking for what seems like an eternity, you come across a fork in the path. Down one path is a Hedonist’s dream. It is your favorite hiking spot, the base of a large ravine with a huge river pouring down the middle. It has all your favorite activities; limitless high quality bud, wax, maybe even tobacco if you’re like me. It has a big television to re-watch sitcoms, and an xbox with a VR headset to play the latest games. It has a nice record player for your favorite albums. Everything is covered in silky velvet and extremely comfortable. It is full of delicious food and drink, and you wonder if you just found heaven on earth. 

There is no responsibility down this path; you are free to spend your time doing whatever you’d like. It has all your stoner buds too, all passing the bong and laughing about everything and anything. Of course you see yourself running down that path. You’ve always been a little unsatisfied with life, and this seems like the ultimate escape from what seems like an otherwise mundane and stressful life. You see yourself sit down and rip that first bowl with your buds, thinking you could live here for the rest of your life. And so you do. You smoke so much weed that you are permanently couch-locked. You enjoy any and all food you can get your hands on. Your buddies tell stories from your youth, sometimes repeating themselves. You don’t mind though, you’re ripped after all, barely listening.  Days, months, and finally years go by. You believe yourself to have everything one needs to be happy. Therefore, you truly believe you are happy. Sure, you are occasionally curious what that other path was, and why it even exists. Surely everyone would make the same decision given the same circumstances, right? 

The other path is covered in rocks and foliage. It seems like a continuous, un-ending incline. The trees are denser initially, resulting in a dark hue across the forest. It seems to be less traveled, but you still notice the occasional fresh footprint. Many seem to have gone down this path in the past. Parts of the path have eroded completely, while others lead back to the weed-filled life. You notice further down that this path also continues to branch off. The trees clear to reveal meadows lush with flowers on some paths, while others are encased in darkness with the stench of death in the air. In fact, it seems this forest has endless different paths one could take depending on their inclination.  Each path seems to offer its own unique beauty and charm on the surface. You still are left wondering why anyone would chose any of these paths, as their seems to be no comfort, no safety. The trails end often, with individuals gathering and forming small communities. Some of them seem happy, but you are not convinced. 

You see evidence that others have arrived at these dead ends, but chosen to continue onwards instead of settling or turning back. Do they know something that these others do not, or are they simply mad? You notice a man breaking off from one of these dead-ends, forming his own path into the forest. He is wearing tattered clothing, only carrying what he deems essential for life. He seems miserable at first glance, often falling over and covered in bruises. He looks very old, but under closer inspection is only a few years older than yourself. You then notice that beneath the dirt smeared across his face, he is smiling. You are shocked; you ask yourself how could a man with nothing, no comfort or safety, seem happier than your friends and yourself even. You start to resent him; he obviously is crazy or delusional for seeking out this dangerous path riddled with warning signs of failure and misery. 

It is obvious that many have chosen to turn back at this point in the forest, or chosen to settle for a dead-end that brings them comfort and security. This man, on the other hand, speeds up as he passes a dead-end. Doesn’t he know the trail ends here, you ask yourself? His smile broadens, and he begins running as fast as he can up into a seemingly hazardous area. You yell out to him, asking, “Are you lost? Why are you out here all alone?”

He stops running, and invites you to walk with him for a bit. He explains that he initially came out here with all his friends years ago after graduating high school. He says that soon after they began this exciting journey, one of his friends found another path in the forest that leads to a place full of happiness, sheltered from the hardships they were encountering. He found a mirage, the man explains - a prison that presents itself as a paradise free from pain. They would would stay in contact, slowly convincing his other friends to join him after the trials of this path became too much to handle. Initially, they would try and continue to talk to the man, asking when he was going to return to them. The friends would tell him about how much he was missing, and how everything was so much better with them. But he didn’t see it that way. 

The man loved the challenges he faced on a daily basis. He admitted that it wasn’t always easy; in fact, he had even gone back to the start at times to join his friends. But it never did anything for him. Sure, he found it comforting. He found it enjoyable at first. But deep down he always knew it was a prison. He knew deep down that this path, this mirage, was a dead end; it was a purgatory for those too afraid to see what the other paths had to offer. Driven mad by the monotony and numbness of the so-called “paradise”, he continued down other paths, sometimes turning back, sometimes struggling for months before reaching an end. 

He had accomplished many things in that time away from his comforts. He had found great joy down other paths, things that brought him the same level of joy his friends had found. And yet, it was different; he felt a sense of accomplishment, a sense of satisfaction that his efforts were not in vein. That being said, he was never satisfied with these either. The main explained that he discovered the further he pushed himself, the greater the end result always was. He quickly started choosing to often break-off from the path entirely, discovering new ways of reaching these end-results, these dead-ends that had stopped many before him in their tracks. Quicker ways, more efficient ways. He learned to identify which paths were worth avoiding, and which were worth his time and energy. Though the challenges never ceased, they became easier to tackle.

 The man found that each dead-end had many potential paths that were simply unmarked; reserved for those brave enough to tackle them. After some research, he found that many of the world’s most successful people had gone down unmarked paths similar to those he was chasing. He became more adept at finding these hidden paths, while becoming more capable at dealing with the hardships thrown at him in the process. His body and mind had grown stronger, while his friend’s bodies withered away in front of the TV. While they were busy playing video games, he had slowly discovered an inner peace, a satisfaction with never being satisfied. He had come to accept these daily challenges as part of this path he chose. He had made peace with it, as he knew deep down it was necessary if he wanted to become the best version of himself. He went from being afraid of the challenges initially, to running at them full speed. He no longer feared the pain, but accepted it as part of the process. He even began to enjoy the pain, as it meant he was doing something worth his time and energy.

After this many years, his worst fear had become his best friends aspirations.  Complacency.  Being satisfied doing nothing, being satisfied with reaching a decent end result. Decent was no longer good enough for the man, he claimed. Sure, a moment of stillness was welcomed, and necessary, to rest his aging bones and occasionally soak in the beauty around him. Too long, however, and anxiety filled his thoughts. Fear of missing opportunities, fear of a mundane life. After his experiences in that mirage, and seeing what it did to his friends, he knew that it he could never settle anymore. He had experienced too much, achieved too much, risen too much to slide all the way back to the start. He knew that these trials he faced are a natural part of choosing this life, the path that many of humanities greatest individuals had been down before.  He knew that pain and struggle were natural phenomenon, and therefore should not be avoided. 

The man had realized realized that the “paradise” was the only thing unnatural in this forest. People escaping reality by hiding from it right at the start of their journey, never experiencing the joys and successes that the other countless paths had to offer. Sure, they know they exist, but they cling to the belief that the challenges couldn’t possibly be worth the payoff. And in a sense, the man said, they were right. The payoff isn’t worth it. But the man understood something that his friends could never hope to; life isn’t about the end result at all, but about the journey one take to strive towards it. Many times the man had achieved his goal, only to find the goal wasn’t what he expected. Many times the man had spent months working for something, only to have the path blocked by something unforeseeable and out of his control. But the man didn’t fret, as in the process of chasing these goals, he had learned more about himself than his friends ever would - what he was capable of, what his real goals and aspirations are, and how to better implement a plan to achieve them. Over the years apart, the man had developed a broad range of skills to face even the most difficult times with ease, while his friends never developed these skills at all. He knew could weather the most brutal trials and tribulations, while his friends lived and died without ever exploring their true capabilities and potential. While his friends had only been focused on what the forest could give to them, the man realized early on that it isn’t what we get from achieving our goals that is important, but what you become from striving to achieve them. 

                                           The struggle

 

“People are not lazy. They simply have impotent goals - that is, goals that do not inspire them.” 

So the first part of changing your mindset is understanding what you want and expect from life. So my question to you is: where do you see yourself in 5 years? No, you didn’t accidently stumble into an interview. That being said, there is a very specific reason they ask you this question. It is asked to see if your goals line up with the companies core values. So, answer that question honestly. Then, ask yourself if it is inline with your core values. When I was smoking heavy, I saw myself smoking heavily for far longer than 5 years into the future. I also saw myself continuing to hiding it from my family, I saw the thousands of dollars I would spend on it, and I saw myself continuing to do whatever it takes to keep smoking this plant. I wouldn’t have hesitated cheating on a drug test, or lie to anyone who I didn’t want to know about it. I wouldn’t hesitate to put my health and safety into question to continue chasing this high. I would have kept smoking no matter what it cost me. 

Core values are a critical element of any individual, and it is often what seperates different cultures and groups of people from one another. Hopefully you have a good idea of what yours are, but if not this is a great time to reflect. A good way to identify them is think of the most ideal person in the world in your eyes, or someone you look up to. What would their opinions be on everyday interactions, hobbies, pastimes, politics, or current events? Would they value integrity? Would they give back to their community? Also, what would they be against? Would they support cheaters, would they accept of my tendency to lie about my habits? There are plenty of resources online for this part too. My 3 most important core values are determination, integrity, and generosity. I see my ideal self striving to achieve any goal I put my mind too, no matter how painful or inconvenient. I see myself not lying to family, friends and others who deserve the truth. I also don’t see myself intentionally misleading people, which is a constant reality for a young stoner like myself. I see myself ideally giving back to my communities I consider myself apart of, whether with my time and energy, or a monetary donation. 

So, how well did I stack up? Extremely poorly is my honest answer. I constantly lie to many people in my life - no one is off limits. I have lied to teachers, I lie to employers, I lie to my parents about weed, money, and even the most mundane things for fun. I have never been generous since I started smoking weed. I have denied homeless people food when I have plenty, and have stolen so much weed in my life I lost count. I have showed little empathy to friends and family. I have so much love to give to the world, but instead I just focused on myself and nothing else. I always put myself first and look where it got me. Nowhere. I am more miserable than ever, so don’t worry; I didn’t get away with any of it in the end. 

After an analysis of how my thought process differed from my actions, I realized that something had to give. What I thought I valued was **meaningless** if I could not act on any of it. I was that friend that would say I wanted to do xyz, and then never follow through. I became known for it. I was also that friend that would be cool to your face, only to talk about your flaws behind your back. I talked about close friends in hurtful ways and even bullied some of my less-close friends. I didn’t care, as long as it helped me. It was all about ME. I couldn’t care less when I heard 40+ US citizens were mowed down in a bar in Florida a few months ago, as long as it wasn’t **ME**. Sure, I put on a mask and pretended to care, but I didn’t. It had no impact on me. Getting high was the same - all about me and how I felt, not about how it affected others. 

                                            The Shift 

I am not oblivious; I knew how weed was effecting my actions and causing me to change as an individual. I saw the signs early and often. But you know the great thing about weed is that it can suppress these thoughts. Those nagging pings from my sober self, yelling at me to stop being such a self-centered prick, were silenced completely until I honestly 100% thought my actions were OK and justified. So what was I escaping from, why was I starting to act in such a harmful way towards myself and those around me? It was because I hated myself and weed was slowly stopping to suppress this reality. Why did I hate myself? Because I have an acute anxiety about failure, creating a viscous cycle. I would start to slip in school, have strong pings of anxiety, and use weed to comfort me. The weed would cause me to slip more in school, and therefore more anxiety, followed by, you guessed it – more pot. I have always put extreme pressure on myself, its just how I was raised. I wanted to be the best, but for the first time in my life, it was becoming more and more clear that I wasn’t. So I lashed out. I was angry at the world, and was so fed up with it that I retreated entirely. I quit. Sure, I kept trying to study and do my best, but emotionally I was dead. My moral compass had disappeared in a cloud of smoke; I felt I was wronged, so I did wrong. This is why I was accepting of all the ignorant shit I was doing. This is how I justified my actions. Things weren’t going how I wanted, so like a spoiled brat I spent all my time in my room focusing on my own feelings. Over and over, I would play the same situations in my head. I was the ultimate white knight, only I was protecting myself from the seemingly harsh realities of life. When in reality, I am extremely fortunate and blessed, but was too distracted to see it. 


So what changed? What triggered the change in mindset? Honestly, it was a single quote. 

“Be the best version of yourself”

I wasn’t. Not only was I engaging in the egotistical, disgusting activities listed above, but weed had also started to cause me to fail my classes. “How do I know it was weed, could be anything!” you may be thinking. Well, I have always been quite studious. As a double-major, I spend the majority of my free time studying. We are talking 5 hours of classes a day and 5 hours of studying too. On the weekends I would take Adderall and study for 8+ hours. But even with all this effort, I was failing. Now more than ever, literally failing. And it was because I was smoking before, during and after studying. I don’t know what I was thinking, but once I received those grades it was obvious that if I didn’t make a drastic change then I would fail this semester, therefore graduating late and having my job offer revoked. 

I saw myself as having two distinct choices; two different paths in my journey through the forest. I could continue smoking and potentially ruin my future, or I could quit right there. The choice was finally clear. It was obvious that weed had no place in my life anymore. It had always been obvious to everyone but myself. Once I had this epiphany, quitting weed became as easy as quitting coffee. Sure, I suffered through minor withdrawals. I failed to sleep more than a few hours every night the first week. I had trouble eating and was often waking up dry heaving from the nausea. But I have a few tips that I can share later on that really helped me overcome these symptoms and others with relative ease. 

So why do we seem to struggle with addiction when so many others can use weed and other substances as intended? The key difference is mindset. They are using it to enhance life, while you are using it as a crutch to get through life. “But Dylan, I use marijuana when I go hiking! It makes it so much better!” Im sure you do, that was my favorite time too. But I bet you are just as likely to use it when you are feeling down too. I bet that when you get home after a rough day, tired and beaten down by lifes daily trials, your first thought is to light up. Im willing to bet that you use it for almost every emotion imaginable. Happy, sad, lonely, depressed, overjoyed, angry, confused, bored. At that point, it is no longer enhancing life. It is life. It is where you derive stability, to level out the highs and lows. Eventually, if you smoke enough for long enough, you end up flat-lining completely.  Imagine a life support machine, slowly transitioning from steady peaks and valleys to the dreaded flat-line. We all know what that means, the end of the individuals body and soul. Only, weed is much slower then that. It is obvious to friends and family that you are changing, but you hardly notice. It is only when you are dead inside that you look up and see that everyone has written you off as dead for years, not without lack of trying on their part, but lack of reciprocation on yours. 


No matter your current circumstances, you too are facing a crossroad in your life. Maybe you haven’t been pushed to the wall yet. Maybe it truly hasn’t effected you that much. My response to these claims and those of a similar nature is simple. Why wait? Why wait until your habit hurts a loved one. Why wait till it puts you in financial jeopardy. Why wait till it has caused you so much pain that you are driven into a depressive state. Why are you so afraid of living a sober life, a life where you are free to chase your goals and aspirations at any time of the day. Are you really that satisfied with your current status that you think giving up weed will only detract from your happiness? Imagine meeting an alternate version of yourself, a version that hadn’t welcomed weed into your life. How would you picture him or her? Surely they would be more successful and happy, spending their free time enriching their in mind, body and soul opposed to burning a dried out plant. Our brain can trick us into believing almost anything, but it cannot distort reality enough to suggest that we are happier wasting a significant portion of our lives smoking weed. 

Whether you like it or not, the only time you can make this change and get back on the right path is now. The only thing that truly exists in the world is this current moment. You cannot change how you spent all those years; you cannot get back the money you’ve figuratively burned to chase a high that is no longer obtainable. But you can still change. You can stop smoking right now. No, you don’t have to finish your stash first. You don’t have to wait till Tuesday, or some other arbitrary point in the future to quit. The future doesn’t exist and will never exist in a sense; it will always be the future. If you truly want to be the best version of yourself and taste the sweet fruit that life offers to those brave enough to face it head on, you need to make your last smoke just that – your last smoke. 

                                         The Withdrawls 
Once you make the decision, I promise you it will not be has hard as it seems. You will suffer initially, but what are a few days of suffering compared to a lifetime of greatness and achievement. You can expect, at worst, one to two weeks of moderate symptoms. Difficulty sleeping, nausea, loss of appetite, and irritability are all semi-common. Gosh, don’t those sound lame when put into perspective? It’s the mental aspect that was always the hard part. Without the addicts brain consistently doubting your decision, weed withdrawals are about as extreme as a hangover, and typically last a similar amount of time. They are nothing to fear; in fact, they should be embraced. It’s the first signs of the end of your addiction. These are not permanent in the slightest and will pass as quickly as they appeared. 

Now, the part of withdrawals that were most noticeable to me was fogginess in the head, lightheadedness, anxiety and fatigue. For myself, I found that taking a multi-vitamin, fish oil, magnesium, and iron supplements were critical to rebounding quickly. I will start by discussing the last two, magnesium and iron. Anemia occurs when you have a level of red blood cells (RBCs) in your blood that is lower than normal. This occurs when you are not getting enough Iron in your diet. The symptoms of low Iron are fatigue, lightheadedness, and fogginess. Sound familiar? I have a theory that since most stoners (not all of course) seem to have a poor diet, lacking in red meats, eggs, and leafy greens, that they are often low on Iron. A simple supplement once a day, preferably with vitamin C for absorption, should get you on the right track. Magnesium is a bit trickier. Many of the symptoms of low magnesium are not unique to magnesium deficiency, making it difficult to diagnose with 100% accuracy. That being said, suffers are often filled with anxiety, depression, fatigue, lightheadedness, etc. Vague symptoms, but it is present in most multivitamins so it is worth experimenting with. I found that it helped my anxiety, but it can be hard to determine if it’s a placebo or the magnesium itself. On top of all of this, focus on drinking as much water as possible. This will help you feel refreshed for starters, but also should help with fatigue and fogginess as well. Plus, the whole vital for life thing too ☺ 



                                         The Replacement
Most people on this earth have some sort of coping mechanism to deal with the trials faced in everyday life. Some play video games or binge watch TV, others find themselves getting lost in an art project or other creative outlet. I believe that implementing healthier activities into your life is critical for filling the void in your life left after quitting weed. This time, however, it is important that your coping mechanism is building up your core values, not acting as a detriment to yourself and your character. Sure, in an ideal world you would only derive your happiness from within, and that is still the end goal. For now, I needed some way of focusing all my free time into something productive. I have been practicing meditation to stabilize my emotions, rid myself of anxiety, and rid myself of all thoughts entirely for a short time. This has helped me tremendously in getting the same calmness, the same stillness that I only occasionally got from weed in the first place. For me, I also replaced marijuana with skateboarding and learning how to draw with charcoal. These work for me because I love being creative and staying physically fit. They are in line with my core values as I have poured my heart and soul into them, and have even started giving skateboard lessons to a friend’s brother to help pass on my skills. 

This subreddit has many examples of great, healthier coping mechanisms that you can incorporate. But honestly, you know what works for you best. What are your passions? If you can’t think of something specific, or don’t have the same passions anymore and don’t know where to start, I may be able to help. Exercise is a big one, as it releases plenty of dopamine and can help accelerate THC leaving your body.  Creativity is another critical aspect of our lives that is often overlooked. I think creative pastimes are so, so important as they allow us to truly be engrossed in the process. They stimulate both sides of our brain like nothing else, and can be very helpful for thinking of unique solutions to the daily struggles in your life. I am very career focused, so I would also try and find a program/skill/hobby that can be used to leverage your knowledge and experience in your field. For example, I recently started teaching my self a data-analytics software called Essbase. Sound boring? Its not. Boring activities are not actually boring; it’s a sign that you have a boring mind. Life is all about perspective. Sure, you can cast off everything that sounds confusing and difficult as too boring to be worth it. But, what if you accepted the mundaneness and eventually learned to love it? Data-analytics, for those unaware, is using a large volume of data from multiple sources to derive patterns and therefore conclusions. These conclusions can be used to market a firms product or service more effectively, and with less resources. This increases the enterprise value of the firm and overall leads to more profit. While you may look at the data and be put off right away, if you can just spend enough time to learn how to interpret it, it becomes extremely fun. Its fun like solving a puzzle is fun. It stimulates your brain, forces you to think critically and and use the analytical part of your brain, while also leveraging the creative side. If you do it right, you and everyone else at the company is going to make more money and have more job security. 

Im not saying you have to love data-analytics. Of course not! It was just an example of how casting aside potential career building activities because they’re not fun is silly. I think that if you find your ideal industry and put effort into specializing in some aspect of it that calls to you, you will be much better off. You won’t be passionate about them all, but don’t disregard them without giving them a fair shot. 
Are you in IT and don’t know how to code or want to learn a new language? Good time to start! Do you love music but want to branch out your career? Take an online music management course. Learn a new instrument. Are you working a dead-end job and don’t know where to begin? Maybe start looking for unions in your area and see if there are online resources to build a knowledge base on and maybe get an online certificate.  These are just my ideas. I know nothing about what you will find interesting or what your goals are. This is the hard part. 

                                      The Summary & Conclusion
In conclusion, quitting weed is entirely doable once you accept that there is an underlying cause for the addiction. Weed is not and never was the problem; the problem is internal, not external. The problem is your outlook in life and weed is just playing a role in this.  I was a whiny teenager who only cared about the worlds impact on myself, not my impact on the world. I eventually had my back thrown against the wall, finally revealing how silly the whole thing was. But it doesn't have to go that far. You don't have to be pinned against the wall, faced with an ultimatum. Comfort is overrated anyways; I doubt you would like to sit in a beanbag chair watching TV for the rest of your life. Comfort is the enemy of achievement. If you want to succeed more then you want to be comfortable, more then you want to smoke pot, then and only then will you be successful. 

“I was drawn to all the wrong things: I liked to drink, I was lazy, I didn't have a god, politics, ideas, ideals. I was settled into nothingness; a kind of non-being, and I accepted it. I didn't make for an interesting person. I didn't want to be interesting, it was too hard. What I really wanted was only a soft, hazy space to live in, and to be left alone. On the other hand, when I got drunk I screamed, went crazy, got all out of hand. One kind of behavior didn't fit the other. I didn't care.” 

I find a lot of similarities between weed abuse and alcohol abuse. Same underlying emotions, same actions as a result - just a different substance driving it. Just because weed doesn't damage your liver doesn't make it better. Do your core values line up with your actions? If not, it’s time to re-evaluate. 

I hope you enjoyed this write-up, let me know if any parts were confusing and I can elaborate further.

I am now on day 7 of quitting cigs too which has been much easier then this whole ordeal which I think is interesting... but still challenging of course. Hope all is well and that you are able to **achieve the freedom you deserve in 2018! Love all of you, stay strong!!**

**EDIT 3:** 7/17/18 - Still love recieving the PM's and I am STILL SOBER! Please, do not hesitate.

Or skype or a phonecall; just lemme know your info in a PM and we can set up a time to chat. Peace :) "
"You don’t realize how it affects you until you stop. Long time lurker and I usually never post but this sub has really helped me so I thought I’d share some insight on my experience. 

It’s true! Everything you read here about the negatives with marijuana are true. I think the most dangerous thing about it is that it’s not dangerous at all! Not life threatening at least. You can’t overdose, you can keep goin and goin and without even realizing it you’ve fallen down a dark path. It takes a strong individual to come to the realization that they need to stop. It’s one of the reasons I have a deep appreciation for this sub.

These are the things I’ve learned after I’ve decided to stop using. Aside from your appetite and your sleep, there are many other factors that weed controls. For me at least, I never realized how many feelings I suppress by using. I’ve always tried to be aware about using when I’m in a “good” mood and not as an escape, but let’s be real we wouldn’t be addicted if that was the case. The first week I stopped, all the emotions I was suppressing came out all at once! When I say all at once I mean it, I would be angry one minute then crying the next, I would have moments of happiness and motivation then pure self hatred next. My patience for people was at an all time low. Luckily I wasn’t going out much bc of COVID but goddamn when I did I would snap at the most random things. Some justifiable some not so much. As a usually calm and level headed person this was strange to me.

It took a bit of time to realize that this current person is not who I really am and that years of use may have altered some things within me. I decided to stick it through and acknowledge the fact that my body is adjusting to the changes I’ve made and boy am I glad I did that! It’s been about a month and almost every aspect of my life has improved. At the end of the day using any type of substance to cope with difficult emotions is unhealthy and I urge everyone to acknowledge their emotions and to try to deal with them head on instead of avoiding them and having them backfire later. 

Once again I’d like to thank this sub for really opening my eyes and I hope this post helped some people that might be going through what I experienced. Lastly I’d like to say; stay strong, never stop believing in yourself and don’t be afraid to ask your loved ones for help! We’re on this rollercoaster ride together.

Best regards, VJ"
I have a year today:) 
"Just a suggestion :) You know how when you first started smoking, you thought:

“I wonder what it will be like to try (x activity) while high?”

Well, now you’re likely in a place where you’re high most of the time. You want to be sober. So why not think:

“I wonder what it will be like to go back to doing (x activity) while sober?” 

This method has really helped me develop a newfound appreciation for the finer details I always missed when I was lit :) 

In a way, it’s almost like doing those things again for the first time, because the weed had me so out of touch with reality. 

 hope this helps!"
"What weed really does to me (HINT: It's not worth it) I made it about 12 days, and was feeling so good...more energy, clear headed and all that jazz. 

I'm trying to be positive and remind myself that hey, at least I didn't let myself lose control for more than a few days. I'm back here. I saw someone post a list before ""What it really does to me,"" so here is mine, as a reminder to myself: 

1. It steals my energy. 
2. It makes me overeat. 
3. It occupies way too much of my mental space. 
4. It causes me to lose time. 
5. It drains my wallet. 
6. It makes me stumble over my words and sound generally less intelligent.
7. It puts me in a bad mood when I'm coming down.
8. It makes me selfish. This isn't the drug's fault, but I am an addict and therefore I prioritize getting high over all else. 
9. It increases my anxiety and gives me uncomfortable body sensations.
10. It makes me feel foggy and slow. 

We've got this leavers, one day at a time."
Longest Streak In 5 Years 
"After 14 years of daily weed abuse and 25000 joints, I am now sober for 53 days Hi guys,

I used to scroll this topic alot, while smoking.
I've been smoking since I was 16, more regular in my last 2 years of highschool, and daily after that.
I remember when I started Uni, and I just felt the urge to smoke, went home, light one up and never came back...

I've never really worked jobs longer then 4 months, and was always high. You know how it goes: you still function well because everybody knows you like that.

I had alot of trauma in my life, in a 6 months stretch I lost my mother due to cancer, my house burned on fire due to electricity malfunction and my father commited suïcide.
To make matters worse I had a psychopath 'friend' who was out to get me back cause his girlfriend had a crush on me, and tried to use this period to set people up against me.

I finally quit on the 14th of August.
This was the final drop: I've met an amazing girl who became my girlfriend, and I went camping in her backyard. When we woke up, she made breakfast and after that I just filled some dumb excuse to leave and go home smoking weed. I remember laying down in bed, offcourse smoking, I always had a rolled joint, always and she texted me that she wanted to break up.

It broke my heart, but I understood.
After that I was sick of IT, couldn't believe I even fucked that up...
I planned a session for weedhypnosis, and suprisingly it kind of worked. I was sweating tremendous from my hands the first week, and I could smell the weed from met odor, but no real withdrawels for the rest.

I am still jobless (I live of poker, music and investments) and somewhat still lazy, see my friends a lot less, lost one good friend, felt like he was using me and when I adressed all the things for him, he didn't take it the wrong wat. You think everything will be fixed after you quit weed, but you still have your weaknesses and everything, but I am still proud.

I also got my girlfriend back, and it's going better then ever. She is a active kind person and my abuse just didn't match.

All I want to say is, if I can do it everybody can but you have to make the concious decision and maybe even try hypnosis.

Best of luck to all"
"When I was a stoner I never thought I would go this long without weed. But honestly, life without weed is so much better in every way. "
100 DAYS! - my life hasn’t been the easiest recently. had to quit my landscaping job because i got tinnitus. my cousin who i only recently got back in contact after 10 years died from a blood clot. me and my girl had to break up cos the distance got to hard and missing her so much. but i made it 💯 
"Today marks 20 days since I've quit weed, alcohol, tobacco and replaced coffee with tea Twenty days ago I said to myself that I need to make a change if I want to achieve something in my life. I was tired of feeling like shit everyday and showing up high home to my family. The first few days were actually easier than days 10 and all the way to 17. On those days I was really feeling down and had almost zero motivation. I'm back on the good days right now :D.

How has quiting cold turkey benefited me?

-I feel and look better

-No more brainfog and more clarity

-I don't skip breakfast or other meals

-I brush my teeth 2 times a day

-I have more focus and actually get stuff done

-No hangovers

-Sleeping has improved and I'm dreaming again regularly 

-I workout much more (I also reccomend you start running, such an easy exercise to do anywhere and holds so many physical and mental benefits)

-I know I have the power and control to reach my ambitions

-I don't skip classes

-I appreciate my life and I'm grateful for everything I have

There is much more, these were just the ones on top of my head.

Quiting is very worth it. You have to be 100% sure you want to quit and know why you're doing this. It will be easier to turn down weed and decrease the chances of relapsing. 
If you quit with passion it will be much more enjoyable and easier for you.

Life is too short to waste it."
"How addiction works in the brain... I posted this as a comment and I got a few private messages saying I should post it to the whole group. Some of us are truly world champions at being so incredibly hard on ourselves, and that can make staying sober even harder. So, maybe this can help a few people realize, your brain is working just fine. It's doing what it was meant to do, and you just need some 'updating' of your knowledge.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The way addiction works in the brain is like this; You know how you drive to the grocery store from your house? You probably don't even need to think about it. It's ingrained there in a neural pathway cause you've just done it so many times and your brain doesn't have to use much energy to do something its done repeatedly.

Now, when you're doing something new that you've never done before.. its like driving to the grocery store from your house .. but across everyone's yards and driveways, knocking down their bushes and trash cans. But after a while, if you kept driving thru everyone's yards it would knock down the bushes, tamp down the grass and pretty soon you'd have a smooth path that you could drive on.

This is how the brain works - we use the well worn neural pathways the most. We are always making new pathways (unless we're down regulating our brains thru drugs, alcohol, stimulants, etc) and paving over old habits that we aren't doing anymore or lost interest in. You can actually see this in MRIs., fascinating stuff.

Now the brain is designed to **seek pleasure, avoid pain and conserve energy (the motivational triad)** . So whatever we seek pleasure in (or any other repetitive behaviors) becomes one of those very well worn pathways and our brains don't have to use much energy for repetitive habits. It's easy to keep going back to the habit your brain knows because it is seeking pleasure and conserving energy to stay alive. A lot of us will say, ""I don't want to keep smoking, why am I doing this?"" Well, this is why.

Your new neural pathways from being sober are going to take a bit of time to get inculcated (let's call this You 2.0) you are literally updating your own operating system now.  Branding yourself an 'addictive personality' is probably a misnomer.

You just have habits. Nothing bad or good. Just habits. Like all the other humans 😊 And soon, you will have new habits.

So, be gentle with yourself and maybe give your brain new things to 'play with.' Brains love goals and working on problems. Start thinking about what you want to accomplish today, this month, next month, next year, five years, etc.

You got his..

**Edited to say thank you for the gold! I'm thankful people found it helpful** 😊"
Upvote this if you are strong individual who doesn't need any weed today! My housemate have been smoking since midnight last night but I'm proud of myself for being able to just walk away and not give in to this day like I have the past 7 years of my life.
"Random thought on being a “functional” stoner Hey guys. Currently on the sober train after many failed attempts. Got to thinking about this the other day:

I’d describe myself, probably along with many others, as having been a “functional” stoner. Graduated early with several internships and decent grades. Been employed and doing pretty well at work since I left college. Fairly regular exercise routine and social life etc. 

All this is pretty good for a daily user, yeah? I used to pride myself on being a functional stoner. But the other day, I just thought...Is that really all I aspire to, all I want to be in this life? “Functional”? Why not: successful, accomplished, passionate, loving, driven, excited, vibrant, etc? Why just stop at getting by or doing “pretty well” all things considered?

If this is how I’ve managed with daily weed use, I can only imagine where I’d be without it. but it’s never too late, so here’s to a fresh start."
"38 days clean and I realize boredom is a part of life I’ve grown up with this fantasy that everyone else is always doing something fun and exciting all the time with friends and I’m the only person who has to sit with boredom and being alone. But as I’ve gotten more clean time, I’m realizing that my understanding of how others were living was skewed. While it’s good to be busy, no one can be busy all the time. And for those people who are never alone, I think that speaks volumes about their ability to sit with themselves/their thoughts."
"A REALLY good reason to go sober: you can differentiate your high mind from your sober one Whenever I’m in a stoner phase, I start to believe my high thoughts are my actual thoughts and it fucks with my sense of self. It’s nice to be sober for a bit so you can remember who you really are"
Sober me wants to get high. High me wants to get sober. 
"Sober Mama is way more chill than stoned Mama My mood is more stable now. Even when I'm tired, my responses are more thought out and aren't reactive. I have more patience with my kids and myself. I am a better paremt now :)"
"I did it . 90 days weed free . First huge milestone. This is officially the second longest I’ve gone without smoking and I’ve never felt better .

Just wanted to share this victory"
"Progress Had a shit day today and felt really depressed. Long story short, I asked my brother for a joint after being 14 days clean. I picked it up, rolled it, went to my favourite smoking spot to go numb myself as I always would. 

Couldn't bring myself to light it and ended up throwing it away, as I knew I would regret it immediately. This is something I've never been able to do previously.

Progress."
Merry Christmas to everyone who is going through the first cannabis free Christmas in several years. 
"Your brain saying ""I think I can go back to moderation, it will be different this time..."" is just two cravings standing on each other's shoulders in a trenchcoat and a hat. It seems like a mature thought, but you have to remind yourself that it's just a craving like anything else. "
People don’t really like weed I know a lot of people love weed. It helps them a lot. But there are a lot of people who think they like it but really don’t. They love the feeling of smoking and rolling up and blowing loud but the actual high they hate. When they’re sober they don’t realize how much they hate it so they keep doing it. As soon as they get high they realize they hate it so much. Do any of y’all feel this way?
"My Laughter Is Sweeter When I am Sober My laughter is sweeter when I am sober

My breath comes easy, and I am my own

The morning is heaven when I am sober

The once hateful daylight soaks into my bones

&#x200B;

My eyes are much brighter

My legs are much lighter

My heart swells with courage for I am a fighter

My dreams, wayward snowbirds, have returned to their perches

My unconscious frivols and fables unravel

My memory recovers, I know what my worth is

My mind is decluttered, I speak, rather than ramble

&#x200B;

My laughter is sweeter when I am sober

I'm done with my flight from myself and my soul

My life is imperfect, and far, far from over

Unburdened, I stand now to watch it unfold

As the sun rises another day is done. As the hours pass by each symptom is gone. Im on day 7 and my will power is strong. Good morning every one. keep going 
"Replace your weed habit with something that you enjoy sober but don’t enjoy high For example I can’t read a book when I’m high. I just don’t have the focus or mental capacity to sit there reading and actually understand what’s going on. But I love reading when I’m not high. So I did some research and found a book I knew I’d love and every time I had a craving at night I would read that book. It really helped me to initially stop smoking and it gave me something to look forward to. 

What’s something that you enjoy sober or think you could enjoy but that you usually don’t do after smoking? Maybe you like art, or baking, or working out but when you’re blazed you usually don’t bother. Try replacing the times you would be smoking with this hobby! And just like I bought a new book, maybe you could buy some new art supplies or workout gloves for example. It serves as inspiration and a reminder to indulge in that hobby rather than smoking. I hope this tip helps and cheers to a new year!"

I’ve completed a full week by now and have been able to don’t touch any tobacco for a full week too!"
My weed addiction snuck up on me and stayed around long after it made itself known. I have a crystal clear recollection of stumbling across r/leaves at one time and then quickly leaving because it was much too threatening. Since quitting this past June it’s been a major daily support. Thank you all. Daily visits here give me insight and courage to stay the course. Folks who are just starting out get my comments encouraging them to go ahead and know it does get easier - that sleep returns along with ones appetite. Folks who post about relapsing evoke my profound gratitude for helping warn me of the pitfalls of thinking I can smoke ‘just this once’ without paying a price. Long term users (like me) who post their stories help me feel like less of a fool for allowing the decades to have slipped by. Every single day I live without my old habit getting the better of gives me a sense of pride as well as humility. I feel proud I have made it through another day weed-free and also deeply humbled that somehow I have managed to find the strength to avoid using. I know there are zero guarantees that this period of abstinence lasts.  I need to face every day with full resolve. Some days are much easier than others. For this addict it truly is one damn day at a time.  Thanks for reading.
"You know what the most annoying thing about smoking weed for me was? Always thinking about how people perceive me. Afraid to speak my mind because I fear that I’ll hurt someone. I remember in high school I was cocky and kinda arrogant. Weed made me aware of that so I chilled out on the cockiness. But in my opinion I chilled out so much that I became so timid. I feel like that cockiness was my spark and weed made me overthink it too much. 

I’m now on day 71 and finally see my cockiness returning very slowly. I’m no longer trapped inside my mind worried about how people perceive me. Whenever that comes up I’m like wait hold up I don’t give a fuck lol. It feels good. 🤩"
"Today is day 1. I promise that you’ll see my 10 day post in 10 days It’s actually time, just glad I’m doing this while still Young. It would be so easy to never take the fight and waste a lifetime"
"I’ve been sober for 28 days I haven’t smoked weed in 28 days, and I have nobody to tell. If I told my parents, they would be concerned that this was an accomplishment, as they have no idea how severe my use got. If I told my friends, they would invite me to spark one up with them as celebration. As of today, I’ve accomplished my longest sober stretch in the last 2 years, but apart from this subreddit I have nobody to tell."
"I started to think I could never quit. Today I'm ONE WEEK sober!!! Hi guys,

I've followed this community for what feels like forever now. I have tried and told myself I'd quit far too many times to ever count. The number of journal entries I have stating ""this is it!"" is embarrassing, and I really lost faith in myself and my ability to turn things around.

I was the smart girl who had her shit together until I started smoking around the age of 20. Fast forward 10 years: it had stopped being fun a long time ago. It was now serving another purpose, which was masking the ugly, painful feelings that simmered under the surface. I knew I was letting my life waste away, and I couldn't deal with it. I smoked constantly, about 1/8 a day, waking up every few hours throughout the night to smoke 3-4 bowls just so I could fall back asleep. 

I wasn't even living. I was numbing & blocking out not only the negative feelings, but EVERYTHING. Nothing felt good or brought me joy anymore. I stopped writing, making art, reading books etc. and started to become a recluse. I didn't even know who I was anymore.

Eventually the weed just wasn't doing enough for me. I started drinking more. Or I would tell myself I wouldn't smoke weed, just to get drunk and order a weed delivery a few hours later. In those moments, it felt like the only way I could cope with my own existence. 

But here I am. I haven't had weed or alcohol in a week and I'm almost in disbelief. Just wanted to share this win with a community that has helped me to feel like I'm not alone in this.

You aren't alone in this either. None of us are. Like they say over at r/stopdrinking, I will not smoke with you today."
"Things I’ve noticed since quitting weed (1 month) 1. My social anxiety has all but ceased to exist
2. My energy levels are much higher
3. I can run up a flight of stairs without feeling winded (out of breath)
4. I get hungry without needing to smoke 
5. I’m not grouchy when I don’t smoke
6. My mental health is in a much better place 
7. I’m better at video games 
8. I don’t even crave weed
9. I have more money than I know what to do with because I’m not spending $20+ a day on bud 
10. I’m happier than I’ve been in months 
11. My head is clear and I don’t just have “nonsense loops” anymore 
12. People seem to like me more (people I know and strangers alike)
13. I am fulfilled by normal activities


I don’t know how I’ve done it. It’s like my pre frontal cortex finally developed and something in my brain just clicked and somehow after struggling with every-day smoking for years, quitting became easy. I quit both Mary Jane and vaping at the same time and it’s incredible all the benefits I’ve seen in such a short period of time. I believe in every single one of the wonderful people on this sub, you guys can do it!"
Who wants to be my witness? 
"If you're high everyday..... You're not yourself, you're a crappy knock off version. You're maybe 50% of who you could actually be. You've customised your body and mind to need a substance to function. Without it you likely revert to irritable child like behavior.  Nobody as a kid says when I grow up I wanna be a stoner, i wanna exist at about 50% of my full potential, I want to be dependent on weed to be happy, I wanna live in a haze everyday.....sorry to be harsh but maybe it's what you need to hear."
"Hi Leavers👋🏻If you sort posts by new you can see if someone else has just posted what you might be about to so you two can relate together👩🏼‍🤝‍👨🏻Try seeking out unanswered posts to make someone feel seen. They may REALLY appreciate it🥺Don't assume we're all men cos we're not!💅🏻 Thanks!💛 Being semi serious for a moment, I've had posts go unreplied to and I don't care 🤷🏼‍♀️ I seriously don't give a shit, I spout utter pap half the time...😆 but for other people it can be hard. 

We all like to be seen, acknowledged. If you've got the time, look for a post with no replies and if you can relate or offer support give them a moment of your time. Takes a lot of courage to post here for some people. Not me obviously I never shut up 🤷🏼‍♀️ but in the sometimes scary and lonely world of addiction sometimes one comment can brighten the room enough for someone to have hope again. 

By sorting by new instead of what's hot not only may you catch a post while the poster is still online so you can actually almost talk and relate in real time (and they may have just posted the same thing you were going to) but you may catch someone posting who's about to relapse and asking for help. And although it's no one else's responsibility at all, simply encouraging them not to may be enough in that moment of weakness.

This is my last non-check in post don't worry 😆 I'm getting off my soapbox, I now have r/leaves fatigue 😳🥳

Extra obligatory emojis as requested 😘😜

😊😇💁🏼‍♀️👑🙄😏😆

(Day 78.5)

Stay strong everyone 💛

And if you've got this far, yes I have tits 🤭

**ETA 8 hours later: I'm signing out of Reddit now cos my head is battered but compassion is my main point. Male or female. Doesn't matter. The female aspect of my post was probably 5% of the content but apparently what caused the most response... 

We're all humans, we all matter, and we all deserve to be heard.**"
"Today I made a little drawing of my former weed-jar. I've been getting blazed daily for almost three years. This is my third day of not smoking and it's the first time I've made any art in almost a year and it feels great! I'm so thankful I found this sub, it's really given me the push I needed. "
"I’m probably at least twice your age... ...If not three times. And since I can’t be a shining example, let me at least share some hard won wisdom. 

Every time I’ve relapsed, I’ve ended up in the same place. Stuck. Trapped. Lots of ideas, very little action. Disconnected. Out of shape. Unemployed. Lonely.

So much struggle, every day. So much confusion, forgetfulness, exhaustion. The mess. The broken promises. The unreliability. The lost potential.

My brain is damaged, my vision is damaged (can’t see in the dark) my lungs are damaged, my retirement is nonexistent.

This could be your future. I hope it isn’t.

I’ve been crying a lot, lately, about what I missed out on, this life. But I’m gonna try again. I’ve been sober from alcohol for nine years, quit smoking cigarettes a couple months ago. Time to get clean again.

Very glad to have found y’all!

I have my first 24 hours. 🙂"
"Weed creates a problem, and then becomes the perfect medicine for the problem it created. Imagine this,

&#x200B;

One day you wake up from sleep and have a small rash on your arm. Very small.

One of your friends gives you an ointment and tells you to apply it to the rash.

You apply the ointment and the rash disappears.  You are content.

Few days later, the rash is back on your hand. Except its a little bit bigger.  You apply the cream again. Rash is gone.

In a week, the rash is back even bigger and you apply the cream again and it disappears.

You keep doing this until the rash comes back the size of your entire arm.

&#x200B;

Only then, you realize that the ointment was making the rash worse. You stop applying it, and the rash slowly over the next few months disappears.  And never comes back.

&#x200B;

This is what weed addiction really is.  It causes issues and then convinces you that its the cure to them.  Its so insidious.

Replace the ""rash"" with a bad break up, and the ointment with weed.  day 7 lets fucking go.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

edit: Yes guys this is from Allah carr.    I read it there years ago  and thought it would help everyone here."
"Correlation between not smoking and comments like “you look really good” and “your eyes look...brighter” coming from ppl who have no idea about my journey with weed. I’ve been workshopping my relationship to cannabis and have “fallen off” and climbed back on over the course of last few years/ especially since late 2019. Been pretty weed-free for 2020 with a few blips here and there.

My experiments have shown an interesting correlation: I tend to get positive random compliments from people who have no clue about my journey when I haven’t been smoking.

Comments that my skin looks great, that I generally  “look good” etc. But beyond appearance - I also just notice that my interactions are higher quality. People seem to respond better to me on a level that isn’t necessarily verbal. Can’t really explain it.

It’s becoming clear, based on my interactions in the world, that I vibrate higher when not smoking."
"Day 80, ate an edible last night And it was nice for a little bit, that familiar gently sparkling warmth. I went for a lovely run in the spring sun (yes nowadays spring arrives in February).  I felt like, ok this isn’t so bad, I don’t know what the big deal is...

But then the anxiety hit, the fixation and amplification of past regrets. I hadn’t felt that in months. 

Then the zombification of the comedown. The plans I had for the evening drifted away as I wasted time, scrolling through my phone and shuffling around the house. 

And this morning I am SO dull and scatterbrained.   I feel like my skull is packed with cotton candy.  I can’t start my work without distraction. I hadn’t felt this in months. I can’t believe this was a daily reality for me. 

Y’all told me but I didn’t listen. In the moment, I thought I could just have a taste, the downside was a distant memory. It ain’t worth it.  Sobriety is so much better, maybe not as dreamy, but certainly sharper, clearer, more energetic, more vivid, more lifelike! 

I’m not restarting my sobriety count. This is just a blip. I’m not going back."
At day 90 today! And I got to welcome home my twin boys! It hasn’t been easy but each day I stay clean it gets easier and easier! This sub has been a tremendous help and I thank you all! 
"When you start weighing up the pros and cons of whether to use again, it's already too late The brain has an amazing ability to perform any mental gymnastics to justify using again. As soon as you catch yourself debating about whether to use, immediately cut it off and distract yourself with something else. Refuse to even have this discussion with yourself. The decision to stop has been made already -- it doesn't need to be re-considered."
"Spent 11 years straight high off my ass... today is 3 months sober. This isn’t a humble brag, I just want you to know you can do it if you set your mind to it. 

From when I started high school until quite recently I was high just about every single day. I thought it was helping my anxiety and helping me cope with depression, but it was just holding me back. 

If you’re thinking about taking a leave, just know I believe in you. If I can do it, so can you. My biggest tip for someone who’s ready to quit, is don’t force it. You need to hit that bottom, and be completely disgusted with yourself and your herbs. You can get there. If you want support with your break feel free to DM me any time. You will love yourself sober."
"36 hours weed free after the most miserable weekend of my adult life Yesterday I came home from the most miserable weekend of my life. My bf and his “best friend” had quickly planned a camping trip for the three of us, plus the friend’s ex girlfriend. They spent the entire weekend bickering with each other, It was extremely nasty and toxic, culminating in a screaming match fit for /publicfreakouts and them almost actually getting into a physical fight yesterday. I cried every single day this weekend because of their bullshit. We are all stoners, though I have been tapering my weed usage for the last 6 months or so, and am the only one who can admit that it might be addictive or a problem for any of us. 

It’s incredible 1. How much everyone had to smoke to tolerate each other and 2. How nasty and full of rage so-called “mellow stoners” can be. My bfs friend has a total inability to communicate when things are bothering him, just acts like everything is fine, expects people to read his dissatisfaction from his sarcastic tone, and meanwhile he is seething with rage inside from every perceived slight (whether real or imagined), that of course inevitably bursts.

I am just so disgusted with everyone’s behavior. Despite us all being in our 30s-40s, I felt like there was not a single adult on the trip. All the while everything is bandaged over with weed. We will all probably never hang out as a group again and all our friendships have been irreparably harmed. 

Yesterday was a turning point for me. Despite the high stress situation and it being offered to me constantly all day, I didn’t have a single hit of weed. I don’t want this future. I am not like these people. I do not use weed to make myself numb to a horrible situation. I am learning to deal with difficult emotions with a clear sober head."
I want to go into 2020 as “a person who doesn’t smoke weed”. Who else?? 
"Ahhh shit, here we go again "
"Someone gave a bag for free Yesterday after my gig someone gave me a bag of weed for free as a kind gesture for a job well done. I didn't know what it was until smelled it. I was at work so I quickly hid it in my pocket and decided I'd earnt it and would have it when I got home. Then an hour later after mingling with everybody. A friend asked me to go to his for a smoke up. I told him I was quitting and gave the weed to him. He said are you sure? I said yes and instantly I felt proud of myself. I smoked a cig and had a sip of wine which isn't great but, I didn't smoke weed! Day 6!!!!!! Whoooooop!"
"Please don't relapse today, or any other day. It's just not worth it. Stay strong today. "
"ER trip convinced me enough is enough. Long post... sorry. I've tried quitting pot before. Oh, I've tried. I've bagged up my grinders and pieces and fresh bud and thrown them out. I've done it several times. I'd just go buy new stuff a week later, spending even more money. I'd smoke through the flu, making things worse. For the last 8 years I smoked almost every day, even after a double hernia surgery. I've spent all of my 20s in a haze. I have a degree in piano and for 7 years I've wasted all the skills I worked so hard to develop. I have stagnated for 8 years on developing marketable job skills. I have spent 8 years chasing a neverending high and playing video games, and not improving as a person. 

My little sister died last year and she knew me as a pothead. She's the only one in my family who knew what I really was. I have held onto that loss so tightly that I feared ever quitting weed because I thought I needed it to retain my sanity and manage my lifelong hypochondria and anxiety. 

Friday night I wasn't feeling so great and went to bed early. The next morning I smoked a little weed and an hour later my heart began racing and I couldn't breathe. I thought I was having a heart attack. I'm perfectly healthy so I was very scared and went to the ER. I never ever go to the hospital so I didn't even know where to park. The doc told me I likely had an anxiety attack... and diagnosed me with pleurisy. My breath is short, and it's uncomfortable in my chest. It is only mild, but any time I tried smoking last week, I felt the symptoms - it took an ER trip to convince me to stop smoking. 

The last few days have been a nightmare. Although Tylenol is making the pleurisy much better and completely manageable, I am having a hard time adjusting to reality sober. I can't sit down and play video games because I get bored quickly. No weed? Can't sit there for hours playing Animal Crossing and Red Dead 2. Just can't think or focus. I want to be high, but I'm a lazy motherfucker who is still dragging himself out of addiction and can't bring myself to concentrate on active hobbies. I am laying in bed with insane hunger pangs even though I just ate.

I cannot remember the last time I was sober this long. I never want to go to the ER again. I just want the stomach pangs and discomfort to go away, I want my appetite back to normal, I want to have a zest for life again. I want to play the piano again and actually learn to enjoy things without weed again. I cannot enter my 30s living paycheck to paycheck, doing nothing with my life under the illusion that it's fine to just do nothing all fucking day all fucking year long. My best friend just had a kid. I do not want that kid to grow up and be more accomplished than I will be at 50.

I want to be free. I'm on day 3. I realize I'm addicted. I realize I will always be an addict. But I'm not going to be a slave anymore. I'm sick of this shit. It isn't worth it anymore. 

If you read all this... thank you. I just need someone to tell me it's going to get better. I'm going to try to go back to sleep now. If you have any advice... please give it. Sleep and Tylenol and bottles of water are my biggest friends. I just tossed out ALL my paraphernalia, again. Hopefully for the last time. 

I can do this. I know I can.

EDIT: It's the following morning and there's almost 300 upvotes on this and dozens of comments of love and support. This community rules. Thank you so much for the support. Nighttime is dreadful for some reason. I still have to get up and go to work, so I'm actually thankful for this bit of routine, because it will help occupy my mind throughout most of the day. I'll check back in over time. Much love, everyone.

EDIT #2: Wow, a silver award. That's my first ever Reddit award! The love just keeps on flowing... I'm stunned. You all are making day #4 such a warm experience. I hope tonight is easier than last night's, but it may get worse like some of you said. But I know I can get through this with all your help.

EDIT #3: I wish I could respond to all of you individually. I read every single comment and am taking in every bit of advice. I am going to come out on the other side of this a brand new, better version of myself. I will be posting updates over time."
"I Just cant believe it's real, someone wake me up from this dream - 2 WEEKS WITHOUT WEED!!!!!! After a decade of smoking on daily basis I know that maybe its too soon to 'celebrate', but im 27 years old and been smoking on a daily basis since i was 17, i thought it helped me with depression and PTSD after my parents got sick, and eveantually passed away..

It took some time (almost a decade) to understand that weed was holding me back from starting an healthy healing process.

2 weeks ago ive been so fucking depressed that i thought to myself 'weed isnt helping shit!!!'

Today im proud to say that im sober for 2 weeks, and ive never felt better! 

My mind is clearer, my creativity is already back, im enjoying things and even got my precious hobbies back!!!

The first couple of days was really hard, and even now i think about smoking a little joint every fucking day, but the voice of reason reminds me how bad it made me feel. I was on the brink of giving up, and now im full of hope and love!!!!

Everybody here, you can do it too!
Stay strong!!! Life can be so much better for all of us
Thanks for reading!!"
"6 days after 33 years of sobriety This might put things in perspective for some of you. I am 69 years old, started smoking weed when I was 18. I had 33 years of sobriety from all substances. Then a year ago a pot shop opened 2 blocks from my home. I started with tinctures and edibles to ""sleep"" and ""relax"".....pretty quickly it progressed  to smoking. Oh how I had missed that high. 

At first I convinced myself that this time, at this stage in life, it would be a good idea to expand my consciousness.....to experience a new me. (Note, the pot back in 1969 was no where near as potent as nowadays......we were smoking stems and seeds back then). It took a year of smoking for me to really come around to the reality of my situation. I was totally addicted again....after all these years. I had to start over....from day 1. 

I luckily remember all my excellent AA training and know what I need to do. In the absence of  good, face to face meetings, this subreddit has become one of my tools of sobriety. And I know from all those years of sobriety that the number one way to get and stay clean is to help others. I have 6 days....thats 4 more days than someone who is struggling with only 2 days. We have to reach out and help each other. That is how to stay sober. Approach the new comer...they need us. Even if we too are newcomers ourselves. And by helping those who are struggling, we are spending less time worrying about ourselves. 

33 years clean and sober.....addiction is cunning, baffling and powerful. It has infinite patience to wait and kick you in the ass years later.  Once you know you are an addict.....you will always be an addict....but we can be happy, recovering addicts....helping others and making it easier for those who are struggling by sharing our experience, strength and hope. 

I wish you all the best.....if I don't stay sober this time I will drink....and I just don't have the strength  at 69 years of age to go through that nightmare again. 

Take care.....if you think you are not going to make it through today sober....please contact me and I will give you the support I can.  

You can do this.....and you can start over anytime....no matter how many times you have attempted to quit in the past. Recovery is a miracle. But we have to nurture it.....and be kind to one another."
"Was gifted free weed and almost relapsed, sold it and bought food After about 2 weeks clean I was having a rough day, and a friend who knew gave me about 20 bucks worth of weed to help me feel better.  At first I just put it away in a drawer for a rainy day but I started thinking maybe a couple hits today wont hurt, and I almost loaded my pipe and relapsed.  Instead I sold it to my stoner friend and bought some groceries. Many times before I would waste money on weed when I needed other stuff more.. I had several excuses in my head (1 time won't hurt, I had a rough day so I deserve it, I was bored) but I overcame all of it and I'm proud of myself."
"Simple advice given by an Ayahuasca Shaman about weed A few months ago I attended an Ayahuasca ceremony, for numerous reasons; but one of the reasons was to heal myself from the damage weed has caused in my Self and my life. 

The ceremony begins with a blessing and a ritual, and then everyone drinks their first cup of Aya. After about an hour and a half, if anyone wants a second cup, they can go to the Shaman and request a second cup. The Shaman gauges how you're feeling, and determines if you do indeed need that second cup. I went up for a second cup, because I felt comfortable and wanted to deepen the experience. 

Right before he handed me the second cup, he paused and said: ""What are you doing here? What do you want?""

I told him I was there for a few reasons, but as it related to weed I said, ""I'm hoping that Ayahuasca can help heal the damage I believe I've done to my brain from smoking so much cannabis for so long. I feel as if it's caused me to become dim-witted and slow. I've lost my ability to connect with myself and others.""

He handed me the second cup and right before I drank it he said, ""Before you drink that second cup, I want you to think of your situation differently. Instead of being concerned about, and focusing on all the negative things cannabis has brought into your life...simply focus on the positive things she brought into your life while you were together. Thank her for that. And move on.""  

It's a simple, yet powerful message. 

It's akin to having an amicable break up, rather than having a tumultuous, argument and resent-filled break up. 

Thank you, Cannabis, for being my companion during the good times. Thank you for providing me with spiritual insights, creativity, and forcing me to question the status quo. I respect you and appreciate what you provided; but we both know that we are no longer a suitable match. On to bigger and better things - being fully present, engaged and alive in this beautiful existence. "
"That moment when you are stoned on your bed thinking what the fuck am I doing is when you know. At that exact moment, you realise that, yes there is something wrong. Tomorrow will be the day when I go to sleep sober and wake up clear headed and go around enjoy this drug called life.

But then next night you are back at it. The circle continues.

But don't get discouraged.

You will feel low.

You will feel depressed.

You will automatically start rolling.


But then, think about that moment. That moment when, laying there stoned, you felt helpless and shit, and said this is it. Hold on to that feeling, own that feeling. Think about how you never want to feel that way.

And let go.

Just go for a walk. Go, do something that will take your mind off this. 

Slowly you can and will take back control of your life. 


3 months sober and proud.

Edit: 5 months. Wasn't keeping count. Had to check my first post on this sub to confirm. You see once you take yourself out of the equation, and get used to being sober, it becomes a habit.

[Link to my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h9bj37/for_years_i_convinced_myself_i_was_just_a_high/)"
"I thought weed made me creative, 10 days sober and my creative juices are running like a wild fire!! I want to get so many things done with my life now and have actual goals "
"A quote from a philosopher that really spoke to me Marcus Aurelius: ""At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?”

So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?

You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.""

Obviously, this is about getting out of bed. But I feel like it has a lot in common with what we struggle with here. Weed stops us from doing what we need to do. We werent born to simply ""feel nice."" Staying in bed all day, or getting high, are simple, short term pleasures that stop us from obtaining more long lasting goals.

Thoughts on this?"
"Am I the only one who smokes to avoid the pain/shame of being single I haven't really been making much of an effort to avoid weed these days, but it's been about 5-7 days since my last smoke. I've spent each of the past two nights crying harder than I've ever cried before because I've been single for 5 years, and the longing to be with someone is just so intense. Too intense to live with. I don't know what's wrong with me that put me in this situation. I never could have imagined my life turning out like this. Just writing this message is making me feel so fucking lonely and I can feel the tears coming up. The holidays are tough. Life is tough.

&#x200B;

edit: I feel so much less alone now, guys. I was pretty sure I'd end up in bed getting high all day, but I'm not gonna do that any more. I hope to keep hearing from you all, even if I can't respond to everyone. We can all do it, someway somehow <3"
"“Son, there comes a time in a man’s life when you put down the bong and focus on what’s important” Ok, this is just the dad in me talking to the son in me. Not an actual conversation that happened lol. Look, I’ve had a lot of fun in my life. I’ve smoked weed for a little over a decade and had many forgotten unforgettable moments. Kind of beautiful really, the level of companionship that a shared joint can bring. So I’ll miss that, and I think there will be some mourning involved in acknowledging that that phase is passing. But I’m technically in my late 20’s now. I want to start a family and lean into my potential and be financially secure. I can’t do that when I’m up in the clouds a few times a week. I think, ultimately, the most concerning side effect of marijuana is that it makes you content with living your average life. Yes there are benefits, of course, and many lessons the plant has to teach, but it’s a double edged sword and it can’t be held on forever without hurting your potential. I’ve attempted a few times to quit, but this time feels different."
"I’m proud of myself. I never thought I’d make it to 6 months, but here I am :) "
"Yesterday I decided to quit, today being my 1st day after 22yrs . I just grabbed a snickers from a lady at work, this is a sign. "
"3 years sober today. What I’ve learned. I smoked from 18 to 24. This is the realization that made me quit: I’ll never be the best version of myself if I’m high. Once I accepted that, quitting was easy. Addiction is a mindset problem. There may be some physical symptoms but the truth is that you are smoking for a psychological reason. Most people love to have an excuse for their short comings. You failed that test because you were high, you didn't get that girl's number because you were high, etc. That's what you tell yourself and your friends.

&#x200B;

When you become sober you have to start to blame yourself for everything and that's hard to do. In the first year of being sober I was desperate to blame other things, I would convince myself that I was sick or that my situation was someone else's fault. I went to the doctor like 5-6 times that year. But finally I realized that this was just another mindset problem. Be very careful not to develop another outlet for your excuses while finding sobriety because that will lead you down another destructive path. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*The amazing thing is that when you start to blame yourself for your problems you start to give yourself the power to change. Its hard in the beginning but after a year your confidence doubles and it doubles again the year after that. So now 3 years sober, I don't even think about weed anymore. I don’t even care. I don’t need it. And by the way, life is 10 times better now than when I was smoking. 

&#x200B;

If you are here on r/leaves you've already started to make the right decision. Quitting isn't easy but its a process and it happens over time. It's extremely important to make a commitment to bettering yourself; you need to start setting goals and executing instead of quitting and expecting good things to happen. For the first few months I suggest going easy on yourself, you're going to be very vulnerable. If you want to watch TV, watch TV, if you want a cookie, have a cookie. Don't pitty yourself but instead grow from the pain. Spend less time with your friends that aren't motivated or hungry for success, they probably won't understand what you're trying to accomplish here. 

&#x200B;

Have a dream. One thing that comes with having more confidence is that you start to believe that you can achieve more and more. If you have a dream that you previously thought was unattainable, it might not seem so far fetched now. Start working towards that. I started by setting myself a ridiculous goal and just grinding towards it to see what would happen (when I say ridiculous I really mean pie in the sky ridiculous). Well 2 years in and I'm closer than I thought I would be to my dream becoming a reality, the results have been unexpected and incredible.

&#x200B;

I've become fluent in Korean, I've learned to juggle, I've ran marathons, I've learned to code well in at least 5 languages, I've launched a business and several side projects, met way more girls and more. The more you achieve the more you will achieve and it compounds every year. Who knows where I will be in the next 2 years but I can promise you I'll be making big moves. THAT is what keeps me excited every day and seeing myself grow has been a hugely rewarding experience.

&#x200B;

Smoking weed now just seems like such a waste of time and health now. I regret those 6 years that I smoked because if I had put in work 24/7 instead I would probably own an island by now. Look, the first few months are hard, you're going to have to break yourself down and build yourself back up. But once that happens I promise you won't ever relapse again.

&#x200B;

Just remember, you have the power to do anything you want. The unfortunate thing is that probably only 1 in 100 who read this will understand and start trying to live better. I told myself that I would post a message like this some day to pass on what I have learned. I didn't know when but 3 years sober seems like the right time. If I can give at least one person an epiphany then its been worth it.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I'm not saying everything is perfect for me now, I still have some struggles and areas on which I want to improve. But all in all I am MILES ahead of where I was. To be honest, I'm not even close to the same person I was 3 years ago. Totally different. And I know that you are probably going through some horrible situation now and believe me I've been there before too. We are all human. But if not now, when? And if not us, who?

&#x200B;

Stay strong. Stay safe. Never stop. Never drop.

모두 제일 좋다

EDIT:

Thanks for reading! If this post made you feel better, that really makes me happy. This is just to follow-up  and answer a few questions. 

I haven’t experimented with other drugs. I drink a few times a year socially, nothing too excessive.

I learned to code online and through friends.

I would say I started to feel normal again after about 1 year. I smoked regularly for 5 years though, someone who smoked for 20+ years would probably take longer. 

Theres going to be some bad days in the first 3 months but its nothing you can’t handle. Just do whatever you can to keep yourself positive. Watch a disney movie, listen to only upbeat music, whatever. It doesn’t matter, just avoid negativity at all costs. Seriously. 

I’m not saying that my issue was the same as yours but in my opinion the majority of people who have an addiction problem with weed have a fear of failure which is rooted in low self-esteem (you might not even realize it though). Being stoned is a great excuse for failing and it feels good too. Being high is a safe place. If your blazed out of your mind then you can’t be expected to do anything really. And if you keep yourself in a state where you can’t execute then you can’t fail. You can’t win either though.

It took me a long time to realize this. Smoking weed wasn’t the problem. It was a symptom of the problem. Get to the root of the issue. 

Blaming yourself is actually a really powerful tool. Try to implement it as much as you can. Even when other people make mistakes, see what you could have done in that situation. Don’t go overboard but trust me, do it for a year and watch how powerful you become. 

The other key for me was to set goals and complete them. I started by having a list of easy things, clean my room, make a sandwich, etc. And got used to crossing things off. Every item you cross off the list increases your self confidence a bit. Bigger items yield bigger boosts. Keep adding items onto your list and make them gradually harder. Make it your mission to execute things every day. Every goal you complete makes you better. I’ve been doing it for 2 years and now I’m addicted to completing goals. 

Also, people used to suggest that I get on medication or see a psychologist but I didn’t feel that was the answer for me . You might be different I don’t know, but I suggest you don’t immediately try those and instead see what you can do on your own. You got yourself into this situation, you can probably get yourself out. 

Let me just finish by saying that weed is a dead end. You already know this. When I said that my realization made quitting easy, what I really meant was it made it inevitable. I had to make a decision.  If I wanted to start achieving things, quitting was the only option. So then the question became: quit now or later? The answer to that was easy. 

You’ve already decided you want to quit, thats why you’re here. I would urge you to follow through. I chose to post on this forum because I know you guys are the ones that want to improve. I wouldn’t say any of this to the stoners I used to know. Life really is a lot better on the other side. Hope this helped."
"ONE YEAR SOBER TODAY Holy shit. One year and not a single puff of weed. I never thought this day would be possible. I knew for a long time that I needed to stop smoking, but I was afraid. I was stuck. I felt like a slave to weed. It was no longer my friend. It was an insidious enemy. I am free of that prison now. I get to choose how I want to spend my time now. I get to have energy and money and healthy food and a clean apartment. I get to be reliable for my friends and my obligations. I get to shower and brush myself instead of passing out in bed. Those are all things that I didn’t have by the end of my using. Happiness consists of genuine interest in your daily activities. And I can say that today, I am happy. I take joy in my life. I no longer dread waking up anymore. Freedom is possible. Sobriety is possible. I didn’t do this alone though. Thank you to this subreddit. Thank you for the posts and comments. I used to read this subreddit WHILE getting high. Now I can read it and inspire others. Love u all"
"One whole month! Replaced my weed habit with a old one, reading. This is the first time I’m finishing a book in over 2 years! "
"1 year off weed, alcohol, and other drugs I’m so grateful to be alive. Honestly, I thought that once I quit, that things would get better but it wasn’t exactly like that. I would still get depressed for months. I learned that quitting doesn’t solve your problems, but it does mean that drugs won’t make your problems worse. 

Getting and being better requires just as much work as staying sober. Life doesn’t just take off, but I’m grateful to stay afloat despite the troubles."
"Just Slept Today I just slept today. I don't care. I'm gonna have the symptoms of depression some days. I'm gonna think nothing good is coming my way. I'm going to cry because pain and trauma I used weed to suppress will come to the surface when I lay in bed at 2pm, with the window open and nothing but the wind and the birds keeping me company. 

I'm 31, almost 32. Life got better when I quit weed. Lost my girlfriend to a car accident almost 2 years ago and haven't really recovered. She was my light. I've been self-medicating with pot, but it doesn't help.

So yeah, some days I'm just going to lay in bed. Some days I'll clean my house and go to the gym. Recovery sucks, especially in quarantine. Frankly, I don't even know who I am. I've been high for 13 years now: 18-31. I won't smoke because I don't want to anymore. I miss my girlfriend still. I might waste a day in bed, but I won't get high.

Edit: Thank you all very much for the overwhelming response. Everyone in my life seems to think I should be over my girlfriend's accident and refuses to internalize that I suffer from addiction even though I've told all of them many times. 

Also, I am taking medication for depression and anxiety. It helps. Also I've started lap swimming for exercise which helps a lot, too. 

If anything, I hope my post helped you all go easier on yourselves. I see it often on this sub, and I do it too, where I feel like every day needs to be some impractical massive step forward in well-being and self-improvement. Allow a day to suck, and don't beat yourself up for not living up to the standards of our very sick, often sociopathic societal expectations. 

I have to remind myself every day, and hopefully you can do it to: no matter how you feel, smoking will make it worse. Accept your emotions, you probably needed to process them throughout your time smoking anyway, and just keep going. Thank you all."
"A MONTH I MADE IT A FREAKIN MONTH I’M SO PROUD OF MYSELF, I CAN’T BELIEVE I MADE IT TO AN ENTIRE MONTH !!!!! 

it’s been hard, i’ve had a few cravings within the past week but i soldiered through it and said ‘NO’ and didn’t smoke. 

things i’ve noticed :

• i can remember things. 

• i’m more productive. 

• i like to cook more and my appetite has increased to where i’m eating 3+ meals a day. 

• i’m more self aware. 

• my hair is growing and actually darkened back to its natural color (dark, dark brown / black). 

• mood swings. 

• dental health has been a complete 180. 

• i’ve picked up some of my hobbies again, including painting, playing my nintendo, etc. i haven’t picked up reading again but i hope to get there. 

i also want to say that i’m proud of you all too, whether you’re going strong or you relapsed. at least you’re trying and even though you may not succeed the first time, YOU ARE WORKING TO BETTER YOURSELF. 

update coming next week, thank you all for your support ❤️"
"Got Heroin out of my life, weed is next I have been clean from all opiates for 16 months,  and I can confidently say after over 5 years on and off that I genuinely don’t crave it anymore. I associate it with death now. I never stopped smoking weed though. The idea that it was helping me “cope” was a lie I continued to tell myself for a long time. Weed doesn’t serve me anymore, it’s just a memory of a what I thought was a happier me. Genuine positive effects are long gone. Here’s to Day 1!"
"Today i am 4 months sober and my life has turned upside down. I first noticed when i was laying in my bed, ready to sleep that today is 4 months since i last smoked weed.

Back then all i did was sitting on my computer day in, day out. Doing absolutely nothing with my life. I met with some friends ocasionally to smoke some more weed, since that was what we had in common. A waste of my life. But at the time i really didnt knew better. It was like i already had given up on my future, my dreams, my family. It was a vicious circle of feeling bad = smoking more.

4 months ago i had a dream. A dream i will never forget. The first dream in many years. I usually never dream when i have smoked weed. But this time i did. I have a son. 1 year old at the time of my dream. He was the one present in my dream. He told me to stop. Or else him and mom would leave me. I woke up in tears and was so confused about the whole situation. Specially because i know my boy cant “speak” yet, and it was like i heard his true voice for the first time. I stood up, took all my weed, and flushed it down the toilet. I never looked back.

Today i have the best relationship with my boy, and my girlfriend. I now have my own business producing musicvideoes and commercials. I love it! My dream. A dream since i was 9 years old and got my first camera in a present from my dad.
I feel like i matter to people now. It is truly strong and a wonderful feeling. 

I know YOU can do it as well! 

Stop smoking and do what you dream of doing. 


Im so sorry for my rubbish english. I hope it all made sense. 

Have a fantastic day!"
My grandma asked me “are you smoking in there” the other day and I was able to say no without lying 😊😭 
Woo! 
"You know those people who said exercise helps? They're right. I have been struggling so hard to not smoke during the pandemic. I've just felt so....blah, grumpy, lethargic, and not my usual self. So, I justified smoking several times a week, even though I really don't want to, and in the past I've let cannabis CONSUME me, so I have to be super careful. Well, I exercised today and yesterday, and my cravings were GONE! My mood was lifted, and I was no longer wishing I was high to get through the day. I just felt REALLY GOOD, which was a huge change from the day before. I'm going to keep it up, because this is awesome. Just thought I'd share!"
"Dog/Best Friend a Man Could Ever Have Just Died. Please Give Me Courage to Not Smoke and Drink Myself into Oblivion Cassidy was her name. Had her since first grade (I'm 21). She was the best dog. Everyone says their dog is the best, but even my friends that had dogs agreed she was something special. Friends that had a fear of dogs said she was the only dog they weren't afraid of. She was getting old, but last night she wouldn't come inside and this morning she was having seizures. I don't live at home anymore. My mom called me and put me on speakerphone and she died right after I told her I love her and I hope she isn't in too much pain. We had a very strong bond. I liked her more than most humans. I don't want to smoke today. I don't want to drink today. I finally feel like I am kicking my habit for good. It has been 17 days. I've gone longer before, but this time seems real. It has been such a strong coping mechanism in the past when my sister and friend died. Help me out y'all.

Edit: Thank you all for such kind, encouraging words. I will keep up my streak. I wrote a poem for Cassidy. Might make it into a song eventually. For those who recommend crying, don't you worry, I've been a sobbing mess throughout the day.

"I just realized why I'm not feeling the satisfaction of quitting I'd hope I'd have by now (day 107) I spent most of my life from ages 14-20 high. I barely had friends and my grades were dropping. Last year, I got some bad news about something personal, so smoking the feelings away felt like the best way to deal with that. 

I quit weed right before the beginning of my junior year of college, which was 107 days ago. If you had asked me what I think I'd feel like after 100+ days being sober, I couldn't even tell you because that's unimaginable. Last year, going 4 days without weed was a rare occasion & accomplishment. 

All around, I'm a better version of me than my old sedentary-baked-potato self. I don't think about weed nearly as much anymore. But still...there's this feeling of achievement that I'd thought I'd have by now, and I don't. This made me feel very discouraged throughout the 107 day (so far) process. 

Last year, I had one basic daily routine: wake up, go to class (or don't), eat, do some homework, smoke, eat again, watch tv, go to bed, repeat. If I was feeling social, I'd ask my roommate to smoke with me. I was failing a class and I was avoiding all the problems that were happening in my life. 

Sometimes when I got high, I'd lay on the shower floor for a long time. Now I've been taking very short showers to save time/water. But I have a cold right now, so earlier today I figured I'd chill in the steamy shower for a bit. While I was letting the water fall on my chest, I felt weirdly nostalgic. For a few minutes, I felt like last-year me laying on the shower floor. And in a way, I felt jealous of her...because she was *comfortable*. She was okay with the fact that she was literally doing nothing all day. 

Then, I had a shower thought (literally). I realized why I don't feel ""achieved."" Because I am achiev**ing**. I am go**ing** through an extreme process of change. I'm becom**ing** familiar with the true, sober version of me. I haven't made too many friends, but I am try**ing**. I'm not getting amazing grades, but I'm study**ing.** Hardest of all, I am cop**ing** with my feelings. 

Point is, that ""achievement/satisfaction/whatever"" I was hoping to feel after 100+ days is never going to come, because I am never going to stop changing. If I hadn't begun my process of change, I'd be 107 days behind from who I am now, and I am currently years behind from who I will be one day. Sitting on the shower floor reminded me of my comfort zone that I no longer have anymore. I quit weed because I was not okay with the fact that I was okay doing nothing. I may be far from who I want to be, but at least I'm doing something to get there."
"Being addicted to weed is like pressing the pause button on your life while time keeps running. Only to find out later that you pressed that button for years and you'll never get that time back again. This thought suddenly popped up while sitting here, high as fuck, on a bench all alone outside. I have tried to quit for years and now time really starts counting.

I lost friends, girlfriends and family who died, and it just passed by in a fraction of a second, while feeling numb the whole time. Not being capable of seeing your family on a regular basis. Suddenly they're gone and you realize that you've spend that whole time high and just threw time away. And most of all: all those years of potential and developing yourself dissapeared and you just lag behind and stood still, while everyone and everything moved on.

Personal story:

I'm 22, started at 16. OCD from childhood came back hard by smoking that I basically became a hermit.

My OCD is about unlucky numbers and rituals, freaking out of numbers of the month (roughly 2/3 of the month are ""unlucky days'' to quit). Put it simple: if I quit on those days I feel anxious, my OCD literally thinks that someone could die/I'd not reach my goals if I quit on an ''unlucky day''. Even on the ""normal""  days I can't quit because then ''I'd avoid beating my OCD"". On top of that I also have tinnitus..

I try to quit literally everyday with cigs and weed and every morning the anxiety starts to kick in hard. It got to the point I dropped out of college, and now spend my evenings outside all alone with weed and a beer. Hell, I even want to quit today but my sister will quit smoking in two days and so I can't quit because I don't want to associate ""my quit with hers''. This provokes tremendous anxiety to me, strangely.. OCD always finds a way..

It even got to the point I stole money from my dad just to get weed, ride the bike 50 km for a gram. Got kicked out for a while.. I have basically become pathetic.

It all started with a suicide attempt at 16, from then on I started sleeping 14 hours a day and throwing years of life away. Before anyone asks, I get professional help, but I just don't feel understood by anyone, I always felt different like I didn't fit in. It's so weird that my OCD is mixed with my addictions. I want to quit when everything is perfect but that will sadly never happen. 

I managed to quit 3 times for a couple of weeks and felt like a different person, it's just that this OCD holds me as a prisoner and keeps making me lose so much time and energy..

Just one more thing: you guys are one of the greatest recovery subreddits. Comments are always so well thought and supportive."
"150 days today. Doing well, but. . . . . . . . .. . 150 days without weed today after a 26 year smoking habit. Doing well, in fact, I've seen measurable improvements in all aspects of my life -- mentally, physically, and spiritually. My creativity is back. I'm writing again, reading, running, doing yoga, meditating, eating well, teaching myself to play banjo, building things in my little woodshop. My relationship with my wife and kids is also better than ever because I'm truly present. My wife deserves a sober, present husband. My kids deserve a sober, present dad, which is something I never had growing up. Quitting was one of the most difficult and best decisions of my life, no doubt.......

I'm currently in a bit of a heavy mood, though, which is what brought me here to check in. I  guess I'm still trying to fully come to terms with the idea that I will never toke again. . .that I will never feel the euphoric feeling of filling my lungs with that warm smoke ever again. . .that I will never sit by a campfire again with my best friend and share a joint and good conversation. It's the social aspect - the ritual of it that I miss the most. The culture behind this drug is so deeply ingrained into my psyche - into my identity, even. There's a real, palpable grief that comes with giving this up - like losing a loved one..............

So, 150 days, I've been to this stage before, and beyond, a few times, actually. The novel excitement of early sobriety has come and gone -- that ""pink cloud"" has blown away. I knew from previous experiences that this would happen, so I'm not surprised by it. It is around this point where I would usually convince myself that ""next time will be different"" - that now ""I can moderate my use"". Not this time though! I have to remind myself that I'm romanticizing the idea of smoking. I have to remind myself that I'm longing for a skewed version of the past that never really existed.  I have to remember that the thought of smoking is far better than the aftermath realities of the relapse high. I have to remember how this drug dulls my intellect, wrecks my short-term memory, damages my lungs, disrupts my mental equilibrium, interferes with my dopamine uptake system, drains my bank account, makes me selfish, and jacks up my priorities. I have to remember that, while it may feel good in the moment, it always leaves me feeling empty and unfulfilled. I have to remember that once I start, I can't get enough of it. I have to remember how it takes over my life. I have to remind myself that consuming this drug comes at the cost of becoming consumed by it. I have to remind myself that to gain an ounce of fleeting, inauthentic happiness through smoking now is to steal a ton of lasting, authentic happiness from my future sober self. I have to fully acknowledge the fact that numbing myself with this drug will only continue to delay my ability to fully address the deep-seated reasons why I feel the need to habitually numb myself in the first place.  I have to remind myself that it's so overrated and simply not worth it..............................

Stay strong leavers!"
"Something that came into my mind while I was high over a week ago: ""You're in no position to decide whether or not you should be high all the time, when you're high all the time.""

That was the last time I smoked. In the days that have followed I have:

-Attended inspections for places to rent and had a return contact on an application. I've lived with my Mum since seperating from my partner of 12 years, treating my depression with weed and doing nothing to fix my situation.

-Cleaned and organised everything within my limited space, my room, my car and workspace. Allowing me to feel in control of what I have left.

-Actually enjoyed my downtime and taking genuine interest in my hobbies.

-Woken up every day feeling prepared for my responsibilities, not bracing myself for them.

When I was high by myself, I would lie to myself. It isn't who I am and it isn't who you are. Listen to that voice, listen to your gut, it's you, trying to make contact through the thick haze.

Thanks for reading."
"You are delaying your ONE life... stop the fucking bullshit The best thing I’ve done for myself was put the devils lettuce down... god , looking back, I’m so disappointed I even began this fucking habit.. it doesn’t do ANYTHING POSITIVE for you and does a TON of damage (of course I am referring to people who are simply hooked, WITHOUT any medical conditions) ... sure it doesn’t kill you , but it affects the most important thing, the thing that dictates your life , the thing that NEEDS to function at its highest capacity to have the life you want, your fucking MIND..... I’ve been off it for 20 days and my god I have 0 interest in going back.. why the fuck would I want to go backwards in life ? Life is so short , you have to make MOVES to get shit done, and all weed did was get in the WAY of me trying to get shit done... look, I know weed isn’t the worst of drugs, but if you are on this fucking reddit page, that means weed is affecting YOUR life and deep down YOU know it.. you know if you stop this habit your life will be better 10 fold. And believe me it will... so do your intuition and soul a favor and listen to it... stop the fucking bullshit excuses..."
"Today is my 3rd day without smoking weed from almost 4 years of daily (ab)use and i've felt things i had forgotten i could feel. I know is not much, but a month ago i couldn't even fathom spending a day without weed. But the panic attacks and paranoia were out of control. I completely forgot what was like to be sober. And i know 3 days is nothing, i don't want a pat in the back or anything like that. Just wanted to share that is not as bad as it seems and is completely possible to achieve. The road to recovery awaits!"
"How I know I can’t “moderately smoke” 1. It has never worked out before. There’s zero evidence to suggest it would be OK now. In fact, I am certain it won’t. 

2. I would put so much effort into moderating and controlling and I would spend all this energy and stress thinking about it, to the point where it eclipses the benefits. It’s honestly easier to just remove weed from the equation altogether, rather than trying to make it fit. 

3. I love the feeling of weed so much that I don’t even know what moderate use looks like. I can’t even imagine it now. Nights only? I’ll miss wake and bake. Weekends only? There goes my weekend and personal life. 1 joint a week? I’d be pissed the other 6 days, waiting for the next one. And in 5 minutes it will become daily, then hourly. 

Honestly, I have failed spectacularly at moderation. And I am doing pretty good at recovery. I think I would rather stick it out, rather than strike another deal with the devil."
"Yeah, get serious about your life. Discipline is your best friend, without it you will never succeed at anything. Hey guys, It's been a little over a month since I smoked my last joint.

Biggest thing is I got more serious about my life and my goals. Instead of postponing I started acting towards them. I got a job now after being unemployed for over 7 months. I thought weed made me feel free while in reality it was all illusions. I was living in a self-imposed prison. I feel kinda proud about the good steps I'm taking and I am also sleeping better. 

Any tips?

Yeah, get serious about your life. Discipline is your best friend, without it you will never succeed at anything. 

Life is hard guys, deal with it.

,Much Peace and strength to all of us"
"Now is the perfect time to NOT smoke – regain a clear mind and clear lungs! (Corona virus) You don't need the paranoia.

You don't need a clouded head.

You don't need to be in a daze.

You don't need dirty lungs that you'll have to cough and hack to clear out.

You don't need to puff and pass to other people who may be unwitting carriers.


Now is the time to let our minds and lungs clear out. 


You need to be alert.

You need to let your lungs heal.

You need to not worry every time you feel the need to cough.


(Not trying to lecture anyone, I've been telling myself these things as well.)"
"To me weed works as the opposite of the drug from Limitless, creating consolidated mediocrity. The range of all possible activities and brainpower available to me narrows down to a cycle of eating junkfood and playing video games or bingeing TV shows that I won't remember. Day 2 for the Nth time but hopefully breaking the cycle for good."
"Found weed in my dream and I didn’t smoke it, just threw it away. Two full bags too. Still it makes me wonder...what’s with the random weed dream?"
"Didn't smoke when my stoner friends showed up for our weekly weed and monopoly night This post is just to share my progress with someone. Its been less than a week of waking up with cold sweats, being nauseous and having serious cravings. I knew it would be hard when my friends, who are as regular smokers as I used to be, showed up to our weekly board game night where we usually indulge stupid amounts of pot. This time however I simply explained to them that I quit and they were super supportive. I even rolled the joints for them, went out to the balcony to accompany everyone but only smoked a cigarette myself. I had a beer to balance the scale, but that was it. It might seem like a small thing, and it probably is, but for the first time in half a decade I managed to do what I thought was impossible, which is largely thanks to this beautiful community. Thank you guys for everything you've taught me, and I truly wish you all the best with getting/staying sober. Take care of yourselves ❤️"
"Its not much, but I went my first full day and night sober in 3 years! I slept like shit but I did it! Now I'm hoping i can maintain this momentum!"
"If you haven’t tried it yet, replace any addiction with physical exercise. I quit the trees and locked myself into a gym membership for year. Exercise gets you high, and keeps you healthy. Game changer. I’ve quit before. It was 90 days of boredom and being numb. This time, I went to the gym. It makes quitting 100% more bearable and enjoyable. And I use to talk shit about gyms or people who work out. Give it a shot. I read posts like this for years trying to quit all my addictions before I gave it a shot. Was nervous too. Happy to answer anyone’s questions about how to make it a reality if you have mental blocks."
"Smoked after 213 days. To anyone considering going back, read this. 213 days ago was the last time I had smoked weed until tonight. In the past three weeks I slowly but surely got back into the mentality of “ill just try it once to see”, romanticizing the hell out of it. 

And within 5 minutes, I was filled with regret. Not only because of the fact that I broke by streak, but because it was very far from enjoyable and not at all what I expected it to be. It made me realize I love having a clear mind, and it may be tough to realize at times just how precious being sober is but I really do believe it’s better than any drug. Some of you might be out there considering going back very heavily, weighing out the reasons, but I promise it’s not worth it. I didn’t even smoke that much and was left feeling extremely antisocial and self conscious, forgetting what was being talked about/what I was going to say, feeling plain stupid, and unable to keep track of the conversations that were being held. 

I think it’s gotten to a point where my body has just been there and done that. It’s not special to me any more. To all those of you out there reading this, I promise you that you will grow to like being sober and having a clear mind, you just have to persevere and trust not only the process, but also yourself fully at all times. Once you see it, weed is nowhere near as fun as it used to be, and is a waste of an opportunity to be sober and truly capture and embrace whatever moment you are in. The idea that it will make you feel good is nothing but an illusion because either you’ll regret it later or right away. 

In a way I’m actually glad I smoked, because I now truly see that my body is over weed. Smoking over 2,000 times made it become old and bland. I promise to every single one of you that the grass is greener on the other side, and that most importantly, you can do it. Have faith in yourself. Appreciate having a clear mind and being sober because it truly is precious. 

Thanks for reading this. If there’s even one person out there I can convince not to smoke, I’ll be more than happy. Take care and be the best version of yourselves that you can be."
"Watching my husbands stoner buddies reminded me why I’m holding strong - 81 days sober- although the temptation still lingered This isolation with my two super active kids has been a challenge and a half. I hadn’t had too many cravings the past couple weeks but the urge has been strong the last couple days. You know, get stoned and spring clean. Get stoned watch a kids movie. Get stoned and be comfortable with this chaotic world. 
Last night my husbands buddies came over. Eyes cashed out, and that “hu hu hu” stoner laugh. Watching them pig out on dinner then starting passing out reminded me why I’m sober. My kids deserve better than that. When they asked if I wanted to join in a toke, they were surprised I’m still sober. But then again, I can’t blame them. I was an all day, everyday productive pothead. But the key word is was. Sober 2020 regardless of what happens in the world."
"They know All I can do is sit back and chuckle. Moments before I was in disbelief. My mom comes into my room and asks how's it going. I said I'm cool (at my desk working remotely). She asked me when I'm going to discuss what I'm going through with her. Long story short she knew when I was smoking, she knew when I quit. She knew when I slipped and now she sees I'm miserable and suspects I'm quitting again.
She's like, your old apartment smelt like weed. When you moved home I don't know what you were smoking cause it didn't smell (dabs) but I know you were getting high. I was shocked and immediately started to cry.
She said she knows I'm private and wanted to give me space but she thinks it's time to talk about it.
You guys who are fortunate to have loved ones who care.... They really do care. Life happens, they just want you happy and healthy.
I think my journey will be easier now I have her support and I can talk to her about my cravings etc."
Today is 3 months 100% smoke free. I just got accepted into college. Ive accomplished more in the last 3 months than i have in the last 5 years since i graduated high school. Unreal. I feel so alive.
"Reminder: Your brain chemicals need time to reset - weed didn’t make you more productive, or fix your anxiety or depression. Friends - I know how hard it can be to wake up with the anxiety, the low mood, the lack of motivation. 

I know the first thought when feeling these things is something like “wow if I smoke I am so much more productive” or whatever — I’m here to remind you that is a false choice.

We’ve been flooding our brain with an influx of chemicals e.g dopamine, and it’s going to take time for our brains to adjust to a normal level again. 

Trust the process - trust your body’s ability to heal itself. It will get better. Stay strong."
"Just hit 4 years weed free. Feeling sentimental. Yesterday marked 4 years since the last time I got high. I wish I knew about this community when I first quit, because I used to spend entire days doing nothing but getting stoned and browsing r/trees. I was so positive that weed wasn't addictive (""not habit-forming"" is what everyone says) that I watched my life fall apart and couldn't identify that the problem was my using until it was almost too late. Flunked out of college, got back in, flunked out again. Ghosted every employer I had. Stole thousands of dollars from my parents, always promising to pay it back.

I smoked all day, every day. I was incapable of facing my day without being stoned. The worst part of my day was the split second between waking up and reaching for my weed, because that was the only time I had to face my actual feelings and emotions about how much of a mess my life had become. I moved back in with my parents and quit cold turkey. The nightmares, the night sweats, the panic attacks all came with withdrawal. I also had really bad diarrhea, which I now know happens to other people too. I spent a few months living with my parents, not responding to any messages from friends asking how I was doing, and I finally got so desperately suicidal that I was afraid of what I would do if I couldn't get high, so I asked my parents to send me to rehab.  


I had no intention of staying sober after rehab. I was just there to figure out my depression, and maybe find some tricks for smoking less. I used to be a destructive drinker, and I knew I wasn't going back to that, so I saw my smoking as a necessary harm reduction to keep me from blacking out and really hurting people. Maybe I could go to some AA meetings and pick up some wisdom from people who'd been through worse shit than me.

I know twelve step isn't for everyone, and I really didn't like it at first. I couldn't get past the God stuff. I felt like a fly on the wall at AA meetings, because even though I might have drank alcoholically in college, I didn't stay up at night thinking about getting drunk. I fantasized about when I'd get high again.

Then, by sheer luck, the drug guy at my rehab told me there was a Marijuana Anonymous meeting within walking distance of the rehab residence. He told me it was a small group, one of only two in my state, but it was right there. A lot of twelve steppers would call this a ""godshot"" or some shit like that, but I don't see it that way. I just really fucking lucked out.

My first MA meeting was a revelation. A lot like finding out this community existed probably was for a lot of you. It turned out I wasn't insane. I heard my exact story told back to me from people I had nothing else in common with. Things that were private sources of shame for me became shared experiences. I thought I was the only person in the world who played games with his stash, setting rules about when I was allowed to get high and inevitably breaking them. 

So I kept going. Still wouldn't say ""I'm (name), and I'm a marijuana addict"" because I wasn't ready to admit that. Just ""(Name), and I'm a stoner"" at first. Then I got closer with people in the program and started working with a sponsor. A dude about my age who seemingly lost everything, and picked it back up. 

My life got better. I stayed in the city where my rehab was. I finished my last 4 college classes here and transferred them back to my old school and graduated. I held down the same job for three years until Covid hit, the longest I'd kept a job before that was maybe six months.

I've spent the last four years with varying levels of commitment to the program, sometimes going to two meetings a week, sometimes not going for months. Since the pandemic hit all the meetings have been on Zoom, which makes it easy for me to hit multiple meetings a day. I work an agnostic program with an agnostic sponsor, and I sponsor two guys. Since my state legalized in January, the rooms have exploded with newcomers and we need all the help we can get. 

It matters so much to me that people understand some of us are not wired to smoke casually. The weed is so potent now, and for some people like us, it just hits the perfect spot of euphoria and detachment. If weed affected all my friends the way it affected me, they would have had to quit too. It makes me furious that people are still suffering out there under this idea that their habit or addiction isn't taken seriously, and I want to do everything I can to break that silence. 

I'm so glad you guys exist, and my DMs are open if anyone wants to talk. <3"
"[Day 360] Just got accepted into Med School; almost threw away one year of sobriety. Hey guys I am typing this on mobile so apologies if I make some typos. 

I made a few posts here quite a while ago about my story, why I quit and little updates during the first few months without weed. I just wanted to share with you guys that today I got the confirmation that I got accepted into med school and also that I have my 1 year anniversary coming up. Honestly, months 1-11 were surprisingly easy. I barely had any cravings and sobriety quickly became the new normal. 

In July I took the entrance exam for medical university here in Austria after studying really hard for 3 months straight. Honestly, after the exam I had the horrible feeling that I fucked it up and soon after my self destructive tendencies came up again. I began drinking beer on my own and playing video games all day. After a week of that I went back to my home city to spend some time with my mum, my cats and my girlfriend. While I was there I also began hanging out with my deadbeat stoner friend again who also was my hookup back in the stoner days. He was ripping his disgusting bong, weed mixed with rolling tobacco, while I was sipping beer and watching him cough up half a lung after every hit before he slipped into the somnolent haze that is the marijuana high.


After a few days of saying no and declining his offers of smoking, eventually I caved and when he told me he was gonna go pick up I pitched in with a 20. Honestly, I felt wrong and bad about it while I said it and while I was waiting for him to return. Deep down I didn't really want to get high again. Deep down I really didn't want to disappoint my girlfriend who had been so supportive and proud of me quitting. Yet I said nothing.

When he came back, me and him had a little falling out. He was with some friend of his and I think he wanted to show to his friend that he could boss me around or belittle me or something. He was high as a kite and trying to play some mind games with me. 
After a minute or two of arguing I said fuck this, I'm out and went back home. I let him keep the 20 bag and just walked home. 

On the way home I felt so, so happy I didn't partake. I felt really reaffirmed in my decision to abstain and also thankful that he decided to be a petty dick that day because if he hadn't I would have definitely relapsed.

So today I got the email that I passed, finishing 71st out of 5000 people, and on Friday I will go to the university and officially enlist.
After years of fucking around and achieving nothing of substance except substance abuse I finally have a clear goal and career path in front of me and that is to become a great fucking doctor.

Thank you guys for reading and I wish every single one of you all the best. We are all in this together."
Smoked almost everyday since i was 16. Im 24 now. Made it past 30 day marker. Just got back from the gym. 
"ten days sober after thirteen years of almost daily use. it’s not that bad at all. in fact it’s easier than i expected. cheers to my brain 🧠 thanks r/leaves and it’s mods. you guys are life savers 

edit* hit 233 days"
"I hate that people who haven't experienced weed withdrawals don't think it's real Title says all, so many people around me that think i am exaggerating about not being able to eat as much or being drained the entire day. They don't even know the half of it.

After 5 years of daily smoking and no breaks I'm 5 days into the journey to sobriety.


Edit : thanks for all the upvotes guys! This has been one of my first posts on Reddit ever and this community is awesome and so supportive. I'm really glad I made an account thanks to all of you.

Everyone has a different journey and I hope we all make it till the end we just have to power through and remind ourselves why we quit in the first place."
"A month ago I took a break and had never been happier. I went back to daily usage and became apathetic again. We all want to be happy - here's some advice. Turn it around RIGHT NOW. Stop waiting till tomorrow. I've been a Reddit &amp;amp;amp; /Leaves lurker for years, but I felt the need to share.

A month ago I quit for 10 straight days and even within that short span of time I was a much happier person. The only way I got through this break was by constantly distracting myself and by relocating. I left NYC and visited family in D.C.. I am able to work remotely and needed to get away from the concrete jungle.

Before I left for D.C. I planned on getting stoned for the Uber to Penn St., the Amtrak to D.C., and the Uber to the house. I wanted nothing more than to be stoned, while watching something on my laptop or playing some games on my Switch. Unfortunately, I was in an absolute frenzy to get to my train, as I had gotten busy with my remote work, and hadn't finished packing (procrastination). I hurried my ass down to Penn Station, but the entire way there I was fuming that I could not get high for the trip. 

Pathetic.

I purposely didn't bring anything to D.C. - not able to use it around family and not going to sneak around. Withdrawal kicked in quickly. I could not sleep. I was an anxious and restless mess. I was irritable. I was pacing around. I was dealing with both physical symptoms and a psychological war.

**Here was my formula to combat this:** 

* **ACTIVITY:** Working from 8am-4pm. Walks with the dog. Basketball/shooting around. Running. Walking. Movies. TV. Books. Reddit. ANYTHING. Keep yourself busy. If you're bored, think about what you used to enjoy as a child and just run with it. I started drawing with pens &amp;amp;amp; colored pencils again.
* **EXERCISE:** I redirected this energy into exercise. I don't lift weights, but I played basketball by myself for hours in the brutal heat nearly every single day. I love shooting around - it is truly cathartic for me. I also refrained from heavy alcohol usage while I was on this borderline vacation. I also out of nowhere picked-up running, after having gone on some long walks with the dog. Find something to do.
* **POSITIVE SELF-TALK:** I admittedly talk to myself aloud a lot and inner dialogue/thoughts are always running. Instead of being so hard on myself, as I always am, I decided I'd treat myself with respect. Stop calling yourself stupid and stop saying ""I'm such an idiot."" Start talking yourself up. 
* **THINK POSITIVE:** I am an admittedly cynical person and this doesn’t help during a pandemic. However, I needed to keep telling myself that this fight is worth it. I forced myself to smile. I stayed away from social media. I stayed away from the news. I removed myself from my setting/environment whenever the vibes in the room went south. 
* **RELOCATION:** I needed a break from NYC. It has been a dreary and draining experience here, especially living blocks from a hospital. When this all began the sirens did not stop. I needed to escape my smoking den. Relocation has always been key to my breaks. Try to get away, if possible.
* **SOCIALIZATION (with non-smokers):** This is obviously a tricky one at the moment, but social interactions are key to shifting around our moods. Think about a time you were with a negative person. How did you feel afterwards? Now think about a time you were with a charismatic and cheerful person. How did you feel afterwards?

**The results:**

By 10 days the negative effects from withdrawal completely wore off and I found myself to be in a genuinely happy place for the first time since a small getaway to CT. in May. 

I took the subway back up to my apartment and I was the only one on the subway car that was visibly happy. I was bopping to the Hamilton soundtrack, having watched it while on that trip. I was smiling. People were looking at me like I had 10 heads! Why? I understand we are in a crisis and everyone is going through their own shit. Life is tough. But we must remind ourselves that our time is going to come and must focus on the present. This break made me more appreciative of life in general.

**Recent Relapse:**

I smoked that evening when I returned to my tiny apartment and didn't stop.

I recently took a tiny 5 day break without relocating, but caved yesterday evening after an incredibly stressful day of work. I enjoyed myself and am not going to be mad at myself for this slip-up. 

**This Morning:**

This morning I got up at 8:30am and around 9:00am got out of bed and immediately saw a bowl with a tiny hit I'd be able to snag. I told myself last night I would start over in the morning, but as I usually do, I said fuck it, and torched the bowl a few hours ago. 

I am not upset with myself, but a little disappointed.

**TAKEAWAYS:**

This is not easy and is going to take time. But unlike in the past, I have told myself I am going to stop again RIGHT NOW. No more ""I've already smoked today, so what's the difference if I smoke a little more later?"" No more ""Oh, today is the 29th. I'll only smoke a little bit the next few days and start over on the 1st of September."" NOPE, not happening this time. 

I have realized that refraining from usage will make me a happier and more productive person. I hate being an apathetic being on the couch. I may have slipped up a few hours ago, but I also have been successful the past few hours. I only took one hit and didn't repack. I immediately knew I made the wrong decision. But guess what, we live in the present. I smoked in the past. Stop putting it off and just start now. The long-term benefits are undoubtedly better. Let's stop denying this and stop letting our past hurt our present and future.

Have a great day everyone!"
"I quit in 2019 here’s how it went Last year my resolution was to stop smoking pot. I’d been constantly high for nearly 25 years. Wake and bake. Smoke a lunch again mid afternoon then before going home then again after dinner. You get the point. 

It was tough going. The first two or three weeks were the toughest. I had little energy. I was in a shitty mood. I doubt I was fun to live with. I told myself constantly that if I just smoked again I’d be fine. But I realized that voice in my head was wrong. I ignored it and moped through the first three weeks of the year. Then started feeling better. A lot better. 

I felt smarter. I realized I was more present. I forced myself to reconnect with friends and to make new connections with other people in my neighborhood. 

I told myself I was cured then smoked a little in Feb. the plan was moderation but that didn’t happen. I had to go through shorty withdrawal feeling again.  I treated that same cycle again in the summer. 

Then I stopped, like, for real. Now I nearly never crave it. Like where you’re consumed with it can can think of nothing else. However I still think about smoking nearly every day, but it’s like a passing thought. Like, remember how I used to always smoke before X. 

Can’t encourage you all to stay on the path. If you stopped on New Years stick with it. My marriage is better. My life is better. I’m making more money and am generally happier. You can be too. 

And the real kicker? I used to say “I need to smoke to calm down”. Eventually I realized that I’m more calm now that I don’t smoke and a lot of the stuff I was coping with was DUE TO weed, not solved by it. 

Hope you find out the same thing. Shout out to everyone on this sub. Huge help."
"So fucking scared to do this. Literally tears of terror are in my eyes as I type right now.  I need to stop smoking to get my life together. I'm 31 now and had my first toke at 14. The next day I became a daily user who was proud to only have missed about 3 weeks of smoking over the past 17 years. I grew up with weed, i grew up high all the time. Getting high at my private, unisex high school during lunch and again otw home. Wake n bake in the car otw there the next morning. Point is I made it all through high school high, graduated with a 3.6 gpa (high af), played varsity sports ( a little high) and started taking my  talents for granted. Meanwhile I am teaching myself to play music. Formin a rock band from my peers, we smoked out every practice. In fact i remember the bass player leaving bc we were getting high instead of practicing. 

Weed became part of the very fabric that held my life together. There were no emotions in high school after weed. I convinced myself I made better music when high. And if you study high and take the test high you get high grades, like the drunken call back in beerfest the movie.

Then Hurricane Katrina hits my city in my Senior year. Mass devestation, lose every possession except for 2 guitars and a bag of hand me down trinkets my Great Grandfather had given me. Evacuate to a smallish town. ""Great, wheres the weed guy here?"" - I quickly found the source in my new town. So, I make it to a party. Find the pot heads, blow down. Rinse and repeat until graduation. (Also started using ecstasy pretty heavily until graduation)

Summer before college, come back to hometown, rebuild with my parents. Well partially until i realized i couldnt get high in the fema trailers with everyone else around, so i left and went to stay with a friend and his parents. WTF! WHO FUCKING DOES THAT? 18 y/o and like nah mom and dad, ""i cant live i  such cramped quarters"". I was a little ungrateful bitch. That didnt have the tools to deal with emotion. Most of high school is a fuzzy blur. I remember faces and some names but again, its all very unclear.

At this point you are probably thinking I am a total burnout, but the truth is I am still functional. Or at least I was until college started.

Get to university for orientation. Find pot heads, get high, miss all entrance exams. Have to take remedial classes which ultimately caused me to take summer classes later to graduate on time. More on that later.
The rest of college is filled with memories of bright lights, drunk nights and heartbreak.

 Year 1 of University, I meet my first really serious girlfriend. We smoked, took some molly, woke up naked alongside each other. Couldnt remember her name or where we were. But holy shit there was a naked chick in my bed and that hadn't happened before, I love college! We start dating, she takes xanax like its prescribed. Went through 5 years of what i now call pain management. We were toxic for each other. Couldnt have a good time unless we were both high. Her family loved me so that counted for a whole lot. Especially bc i kind of black sheep'd myself in my family. So i was seeking validation from her parental units and not even conversating with my own. Especially her dad. He was a cool S.O.B. Worked as a top dog for a barge company on the river $$$. But it wasnt because he was cool, I have come to realize I wanted his support more than the rest of the family because my Bio- dad left before I was born. 

So I have been trying to fill this hole in my soul/heart whatever using everyone and everything but myself to overcome it. Her and I break up. It was a critical point in my life, the first time I though weed might be the prlblem and not the cure.... nah fuck that toke it up, fuck that bitch, amirite?

I cant remember shit anymore. We are now in post graduate working life. I take the first job offer that doesnt test for pot, youre looking at the newest most promising salesman to step foot into a ... Guitar Center. ???? Really? 4 years of music education and you go into retail sales? Not what I expected to do. But lets be real. I never had ambition or goals at the time because i had been high for the better half of a decade. So i work there for 5 years, start looking how to get out.

Meet an old friend at GC who tells me his job is hiring. 80 bucks and a fake urine sample later, I employed at a warehouse counting boxes all day! Guess what makes that more fun? You got it. Weeed! Until you drop all the ketchup from the top shelf because you hit the gas and not the break on the forklift. So I started slowing down smoking. 1 time a day. That lasted about 2 years before I  left and started a new job. I moved on to work as a service writer in a body shop. Chasing a bigger check. Bc at this point I realized I am too far removed from university to go back for something else ( boy was I wrong) so lets move forward with people who will train me

Today I am a car salesman, i went from having all the potential in the world to car sales and most of how I got here is a blur. I dont work out anymore bc i am at work between 10 and 11 hours a day now and not really making money. I cant take any well paying technical jobs bc I have a music degree and still piss dirty. And on top of all that, my 2nd serious relationship in life ended 3 days ago. I am in therapy once a week now and i can see how it will benefit me in the long run. But I cant help but feeling like weed is a major roadblock in my life.

Since her and I broke up, I have only been able to eat and sleep with the aid of weed. But i can't think. So i sober up a little to make it through the day and then the emotions crush me. Literally leave the office to go bawl my eyes out in the car. She says that its not about weed or anything related to it since she smokes too, but I can definitely see how it caused issues in the relationship. By the time Lunch comes around Im looking for my oil pen every god damn day. I just want to be able to be sober and make real connections with people again. Think through a problem and have it solved. Ive spent half of my life in a fucking fog. No wonder why nothing seems beautiful anymore and why I long for the feeling we get as kids when you see something dreamy and it gives you hope that your life could be that beautiful. My life has had its own beauty, but it also hasnt really been my life. That wasnt me making decisions I was hiding behind the shell of a 20 something year old.

Todays the day fam. Today is day 1. Ive got the chills just typing that out. Fuck theres power in admission. Here's to a better future. And if I can do this. You can do this.


EDIT: to the kind soul who thought my words hold a monetary value. I cant tell you how much i appreciate the Gold and the comforting words waiting on the other side. 2nd best decision I have made all year was to open up to a bunch of strangers on Reddit. Best decision was to get clean and deal with my emotional stresses. Thank you all. I am here for you too. Dm if you want to talk.

2nd edit: Platinum... ya'll are too much. Just read it. Let it resonate. Know you're not alone. And most of all we have to remember we are bettering ourselves. And thats the reason to quit!"
"Shoot, I missed it! Clean for a year... And a day! I was adamantly waiting for the 26th to post my one year blurb. Just checked my app and heh, it was actually yesterday! So although a bit late, here's my one year post on what it's been like.

People seem to think life will be so much better if we just get clean. To that I promise you, it absolutely is! Now life isn't all sunshine and roses, I still have some bad days, but it's amazing how much better things are overall. My bad days are better, and my good days are... gooder.

The money, ohh the money! I have a savings account now! I'm no longer in overdraft or taking payday loans! I'm starting to save for retirement! According to my app I've saved at least $2000, and that's the bare minimum. That's for a less than average day of using, not including splurging on something extra. That's just on maryjane, not including the lifestyle of takeout food and needless taxis. That's not including the extra shifts I've picked up from work, and not calling in because I'm ""just not feeling it"" or I accidentally got too high before work. Money can be a powerful motivator, and I promise you more will come your way if you stay clean.

I still have problems. I'm still socially anxious. I get a hit of FOMO when people go to spark up. I get the occasional craving, either walking by the dispensary or just feeling a little off, like a toke would help with that. But after years of trying to get clean I've finally realized a toke will not improve anything. I'll get a head rush, a quick hit of dopamine, then sabotage myself for the remainder of the day. Not to mention reigniting that craving cycle all over again. It's just not worth it. No matter what I choose to stay clean.

For those still in the thick of things, going through the severely misunderstood issues of marijuana withdrawal, stick with it! No matter what you're going through a toke will not help, at least not in the long run. Melatonin and meditation for sleep, fruits and smoothies for something to eat, and I hear working out helps substantially. Don't be afraid to reach out to us here, we've all got your back in this ongoing battle. 

Together we can do what we can't do alone. 

TL;DR: Officially over a year clean, life's gotten much better, it will for you too.

Edit: Thank you for the kind comments and awards, it's really appreciated!"
"Major props to all of you who have gone 12 hours free... 24hrs,48hrs, weeks, months, years! I've been a user of cannabis for 24 years with a couple of breaks.. longest one being 9 months.
I felt that was some of the happiest times of my life! I was for once, confident, and just walked with my head high. One day while being sober I lied to myself and said I can smoke a couple hits and that will be it. Well I tried, and it came back full force! Now I've been trying to quit for the last couple years and every time it's one more sack, one more hit, this will be the last one I swear. I can only go a few hours without taking a rip...
I feel sad and pathetic that I can't give it up, even knowing that one time being sober was the best feeling. I want that back but it's just hard.... I read your stories and it gives me hope that one day I could be free again.
Positive vibes, take care, peace"
"If you haven’t Relapsed today, you are a strong person. If you stay strong for another day, you will be stronger than yesterday.

And for those who relapsed, you will be stronger the next day IF you take something away from this relapse.

Have an excellent 4th and good luck."
"Clean and sober. I'd like to share my story. I am a Dutch woman of 65. I started smoking hashies when I was 14 and did so for 44 years. I would always say I was not addicted because I didn't smoke when I was on holiday. Needless to say I always found people to smoke with. But the last years of my life long habit I was very bored with it. I smoked all day and was bored. Finally I found the opportunity to go into rehab and I did and after the first three weeks in which you are supposed to stop, I stopped. It was very very hard. I could not sleep, my mind was running but everyone assured me it would get better. And also the times I wanted to smoke would pass. I believed them. They were right. I was so afraid to stop but there was nothing to be afraid of. I love to have a clear head. I am so happy I stopped. It has been 8 years now. I have never longed for a smoke. Never want that feeling of being stoned again. Thanks for reading."
"365 days free from weed I made it to the one year mark today. Before quitting I never thought I'd be able to live without weed but here I am. It has definetly gotten much easier over time tho I still get the occasional craving.
I'd just like to thank you guys for being a source of inspiration.

That's all."
"I'm ending my abusive relationship with Mary Jane. At first she was a really good friend. She made me happy, made me laugh and smile, told me I was the best guy in the world. 

Years later her whole attitude changed. She tells me I'm a piece a shit, I'm worthless, she makes me lethargic and depressed, she takes all of my money and took all of my friends away from me. She gets me upset sometimes and since I'm too much of a pussy to take it out on her i take it out on the people closest to me. 

No more I say! Marijuana you broke my heart you bitch so im breaking up with you and I'm dating your cousin"
"35yo, smoked nearly daily since I was 18. Today is my first serious Day One without, finding this sub is what inspired me. Thanks! "
"GOT IN! I can't believe this, I've gotten into acting school with a scholarship! They said that my audition was one of the best they've seen and I'm meeting with deen next week! I never ever would have applied in the first place if I was still smoking, I really lost sight of my dreams when I started and now I can see them slowly coming back into view. If you want it you can do it! I wouldn't have been able to do any of this if it wasn't for this group and I'm just so thankful for everything. Don't give up and if you want to start do it, I promise you will not regret it.

Edit: oh my gosh thank you so much everyone for the kind words! I don't have any friends so this really means a lot, I feel so much love ♡♡♡"
"To All Leavers There are so many terrific people here who keep the forum up and running, you all deserve some thanks from another group.

This is a group to which I belong: the sleepers/creepers. 
We're here, intermittently throwing an upvote someone's way, but more often than not we just read what everyone else is saying (if it's been a tough week, we might be pushed into posting something).

We're not generally the people who help and give advice in these posts. Personally, I can never find the right words. My thoughts always seem too personal to help anyone else out.

Thankfully, there are others out there. Those of you who are able to turn your experiences into reports which can help other people through difficult times. 

Thank you for doing this. It's such a relief to have a community to return to. To think about cannabis a couple of times in a day, go onto Reddit and see that I'm not alone - that none of us are.

Without all your constant work this place wouldn't exist, so on behalf of the people who can't bring themselves to do it, but find solace in the company of others, thank you in all sincerity."
"Quitting smoke...because I'm going to be a DAD!! In one of the most unexpected but humbling twists of the M. Night Shamalamadingdong movie that is my life, we found out we were expecting 4 days after we got married. Total accident. It has been tough, we just moved cross country for a new job that didn't turn out to be all it was hyped up to be, but we've been there for each other all the way. 

I used MJ just about every night after work to either relieve stress/tension/anxiety or just for fun, but it's time to clean the pieces and put them away. I've got a new set of responsibilities now. And I can't fuck this one up boys, it's not the same as remembering the joint pass rotation order!

Wish me luck. I'll smoke again when/if my kid finds out about it and is old enough. I smoked with my dad a couple times, it's not weird as long as everybody is an adult about it. And we live in a recreational state so the culture will be around...

It's a girl! Our first."
"With Weed you get stuck doing the same things for years. Back to Day 1 again. Need this post for myself when I am feeling weak. 

I realized last night I’ve been doing the same shit (get home, smoke, watch a movie, play video games repeat) for 3 years. I’ve managed to secure a good job in my field and lead a successful life but dam. Outside of work everything has stood still for 3 years. I haven’t gotten better at anything not work related and it depresses me. I don’t pick up my guitar, I don’t explore the neighborhood, I haven’t picked up any new skill, nothing. So please don’t let this happen to you! Rage hard against doing the same thing for years and letting your life just stand still and GROW!  

Best of luck to you all. Never forget addiction is real. Love and hugs to all of you!"
"DAY 199....... it’s as if I’ve found the real me again, the one that was born without THC flowing through my body. I will admit after 21 years of heavy use I had truly lost myself in the mind and body. Feels good, feels real, feels like freedom!!! YOU TOO HAVE THE CHOICE ! "
"I thought I had damaged my brain!! Long time lurker, first time poster here,

After smoking daily for 27 years I decided to give up last August and here I am 195 days since my last joint. However I'm not here on a victory lap to bask in my wonderful achievement (though I am proud of myself I must say). It's more to offer reassurance to those who feel they may have caused irreparable damage to their brain and their capacity to learn new things. This was a real concern to me prior to quitting; my short term memory was fucked and my capacity to retain new information was seemingly non existent. I knew however that if I was to successfully quit for good  I would need to replace my one and only hobby (getting stoned, sad but true!) with something else, so I decided that I would study Spanish 28 years since I studied it in school. 

Fast forward through the nightmare of the initial few  weeks of withdrawal symptoms (mainly horrendous insomnia coupled with crushing anxiety). I finally sat down to study Spanish; having previously been able to speak to a fairly decent level (B2) I was shocked at just how much I had forgotten. To the extent that I had to relearn using Duolingo. However within a few weeks of studying and further sobriety it all came flooding back but I guess it stands to reason that I hadn't forgotten, it was just laying dormant. What has really surprised me though has been my capacity to learn new vocabulary and new grammar. I estimate that I have learnt in the region of 500 words in the last 6 months in additional to learning more advanced grammar. I am now able to watch and follow Spanish TV every evening. Something  a year ago I would have thought impossible. 

My brain wasn't damaged, isn't damaged, it was just being held hostage for 27 years!

So my message to those of you who feel you have lost the capacity to learn, to advance yourself and to reinvent yourself, you really haven't! Trust me your brain is absolutely fine, it's ready and waiting for your motivation to come along and wake it up and achieve whatever you want to achieve!

Break that Stockholm syndrome. 

Good luck!"
"This may be an unpopular opinion but... ...the easiest part about quitting weed is abstaining from smoking. Said to me from my substance abuse counselor who’s been practicing for 40 years. After thinking about it some I tend to agree with her. Aside from the physical withdrawal, the hardest part is finding a new way to live, changing habits, discovering new ways to spend time and energy, developing new interests, and tackling underlying mental health issues. It’s been just over 5 months for me, and I can see how I’ve failed to call it quits in the past. I never put any effort into changing my life beyond just not smoking. So this is a reminder to pay attention and nurture all different aspects of yourself. Deal with ghosts from the past. Fill your new free time with positive things. It’s a hard journey, but it’s worth it!"
"When you're quitting, sometimes it's easy to feel like you're the only person in the world going through it. When those moments come, think about this: /r/leaves had 75,895 unique visitors last month. Look at this picture -- that's how many people are walking with you right now... "
"Smoking because you’re lonely, being lonely because you smoke. Does anyone else ever fall into this toxic cycle? I find that if I am regularly smoking, I don’t put in any effort into socializing and spend my free time being high instead. As a result I lose touch with people and have no one to talk to or spend time with, so I smoke to feel better and have something to do. 

The worst is when you finally stop smoking and are left with the consequences but have no cushy vape pen to make it feel better. 

Thankfully I only smoked for a couple months this time, I had made it like 10 months before I started up again. This should be much easier than when I stopped after smoking for years. This is the first time I’ve decided to stop smoking *before* anything bad happened, usually I don’t stop until something bad happens but my grades are still really good and my new job is still going well. I’m stopping to keep it that way and to work on other areas of my life."
"4 months today and no one to tell It's been 4 months since my last puff. The only person who knew about my addiction was my wife, so she's also the only one who knows about my success in regards to quitting. Feels good!

Edit: thank you so much for all of the support!!

Edit #2: I'm a female and I feel that there are less females who are addicted to pot, so the judgments are even harsher. That's another reason that I never really told people about my addiction."
"What moment made you realize you needed to stop smoking pot? For me it was when I took my boyfriend to visit my hometown for the very first time. 

""Show me all the places you hung out,"" he said.

Well I could show him a park...where I smoked a lot. Or another park...where I smoked a lot. Or the parking lot where I ate McDonald's by myself...after I got stoned. Or the apartment where I hung out with a older drug dealer all day to smoke for free (even though I was sexually harassed by his friends constantly).

Looking back, my life completely vanished once I turned 16. Everything and anything involved smoking weed, getting weed, and dealing with the high.

Before then, I was a starting varsity lacrosse player, with good grades and genuine friendships. That all vanished once I started smoking. Now I'm 24, the same stoner as before, with nothing interesting to share. Weed makes you boring and dull.

Today I threw away all my pieces. 7 days clean. 

What moment made you realize you had to stop?"
"Ask yourself — Why do I feel the need to continually alter my reality with weed? What is it about my reality that I’m trying to escape? Then set about putting in the hard work creating for yourself a reality which needs no chemical alteration. For me this has been focusing on my overall health and wellness . . . physical, mental, spiritual. It’s important to recognize the connection between these three. They, like the three legs of a stool, depend upon each other for overall stability. Healthy eating, exercise, meditation/yoga . . . these are the three legs of my stool. 

Speaking of, it’s 4:30 am, time to sit in quiet meditation, then do a little yoga, then go for a run, then eat a healthy breakfast. Then go to work feeling energized and rejuvenated.

I’m a 41 year old male and I smoked for 26 years. I quit drinking 11 years ago as I also had an alcohol addiction. I thought for a very long time that I needed marijuana to cope with my anxiety and depression, though I finally realized that it was ultimately making these conditions worse. I’m currently 7 months weed free. Do I still miss smoking? Yes, sometimes. But the cravings are getting fewer and further between. It’s amazing how much clearer my mind is. I didn’t even realize the fog I’d been living in. I don’t want to go back. My kids have a completely sober and present dad now, something I didn’t have as a kid. My wife has a completely sober and present husband. She’s proud of me. I’m proud of myself for the first time in a very long time. I feel light and free and genuinely happy and content for once. Sobriety is feeling pretty darn good. 

You can do it too if you really want to... :)"
"Has anyone else found that they're better at eye contact when they're sober? It's a small thing but I've realised that I'm much better at it. When I would answer the door to delivery drivers or go to the shop or something whilst high, I'd always overthink about how much I'm looking at the person, or just straight up avoid it.   
There'd be times when I'd leave and realise that I had no idea what the person I just interacted with looked like, because I completely avoided looking at them.  


Now I can look them straight in the eyes without anxiety, smile and tell them to have a nice day without overthinking or panicking about it.  


I didn't know how much weed changed me until I stopped smoking."
wrote this on my hand to fight the cravings and depression 
"Its not about quitting Its about adopting a new life style. If you focus on not doing weed but you really still want to then you are still focused on weed and it'll be difficult to sustain. Instead seek out a new life, a new lifestyle. Most people do not smoke weed. We don't need it, we've just convinced ourselves that we do. Our brains and its thoughts are powerful and have the ability to keep us hooked or free us. We just need to figure out how to tap into that. It's a simple concept and one that is not easy to implement. We're all born with all the tools we need to cope. They get rusty over time while we're using weed and not using them. Once we stop, with intent to do better they start to function again. We also develop new tools along the way. Relapsing is not a joke or something to be experimented with. If you had been addicted a relapse is playing with fire and once that boundary is broken down its real easy to fall back into your old patterns."
"Today is my one-year anniversary of quitting smoking weed! Dear adorable, striving, hopeful, desperate, lucky Leavers:

If I could do it, so can you! I smoked regularly for 5+ years, grew a huge crop in my backyard, sold weed, and had over a pound of bud in the house when I decided NO MORE. 

I was so miserable and depressed the year before I quit.  I finally quit on Feb. 11, 2019. 

It wasn't easy. I had a few relapses on edibles during the past year but each time I realized how sucky weed is for me. I am SO SO GLAD that I quit! 

I am no longer as depressed, anxious, hopeless and stuck. I am exercising more, I'm stronger physically and mentally, I'm present, optimistic and hopeful.  

I'm so grateful for the support I received along the way. 

If you have any doubts that your weed use is holding you back, I urge you to take the journey I did, and quit. Quit today. Cold turkey. Throw it all away. 

YOU ARE NOT A STONER! YOU ARE A LEAVER! 

Love to all.

Julie S., Oakland California"
"The Boredom I smoked weed full time for 6 years. After finally gettin clean at the end of last year i stupidly fell back into the routine during lockdown here in Ireland.

Thankfully Im clean again about 3 weeks now. 

The hardest part for me was/is dealing with the boredom, a feeling i hadnt felt for 6 years.

I think Randy Marsh said it best: 

'The truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but… well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.'

Anyone else relate?

EDIT:

This blew up more than i expected.

To anyone else reading this I'll offer you some advice i already put in one of the comments below that served me well.

-

If you want to outwit the devil, it is extremely important that you don't give him advanced notice.
Even if you only announce to yourself your intentions, the devil will know, because who do you think the devil is?

Meaning - try not to focus on giving up the smoke but rather on your actions in the present moment. If you tell yourself you're not smoking again for a year then your mind will present you with the idea of 365 excruciating days without smoke. 

Get through today first, it will get easier day by day."
"Smoking every night, to smoking every weekend for a month, to realising 'nope, don't want this in my life anymore' Benefits I have noticed thus far:

- coffee is now rocket-fuel and I'm down from 6-8 cups daily to about 3

- night is now when I have the most adventures, up mountains and in castles and beneath lakes and with the most weird of characters

- my erections are quicker and firmer but I no longer feel the need to appease the fella

- sudden surplus of cash, essentially a 3k pay-rise

- renewed confidence in myself and less social anxiety, now that I don't have the secret shame of addiction

- actually able to remember shit from the films and documentaries I enjoy

- no longer wasting my evenings, aching for bedtime to arrive to smoke my one-a-day

- my desire to interact with others feels at a normal level rather than overwhelming reluctance

- my sentences are more coherent, and mental arithmetic is once again a pleasurable breeze"
2.5 years sober and it's still hard to resist invites like this :( Damn :(( 
"Can't f****** do it, seriously want to blow my f****** head off. Quitting due to being drug tested in a CPS case. I've been slacking the past week or two and decided 2 days ago, fuck this. This isn't worth it. I'd rather have my child and be a productive father than sit around with a foggy head all day.

It's day 2 and I can't even function properly. I'm constantly screaming, absolutely fucking enraged at the wind blowing the wrong way, I can't play video games with my friends which is literally one of the only things I genuinely enjoyed. 

I'm not relapsing or planning on smoking, but holy shit. How long is this going to last??? I thought about slitting my wrists open and I actually felt sharp pains in my arm for an hour after thinking about it for .5 seconds. 

I know it gets better, but fuck. Right now I just want to curl up with a 12 gauge and not wake up tomorrow. I hate my fucking job, I can't see my fucking kid, my life is in fucking shambles and the one escape I had from this shit, is gone for good. The world being in the state it's in right now doesn't help either. I can't go five fucking feet without absolutely snapping at something so small it doesn't even matter. 

Not seeking advice, judgement or anything along those lines. I'm just irritated as FUCK and need to vent. Thank you to anyone who reads, hopefully the post doesn't get removed as somehow all of my posts on this SubReddit do."
I made it No weed since 1st of January. Im so happy and proud of my self. Was really addicted for more than 5 years. You all can do it!!
"""Boredom"" list & life goals to prevent relapse "
"My SECRET 🔑 to finally just STOP the cycle of self imposing slavery to the WEED trap. 27 years smoking flew by. Now I’m free and not falling back in! Hi everyone, So 27 years living in a weed trap and could not figure away out of it. Living the same loop knowing this problem with MJ is a chain for life and the only way is to break a link.

We all know we have to change our mindset to make a solid change. The mind is a deep mysterious place and we can truly change it if we want to & know how. So, when we just keep toking and don’t actually stop, even though we say or plan to soooooo many times. This is the conscious mind at work. 

So here’s the 🔑... CBT -Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. And I don’t mean going to therapy. I am speaking of a specific type of CBT. VISUALIZATION- I will break it down a bit. It takes very little time to do and is one of the most powerful CBT techniques there is. So what I did and it made a core change within me. **Here is what to do: makes some notes on exactly the person you want to become, how you will look, feel, be, do, etc. Create the image of the best version of yourself that you want to become. Then everyday as often as you would like. Get in a quite place alone so you can focus. And literally think, see, feel and be in that person you created in your mind using all of your senses and emotions. Do this process multiple times a day for 5-15 minute intervals. Stay consistent. You will be 🤯. What should happen is in roughly 3 weeks, give or take, pending your consistency, you will just wake up one day and have this urgency to be in that person you’ve been visualizing. Neurologically what’s happening is your going into the back door of your subconscious/non conscious mind and rewriting your self image, so to speak. It for me was like magic. I started this process about a month ago, and no kidding around, it just hit me in a way that the conscious mind can hardly believe. It flipped the switch, I could not seem to do for myself consciously. Today makes 2 days sober. keep in mind other factors can keep this from working.. like lack of belief it works, not being consistent, distractions while visualizing by others or you straying off of conscious thought. No promises it will work, but it had a miraculous affect for me.

Your self image is the foundation for a solid person. Eliminate all excessive intrusive intrinsic thoughts, that are negative and keeping you thinking you are crap. They only reinforce disempowering thinking and keep you stuck in the old you. I hope this serves someone, somewhere. It is the key for the trap door. But you will need to grow and or do more to keep from falling back in. Believe in yourself and you can do anything you put your mind to. 
Much love to all of you struggling to find your true self!  JB"
"Weed became the source of my unhappiness, and at the same time it became the only thing to give me relief from the very unhappiness it was causing. I’ve had enough of this cycle. I’ve smoked fairly heavily for 17 years. When I first got to College, I was a completely different person. I was full of life, I had a personality, I could make people laugh, I had wit and it was easy. I had friends, women were romantically interested in me, I was...well, normal. I always struggled a bit with social anxiety, but when I wasn’t abusing weed, I could swallow those feelings and put on my extrovert mask and go to parties and still enjoy myself in social settings. I started smoking in high school, but I only really reached abuse-levels in college.

It was all downhill from there. I nearly failed out of college, and became gradually more withdrawn as my abusive habit grew. This led to my social anxiety inevitably taking a stronger hold over me. Weed only exacerbated that issue. I’ve been lonely for a long time. I had a friend here and there, but mostly I have just felt empty and lonely. I gained weight, stopped exercising and taking care of myself, and this affected my confidence which only made the social anxiety worse. By the end of college, I barely could recognize myself when I looked in the mirror.

When I wasn’t high, I hated myself. I hated the person I let myself become. And I could never find any other form of relief for this pain, the pain of self-hatred. The only relief was weed, which of course was the cause of all my issues. Even though I have smoked for 17 years, I’ve always been aware deep down of that fact, and how dangerous it was. Weed helped me forget the reality of all the career opportunities I’d lost, of how uncomfortable I felt in my own skin, of how alien I felt in social situations, of the damage I’d done to my mental and physical health.

Enough is enough. I will try to face my self-hatred and change whatever I have to change for these feelings to stop. I want a social life again. I want to be physically fit again. I want my personality back. Hey Mary Jane, seriously fuck you, you were an abusive lover to me in every possible sense. And I am leaving you. This is day 4 sober. I’m never going back to you. NEVER."
"Went on a surf trip with strangers. Lots of weed going on. I felt no urge whatsoever. I found that I love to be sober, no social awkwardness and paranoia, feels good. I'm sober for 21 months.

Recently I went on a one-day surf trip with strangers, something new and challenging for me (I used to have social difficulties).

While on the road, people lit one joint inside the van, I said no thanks. At the beach, lots of joints here and there. On the way back, more weed. It made me remember that I was just like that, having to smoke all the time. 

I felt good and free to be able to be just normal, talk to people, or just be quiet with no disconfort or awkwardness, just chill. I honestly felt no urge to smoke, or any frustration whatsoever. People were kind of friendly and did not care about me smoking or not, and I did not care about them smoking too. I enjoyed the trip vey much, had a great day, talked to people, got some pretty nice waves, and went back home tired and happy, it felt just great. 

I honestly love to be sober and free, I hope you find that joy in sobriety too."
"Sober me wants to get high. High me wants to be sober. I have been stuck in this loop for the past few years. I hate the dirty paranoid feeling and anxiety that I get after the first few puffs, however I can't seem to stop. I am a lot less depressed and anxious when sober. It's logical to quit. Why do I keep getting high? It's not doing me any favors. It's rarely fun anymore.

The only thing I miss when sober is the anticipation of rolling a blunt and the experience of passing it around, the rush of buying and the first inhalation. Everything after is misery.

I don't know what to do. "
420! Not blazing it! Day 496 
"Being stuck in a cycle of smoking weed is like being stuck in a hole; It seems very hard to climb out, but once you do you realise the hole wasn't actually that deep. That's how I feel every time I gear up to quit anyway. I have severe anxiety/fear leading up to my ""last smoke"", but once I get the first day under belt, it's like, ""okay, it's not \*that\* bad""."
Today marks 45 days without cigs and 35 days without weed. I finally stuck to it. 
"I’d rather be sober and depressed than stoned and numb Really tempted to relapse right now and this is what I’m trying to tell myself. I’m really tired because quitting makes it hard to sleep, and it makes it hard to eat enough which doesn’t help my energy levels either. I know if I relapse I’ll just have to go through the withdrawals all over again so I’m trying to tough it out. Anyone else feeling this right now?"
Made it to 100! 
"Weed is so dangerous because you stop realising what it's doing to you... ...while you don't even know why you smoke in the first place. 

While on weed, I will never:

- be confident, not only around stoner friends

- work where I want

And, most importantly:

- meet the woman of my dreams.

Ask yourself if you really want to live your next 5 years like your last 5. Or if you wanna look back and be able to say: ""yea, what I've done the last years actually wasn't a complete mess like before""

All of us needs to accept one thing:
There is a little guy living in all of us, who just wants to chill in bed, smoke and do nothing. The purpose of our life is to fight this guy, no matter what. He is not in charge, you are. And if you're not, show this little fucker how you're going to take back control over your life."
"I really miss being witty Back in the day I could respond to somebody with a sharp, witty comeback or statement when the opportunity presented itself.

Nowadays it takes longer for words to even register in my mind, and my mind often draws a blank when attempting to conjure up a response. I miss having that quick thinking, man. i need it back!"
"A Suggestion From My Therapist For me, the hardest part of quitting was just knowing that I couldn't smoke. When I told my therapist that, she told me something that really changed my perspective on quitting. Technically speaking, I COULD smoke if I wanted to, I'm just choosing not to. Now when I start to crave it, I tell myself that I could smoke, but I am not going to. It's a really simple change of mindset that is super empowering. Rather than feeling horrible about not being able to get high, I feel proud of myself for choosing not to even when things get tough. I hope this can help some of you on here! I'm so proud of wherever you are on your quitting journey and you should be proud of yourself too :)"
"I did one of my favorite hobbies yesterday without weed. I love kayak fishing the saltwater flats. Watching the sun come up, feeling the salt air, looking for fish. I used to enjoy this every time for 12 years while high. It’s a massive trigger for me to go fishing and not smoke. I quit once for 45 days and didn’t go fishing during that time. 

I’m on day 5 again and the weather was perfect. I started thinking about fishing and of-course the triggers came. I said to myself, “weed, you will not hold me back from something I love.” I have been fishing since I can remember, why should this hold me back? Well I went yesterday and had a blast. It kinda sucked on the drive there, but as soon as I started paddling, I totally forgot about wanting to get high. I was actually much more aware of what was going on, more energy, and no stopping for munchies. It was great. Triggers are hard to get over, but if you can, go do what you want and make new memories. Memories that you will actually remember!"
Words between a friend and me :)

Thank you all for constantly sharing your stories in here, it definitely helps a ton going through this. 

Im really proud of myself for this achievement."
"Feels good! Anyone can do it, I'm here if you need "
"Getting off weed feels like getting my brain back As a business person, the feeling of getting full functionality of your brain back is incredible. Numbers process faster, solutions come to me quicker, everything feels great. 

Being incredibly productive during the day helps me with my nighttime cravings tremendously."
"working on day 45, was glad not to be high when a neighbor needed a ride to the ER I got a frantic call from a neighbor just before noon.  She fell on the sidewalk and had hurt her face and arm.  She has a manual transmission and needed a ride to the hospital.  

It was great to be in a sober position to get her to the ER and wait around while she was admitted.

Positive momentum leaves!"
Hey guys so I'm in detox for pot. Some might find it extreme but I needed the extra support. For those that smoked due to mental illness I hope this crappy drawing I did brings support to someone out there. 9 days clean and finally feeling my old self. 
I'm tired of being so predictable. Girlfriend had a talk with me last night about self-control and improvement. 
"For those of you who can’t imagine not smoking... I get it. I was a MAJOR stoner. I smoked all day, everyday. Like an eighth a day. If I had weed, it was being smoked. Before work, during work, after work. I didn’t do anything if I couldn’t smoke too. I spent 10 years like that. I tried countless times to quit. I would be able to stop for maybe a week (but drinking everyday) but then I’d return to it and I’d be back to where I started. 

And then one day I was just too sick and tired of being sick and tired. I couldn’t handle it anymore. So I got help. I knew I couldn’t do it alone so I entered outpatient treatment. I’ve now been sober from weed and alcohol for 59 days! Trust me when I say that if I can do it, you can do it. You may need help and that’s totally ok. But life on the other side is sooo worth it. If anyone needs anyone to talk to, feel free to message me :)"
"You’re not an idiot, you’re just high all the time. This is my first post and hopefully a wake up call to myself that this lifestyle is starting to ware on me and it’s showing. 

My biggest fear in life is that I wont be competent enough to preform my responsibilities in life. The idea that you can do everything you can do sober just as well high is a lie. It’s been degrading my work for too long and it’s time to stop. 

When you’re high or have recently been high, your ability to search for answers and make decisions is fucked. You will not give a clear of an answer to a question. You will not make as good of a decision as if you were sober.  You make life decisions and investments that are clouded every time you act under intoxication instead of clarity. 

If you weren’t high, you’d think clearer, make more rational decisions, speak clearer to people so that they would know how intelligent you actually are. Instead you’ve decided that intelligence is inherent and doesn’t need to be nurtured. Rather than building upon ideas by reading relevant literature, building relationships with people of similar interests or exploring your amazing personality. You instead hide yourself in an emotionless state spending your time, energy and motivation to avoid the emotional roller coaster that is sobriety. 

Show people that there is more too you than a silent figure who passes in and out of interactions. Stop being excited to go home to a bag of funk. Stop running away from being in a state of mind that people will learn to love you for. 

There is no originality in smoking cannabis, only repetition. Don’t be the same thing you were yesterday, its getting boring. "
"Hey newbies, this is very doable. I smoked 43 years I started gummies 6-7 months before I quit and they were WAY more addictive than pot.  It was hard like it was never hard before to stop.  So it took a lot of energy to stop.  Many false starts.  Tossed a lot of pot, paraphernalia, and gummies.  Sometimes buy and trash twice a day.  In the end writing all my feelings before, during, and after smoking  or eating a gummy was the ticket.  The details.  When I read it back it is just pitiful being controlled by an expensive plant.  I  want you to know I only had cravings for 2 days and zero physical withdrawal.  No problems sleeping.  The first two nights I was up a little later than usual but no biggie.  There are so many horror stories here from the  long term use of CARTS, Gummies and whatever else that is super strong and not just your basic high THC pot.  So today is day 20 and I am feeling fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  You can do it too.

Edit:  Wow, this resonated with people.  Glad to help.  Today makes 3 weeks and that is how much time it takes to break a bad habit.  Never give up!  It's worth it. "
"Today I learned that it’s okay to crave weed I used to be high everyday all day, for almost a year now. Right now I’m on day 10. 

I’ve realised I have a lot of guilt when it comes to smoking weed. I thought that quitting should mean that I won’t ever smoke again, and I won’t even want to. I have felt so guilty the last few days every time I wanted a joint in my hand. 

Today I’ve realised it’s okay to want to smoke. It’s okay to crave something you’ve become so used to having and then suddenly disappears from your life. That’s normal. People crave or miss weed, drugs, coffee, junk food, parties, a holiday, a special someone, a pet... Anything. Just because you want it doesn’t mean that’s wrong, or that it is still controlling you. 

Cravings are okay to have. There is no reason to feel guilty. It’s how you act in response to them that matters.

EDIT: Thanks for all the lovely comments guys, I wasn’t expecting this to resonate with so many people! Stay safe and stay strong!"
"Does anyone else only feel motivated to stop smoking weed when they're high? Usually the first thing I feel when I take a toke is guilt. Guilt for having given in to the temptations of her sweet aroma. Guilty for not being able to resist smoking, even for a day. I don't smoke much per day, usually 2-4 tokes, but it's still enough that I feel like I shouldn't be smoking every day. I've been smoking weed daily for almost a year now, ever since my girlfriend and I got an apartment together. I don't know how to stop, or even if I truly want to. I do know however that if my girlfriend ever becomes pregnant, I am taking all of our weed stuff and either giving it away or throwing it away. I just hope that when that time comes I will have the willpower to follow through with it."
"The smokers dilemma when getting sober: Sober me wants to get high. High me wants to be sober. It makes me feel like a yo-yo.

When I am sober I justify why smoking weed is okay.

When I am high, I make all my plans on how I am quitting weed. 

It goes on like this for sometimes months. 

It makes me insane.

I want off this crazy train.

"It's been over a year and I can study for hours. For the longest time I thought I was just stupid and I had a short attention span. 
...well I was. But less so now!
I love being a good student. I'm gonna go study."
"I used to smoke before bed, now I read Ok, I know it's not the same thing, but instead of thinking all day that I can't wait wait to go to bed to get high, now I'm excited to see what will happen in the next chapter. And weed made me lose so much time because sometimes I couldn't wait until night and I would lose the whole afternoon as well, but reading it's already fullfiling even if I have just 10 min before bed. I wake up much easier now and after 1 month I don't miss it anymore."
"""Weed makes you ok with being bored, and when you're bored, you should focus on improving yourself."" A friend told me this and it hit hard. But I already cook, exercise, read and travel extensively. How else can I focus on improving myself to stop weed? "
"All I want to do is inhale some jazz cabbage and watch the brave little toaster Im 28, It's been 5, almost 6 weeks since the last time I smoked after smoking nearly every day for the better part of 9 years. I stopped because it was not helping me; making me anxious, making me ruminate, making my physical activities not as fun, making me feel like I needed it to do anything at all, among other things. 

Since I havent been smoking I do feel more alive, more connected to my life and my surroundings, which is nice. Of course there's also a lot of me saying ""hey demons, it's your boy jibsauce,"" but that is to be expected. I'm proud of myself for not indulging myself thus far, and I guess I just wanted to voice my desire to watch the brave little toaster baked out of my gourd, even though I know it will probably not be as cool as I think its gonna be. 

Gonna go on a walk/meditate/journal/adventure now. Thanks for reading and I'm proud of you for your journey, wherever you are on it."
"Yo. Just wanted to say it’s been real. Thank you for all your stories. I won’t be here anymore. I went from smoking every single day to no smoking at all. I was smoking before work, during work, after work and until I passed tf out. This went on for two years. Before that cycle, I was an everyday smoker for 4 years in college. So that’s just a bit of a background. Today is the end of 65 days. This has been a really special week for me because I started running 3 miles everyday. I can already see an improvement. This has also been a special week because I’ve come to the realization that although I’ve been quitting a bunch of shit that’s not good for me over the past few years such as caffeine, alcohol, porn, I’ve failed to quit a subtle addiction that was holding me back. This is the internet. I never realized until recently how addicted I was. I wouldn’t really spend any time on YouTube or social media accounts but I would spend time here on reddit interacting with people I don’t even know. And it’s alright at first. Especially if the interaction is for your own personal development. I realized that soon I became dependent on certain type of posts that would give me a quick bit of dopamine. The search for good content is similar to the search for a good porn video. It’s crazy. Idk if I’m just super aware of it now that I’m clean, but I feel the release of dopamine whenever I see a good or funny post. Today I was at lunch and I noticed everyone was on there phone, scrolling through Instagram feeds, but they were still trying to have a convo. As in they’re giving their brains little bits of dopamine to feel good while having that conversation. I’ve also realized that whenever I would get home from work, I’d go straight to my room and read a bunch of posts and talk to people around the world and completely ignore the people who are actually in my life and who actually matter like my family. But it all seems good right? You’re working on yourself and it’s okay to be all caught up in your phone because it’s for your own good. No. There is something seriously wrong and twisted with how consumed we are by our devices and how much we neglect real life interactions for a quick bit of dopamine from a stupid post. I’m typing this to you because I feel like even though we quit weed, we’re still releasing dopamine through other outlets even the most subtle ones. People who were born when the internet came out and were unlucky not only battled a porn addiction but an addiction to wanting quick information. We’ve all been fucked up. I’m typing this now because I want to wish you all good luck in your journey. I won’t be on here anymore for a really long time. I’m done with these distractions in life. That’s all quick dopamine fix is, just distractions. You all saved my life. I love you all."
"Married, professional mom...and daily smoker x 14 years. My dirty little secret...(day 8) (long, sorry). This is my story that I am posting for me, really...but I needed to share, so thanks for this safe space. I started a new account as my other username is identifiable, so excuse my lack of karma/age.

I started smoking my sophomore year in college as part of a work hard - play hard mentality. I was in a tough major and would smoke after a long day of class and studying. I had goals firmly in mind and smoking never got in the way. 

Then at 22 I met my now husband, a daily user who was a totally functional stoner...and soon I was smoking during the day too, but still only if I had nothing else going on (class, etc.) Thus continued our relationship with each other and weed...through grad school (me) and entrepreneurship (him). 

Fast forward 14 years and we have 2 happy, healthy young kids, very successful careers, a nice house in the suburbs, etc. The picture of a perfect life despite continued daily use for us both. He still smokes more than I do as he can work stoned and I definitely cannot, but I would smoke after I got home from work and again before bed. I'm not much of a drinker so I considered smoking weed my equivalent of a ""glass of wine"" since that is so much more culturally acceptable. I didn't advertise my use to anyone. A few of our close friends knew I smoked occasionally, but none knew how much I really used.

I have felt guilty about smoking so much weed since having our first kid, and especially as she has gotten older and takes notice when we disappear into the garage for a few minutes. That being said, weed became legal in our state so it was easy to get, we had money for it and wasn't affecting our careers...so why stop? 

Well, 8 days ago we went on a family vacation to a state where we couldn't legally obtain any ganga and on day 3 I had severe anxiety. I have a history of depression/anxiety but suspected it was withdrawals...and when I realized my headaches and night sweats were likely symptoms too, I felt embarrassed. Embarrassed that a grown ass woman, a mom, a professional, was withdrawing from a drug she was addicted to.

I made the decision then and there to quit completely. My husband was reasonably stunned and worried that I would ""make"" him quit too, which I have no intention of doing - this is for me and me alone. Plus, I could stand to go without the nightly stoner carb binges! 

So last night was our first normal night at home after vacay and after we put the kids to bed, my first real craving hit (we always smoke together after they go to bed). Instead, my husband went out to the garage alone and afterwards we settled in together to watch our shows and snuggle and it was actually really enjoyable. I only ate 2 oreos as a bedtime snack (a feat of control not possible while high) and here I am on day 8...feeling happier, less ashamed, more clear-headed and with more desire to socialize than I have felt in years. AND 3lbs down!

I know this is the right path for me, and I am so thankful to this community as it has already given me so much strength and motivation. I can't tell really anyone in my life of my success because they never knew of my addiction, so thanks for listening, friends."
Just saw your post on trees Hey guys never heard of this thread but here i am... i promised my girl i would stop shes prego and my first born baby boy is coming in about a month and a half. I woke up wanting to blaze so bad i mean dont get me wrong i can and will stop but its hard. Hopefully someone replys and makes me feel a little better.  Anyway happy new years wish me luck
"So today was two weeks sober and I had a hard decision to make It was either pick up some of this fire looking bud that my old dealer sent me a pic of OR spend 30 dollars on that sushi I really wanted

I chose the sushi

Cheers to sobriety

Edit: thank you for all the support everyone! It really does help! This sub is amazing"
"Being sober offers a high of its own I’m only a week and a half in, so feel free to take what I say with a grain of salt. 

Today I felt something real, something palpable that I haven’t felt in years. It was like my body and mind were operating at peak efficiency and in perfect sync with one another. 

Woke up early (my sleep schedule is already 10x better than it was before I quit. Sleep from 12-9 or so instead of 4-1, but that’s beside the point), ate breakfast, and ran a few miles. That’s when I noticed how unbelievable I felt, both physically and mentally.

It was a feeling that had never been accomplished through chasing fleeting body highs. I felt for the first time in a long time that I was on the right track in life, offering a sense of accomplishment and a complete lack of guilt over my life choices, past and present. It embodied a feeling of almost child-like wonder, an overwhelming rush that made me just want to dance and celebrate, not giving a fuck about who was looking at me randomly exploding during a mid-day run. At first, I didn’t even know what to do with myself because I had no idea what was happening. But I’m here for all of it.

I think this is the way, ladies and gents"
Doing drugs is a very effective way to forget how happy you used to be That is all. But it is the truth.
"If you keep waiting for that “perfect final sesh” to quit, you will never quit. "
"The lies we tell ourselves regarding moderation As a long time lurker, I've felt such comfort in this sub when reading posts that relay the same feelings I've always held about my weed use and desire to quit. As such, I wanted to share some thoughts I had regarding moderation, and how I've always tried to quit with strings attached. 

I'm 27 now, but I first began smoking heavily around 21 while in college. Throughout college and grad school, I was better than my other friends at putting the weed away before finals, and that gave me a false sense of control over weed and my desire to always be high. In my mid-20s I began to notice the negative effects around smoking that we all know (ex. lack of motivation, complacency, lethargy, etc.), but my life was ""on track"", and on paper everything looked perfect, so I kept telling myself moderation was all I needed to achieve. 

I think I've considered and tried every level of moderation that exists, but each comes with its own awful effects: 

- **I'll only smoke on weekends!** (Which makes that feeling of ""living for the weekend"" so much worse, and makes the weekend fly by too fast while the week drags on). 

- **I'll only smoke on weekdays!** (The idea being that weekdays already suck, so might as well smoke to ease the stress of work, but all this does is make you dread every second of the workday even more so you can finally log-off, and having your weekend feel duller as you don't have weed to enjoy it)
- **I'll only smoke at night!** (Makes you sleep-in and ruins your mornings, and you don't want to get out of bed as every second of the day that goes by gets you closer to nighttime where you can finally smoke and relax)
- **I'll only smoke when my friends offer it to me!** (This makes you seek out your friends for the goal of getting high, or asking your friend for a nug to take home as you had such a fun time smoking with them)

 -**I'll only smoke on 4/20, or my birthday, or on vacation, or ...** (the ""special days"" that you can smoke began to add up, and you realize you always have weed leftover, so might as well smoke it all until it's done...)

- **I'll quit for a week/month/few months**  (This is my most common method. I gear up for one last big smoke sesh, and then proudly tell others I'm taking a break. ""See, I have it under control, I can quit for a week/month, so it's clearly not an issue."" But the deadline always makes you just count down the days until you can go back to being ""happy"". Every positive that comes with not smoking gets hampered by the fact that you know you're just waiting around to get back to it. How can you admit that you feel so much better, healthier, cleaner, energetic, etc. when you also know you are going to reintroduce weed back into your life? What ends up happening is you dive right back in, sometimes even deeper, and the cycle begins anew.)

Even now, telling myself that I need to quit forever is tough. Like so many of you, weed has opened my mind and given me so many positive experiences. But I know that my relationship with weed is now a toxic one that only keeps me emotionally and physically stunted as the years march on. And I know now that my dreams of smoking in moderation are just ways to make sure I never truly have to grow and deal with the underlying issues of my addiction. 

Weed is nefarious in that others don't clearly see the issues of your use, but it slowly chips away at your spirit. Your eyes lose a light that you know was once there. Typing this out has helped me understand that what I really need is to quit wholeheartedly. I'm so thankful that this sub exists and I hope this post can help someone as so many posts have helped me.

EDIT: With all this said, I do believe moderation has helped me throughout my life, and I'm certain others are able to moderate their use and find a healthy middle-ground in their relationship with weed. I just know personally that I use moderation as a crutch, and have slowly come to the realization that I must give up weed for a long period of time before I even consider reintroducing it into my life."
"Weed makes you forget how to take care of your brain For context, I'm taking a human development course that includes watching old informational videos about how to help infants develop cognition and language skills. Whenever the narrator in these videos talks about how to foster growth and well-being, I realize how much my habit messes with this stuff. Variation of stimuli? Many of us are content to watch and do the exact same things over and over when we are high. Regular daily schedule? Sometimes I would stay up until four in the morning while smoking, sometimes I would go to bed at five o'clock because I was exhausted from being up all night. Reciprocal interaction? Nah, I'd rather be alone and think the same things I always have. I don't know if weed made me any dumber, but I sure as hell know it wasn't making me smarter. I've thought these kinds of things before, but something about watching babies say their first words after months of producing incoherent babblespeak woke me up."
"Underrated benefit: brushing teeth Whenever I would smoke, I would always just pass out and never consider brushing my teeth before bed. Now I feel gross going to bed without brushing my teeth."
"Hi my name is Ray and I'm an Addict Hi everyone I've wanted to post this for awhile. I want to do 3 things with this post, demystify the presumptions of marijuana addiction, tell my story about being in recovery, and allow anyone who has questions about sobriety to reach out.

I just past 1 year of sobriety, after 8 years of daily smoking from the age of 18 to 26. I lived a life of being a complete slave to marijuana. I needed it to eat. I needed it to sleep. I needed it to hang out with friends. I needed it like my body needs water.

I didn't really know anything else. This just seemed normal. 

Then one day my girlfriend of 5 years gave me an ultimatum. Either quit smoking weed or she's leaving. 

This hit me hard. I didn't want to lose pot. Pot was my medicine.... But I also didn't want to lose the love of my life. I knew pot was a problem .... But society told me it wasn't addictive. So what the hell do I do...

It took some time but I finally mustered up the courage to call a local therapist. Fucking expensive but it was something I had to do.

I went, and hated it. I hated admitting I had a problem, I hated pretending like I wanted to quit. In reality I wanted her to wave a magic wand to take away my addiction so I could just smoke weed on weekends or something.

This is not how recovery works.

I kept going back because I had to. Until one day she handed me a booklet called ""core beliefs"". This is what changed everything for me....

I learned addiction is not actually the problem... It's the solution. The actual problem are my negative core beliefs about myself and character defects that *cause* me to be an addict.

This hit me hard. 

For me, my defects of character are low self esteem. I built an ego to protect myself from dealing with my insecurities (a common defect). I was a chronic perfectionist, nothing was ever good enough. Another sign of insecurity.

I grew up with big dreams and aspirations, but never lived up to them. This taught me it was these very character defects that caused me to never succeed (or even try), and in order to deal with that stress/pressure I would use. My addiction was the solution. A terrible solution.

It still took me a few weeks to finally say goodbye... Because I knew I had to say goodbye forever. 

Once I finally quit for a day, i attended my first Marijuana Anonymous meeting. I really hated it. To have to sit in a room and admit my problem? Fuck that. I collected my welcome chip anyway, and the second the meeting ended I tried to get out. But a gentleman by the name of Amin stopped me and asked how I was doing.

I told him the truth that i didn't want to do this but I had to... That I was scared. 

He said ""You know Ray, of all the 12 steps, only the first step actually talks about marijuana""

This helped. It made me realize even more that recovery was about working on myself, and not on my addiction.

Still, my addict brain was strong. I went back to my therapist and told her I hated MA and thought it was stupid"".

She said ""you're right Ray. It is stupid.

And it works""

So I kept coming back.

I went through the physical bullshit... No eating, no sleeping, irritability, night sweats. (Skip to the bottom of this post for tricks to get through this.)


I heard stories of people who actually told me sobriety was BETTER than using. At the time, I thought they were full of shit... but I had to trust them... I had to to keep that motivation. 

After a couple weeks I started slowly feeling a bit better. I started coming around to the meetings and actually begun to share . Sometimes. Lol.

As time went on I kept doing the work. I went through the steps with my therapist. A painful experience. But i worked the program.

In took about a month to start noticing changes in my behaviour. 

I kept going back to meetings. I started actually enjoying the meetings. Being around a bunch of people going through the same bullshit as me.... With a drug that society laughs at you for having an addiction with.... It was the only place I could be completely honest.

Fast forward 12 months.

Here I am. 1 year sober and I notice my character defects going away. I'm not worried what people think of me, I do what I want and say what I want without that voice telling me whatever bullshit. I've started building my dream this past week. A blog about my passions. Something I would NEVER do as an insecure addict. I can live a life of total freedom now.

I can totally and honestly say sobriety is WAY FUCKING BETTER than using.

If you only take away one thing from this post make it this.... *Recovery gives you everything weed promised.*

I now go to multiple meetings a week. Because I want to. I host an MA meeting at a rehab centre as well. Helping inpatient addicts weekly. Holy fucking rewarding that is.

To tell you what I've lost since the day I quit weed:
- I lost my job
- I lost my condo (my favourite location of all time)
- I lost my girlfriend (after 5 Months of sobriety we actually decided to mutually end the 5 year relationship)
- I lost my business I had started
- my dog died

And I can 100% honestly say I would trade all of those losts TEN FOLD for the emotional wellbeing I get to experience today. I'm doing things here at 27 I never thought I'd be able to do. Living in peace with myself. Enjoying life.

I still have a lot to work on. But holy shit the amount of change in myself I've done in a year.... I never thought I could get here and yet only a year later and I'm doing things I never thought I could do. 

Somebody passed me a joint at a party couple weekends ago and it made me laugh... why the fuck would I smoke this... The emotional rewards are worth WAY more than this joint. And yet one year ago I was smoking 3.5 grams of this shit a day.

This freedom... It's worth it. I'm no longer a slave to marijuana. But most importantly, I'm no longer a slave to my brain.

Thank you for letting me be of service. 

Please, if you have ANY questions about recovery/sobriety/MA, please ask me anything. I'm an open book.

Bonus:
Marijuana anonymous: http://marijuana-anonymous.org (HIGHLY RECOMMEND A RECOVERY PROGRAM. A SOBER ADDICT WITHOUT A PROGRAM IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN)

If there's no MA in your town go to Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or AA meetings . Pretty much the same structure.

You can also download the FREE MA app with all readings, step work etc. Available on app store.

Cold turkey or weaning: 
There's no such thing for an addict as weaning off weed. You're an addict. Weaning off isn't fixing anything. When I first quit weed I had to quit every mind altering substance (alcohol). Because I lost these dopamine rushes.... I had the most sex I've ever had in my life.... I ate fast food daily, cookies, candy... Because I'm an addict and I need that rush. In order to truly fix the addiction, cold turkey is the only solution.

How to deal with physical symptoms: (for me they lasted about 2 weeks)....

Sleep - wooooorkouttttt. Sweat it out like crazy. This will also help with food. Also go to the pharmacy and purchase Melatonin. Its the natural chemical in your brain that tells your body to go to sleep. It stops working when you smoke so much dope.

Food - smoothies. I couldn't get anything down.... Was never hungry. Make smoothies because not eating is very unhealthy

Night sweats - extra sheets. Necessary evil for me... The more sweats the better the dreams in a couple weeks

Cravings - every time you resist a craving... The cravings power lessons. 

Irritability - move your body. And don't trust ANY emotion for the first few weeks. Your body is trying to fight you to get it's fix.. he/she is NOT happy.

How to actually quit. - give yourself enough of a reason.... A purpose for quitting. I experienced enough pain from my character defects controlling me that motivation to fix them is very strong.
WRITE THIS MOTIVATION DOWN. Your brain is going to try and trick you into using.

I've met people that went homeless, psychotic, handcuffed to hospital beds, living off park benches, all from weed.

This is not the same drug as your parents smoked.

The addiction components of this drug are seriously real. Do NOT let anyone tell you otherwise...."
"Just wanted to shout-out how incredible this whole sub is. I just messed up my day 1 after only an hour of waking up, but coming back here and checking this sub reminds me there is still hope. I will get there, things are just hard... I have been lurking this sub for a long time on and off over the years. Weed has been steady in my life since I was 15 and I am now 26. I have been a daily smoker for at least the past few years now, time is so blurred together it is hard to keep track. In the past year I made the realization marijuana is holding me back but every time I try to quit I end up reverting back to it. 

The past few months have been hell for me for a lot of reasons, but the past couple of weeks I went off of my antidepressants cold-turkey and have been in severe physical and mental withdrawal. I used weed to help cope as usual and it honestly made me feel worse - more nauseous, more angry. And I decided once I got my meds back again (which I did last night) That I would stop smoking weed for good, or at least for a while. I decided I need to stop neglecting my medication and mental health for a life of getting high to numb the pain, even though it has comforted me so much it has taken over my life and kept me stuck for too long. So this morning, back on my meds and motivated and finally not feeling sick to my stomach, I decided I was going to start today. 

It's only 920 and I already fucked that up. I just was so bored and laying here not motivated and just could not stop thinking about how if I just take a hit it would help even it out. So I packed a bowl and did just that, because for some reason my self control is that of a 5 year old. Trying not to hate on myself right now, so I went back to this sub to read everyone's words of wisdom instead. 

Reading all the posts on the front page of leaves instead of dwelling in my fuck up is making me feel better. I am still disappointed that I did this, but I know it is not a linear battle and I have given up vices before - weed just time and time again has proven to be the hardest one for me to let go of. I tend to give up and beat myself up when I make mistakes like this and then throw the whole thing away altogether, but no. I am not going to let this one hit ruin what could be a good rest of day 1. I am determined and I have seen how strong all of you are and how far all of you have come - if all of these people can do it, who says I can't too? The support and positive vibes around here is incredible. I want to be free of this addiction so I can feel that too. 

Sorry for the rant, but I guess what I am trying to say thanks all of you for reminding me that I got this and allowing me to not let one impulsive bong hit turn into a full day of binge smoking. Now I am putting the bong away and going to do a barre workout so I can get some natural endorphins and restart my day off right :) Hope you all have a fantastic day!"
"8 Months! I barely recognize myself from before. I smoked daily for over 10 years. When I quit I was depressed, unmotivated, isolated, and hated myself.

Today I feel so much better. I have the motivation to improve myself in so many other ways, and putting in effort for a better future. I no longer hate myself - I actually kind of like myself - and I think that has made it easier for other people to like me too.

It was hard in the beginning but I am so glad I stuck with it. I feel like a new person and I was desperate to be where I am now. If you are struggling please hang in there. It gets easier and its so worth it."
"Pot is addictive I was one of those stoners who believed that you couldn't get addicted to pot. It's non-addictive! Wrong. My brain makes up reasons to smoke = Addiction. I don't feel like I can get anything done until I smoke = Addiction. You can't overdose! Wrong. I overdose every day, it just doesn't kill me. My body doesn't feel as many physical effects from it now because I smoke so much = Overdose. But it does kill my motivation and my drive to be a better person. I live the same exact day every day because of pot. Yes it may not be as bad as harder drugs or alcohol, but I am not living a good life this way. It is covering up everything I need to deal with mentally and emotionally and is the reason I haven't progressed as far in life as I had wanted. I've tried to quit in the past, but never under the guise of an addict. I realized that if I swapped a bowl with a shot, I would be hammered by noon. If this isn't addiction, then I don't know what is. My therapist recommended I try AA meetings or something similar. I just get so annoyed now when I hear people say that it isn't addictive. I used to be one of those people, but I think that was what helped me think it was okay to smoke every day.  That's what makes it so dangerous. Thank you for whoever listens to this rant. I just am having difficulty getting to the next step of actually quitting."
"19 years old, my story, and how my best friend‘s weed habit ultimately resulted in schizophrenia. Please read. I am two weeks sober. I’m relatively young dude (19 years old) compared to many on here. I was dependent on weed for two years. I tried to quit the herb many times, but I truly believe this time is different.

Let me tell you my story.

My post history on reddit is a firsthand example of the mental toll this drug has taken on me over the last two years. I went from a motivated, high achieving student religiously posting on college subreddits to a complete stoner (and anxious wreck) warning those on /r/oilpen about fake carts. Like many of you, I told myself the lie I was capable of being a “high-functioning” stoner. In reality, I became a “barely-functioning” addict.

Coming out of high school, I was accepted to a top twenty university on a full scholarship. I decided to take it easy senior year, which is when I let myself go & became a complete weed fiend. I absolutely loved weed at first, somehow way more than most. I told myself I would quit when I went to to college.

I distinctly remember meeting my roommate (now one of my best friends) freshman year of college. Let’s call him P. When I first met him, I remember trying to feel P out & contemplating whether or not I should tell him about my habit. Both of us quite shy, I decided to ask him if he had smoked weed in high school. He responded with a resounding “Yes!” and that he had been fiending since senior year as well. Ten minutes later, we both whipped out our dab pens & the rest was history. We smoked every single day to the point where it became a ritual. We figured that we were young & that we should live it up our freshman year. I was soon FULLY dependent marijuana (specifically wax) and was getting high all day everyday. This went on for nearly 2 years.

Fast forward to first semester sophomore year (last semester), P and I were still toking it up like crazy with only vague intentions to stop. All of the sudden, at the beginning of last semester, P became quiet, sleepy, and more unmotivated than usual. Something was off, and I assumed it was depression at first. I made the huge mistake of continuing to enable P by smoking in our dorm room and he never truly ended up quitting despite his intentions.

This last semester, not a whole lot changed regarding our pot use. We kept smoking and smoking, but this time we managed to taper down & stick to just flower. P, however, was still acting off when he wasn’t high and I decided to finally confront him about it. He revealed to me that had been hearing voices for the past year. These voices were preventing from concentrating in school & confining him to his bed all day. Upon hearing this, I broke down. It all made sense. When we were high, so many times had P told me superstitious shit & how he was “communicating with God”. I would just tell him that he was high as fuck and just trippin’ & we’d just laugh it off. Little did I know that P was literally HEARING a discourse between God and the Devil in his mind. When he broke the news that he was hearing voices & these voices were perpetually throwing him into a debilitated state, I realized he likely had schizophrenia. Upon this realization, I tearfully asked P, “What if you hadn’t smoked weed to begin with? You think things would be different?” He revealed to me that ever since he smoked marijuana in high school, something was “off” in his mind and he couldn’t quite point his finger on it. As he continued to smoke like crazy alongside me, his condition worsened to what it is today.

I’m not suggesting that marijuana is the culprit for psychosis & schizophrenia. I do know though that it can bring out these conditions in those that are at risk of developing them (like P was, even though he had no idea). I was affected by the plant differently. Persistent, hourly exposure to very high THC levels led to severe anxiety to the point where it was debilitating, triggering multiple mental breakdowns throughout freshman year. I somehow continued to smoke to quell this anxiety, which became a vicious cycle and exacerbated it in the long run. No matter how much I wanted to smoke in moderation, I just couldn’t do it because I was fully addicted.

P and I are still very close friends & have gone back home because of this corona shit. P, who stills hears voices everyday, has been sober for over a month. I’ve been sober for two weeks. We are supporting each other in this journey and I aspire to one day attend medical school & specialize in psychiatry so I can help P and those suffering from similar conditions. As an addict myself, I have taken an interest in studying addictions and also intend to go into addiction psychiatry.

These past two weeks, I have gotten intense cravings & thought of kickin’ it and smoking a joint is so enticing. However, I have taken comfort in knowing that my anxiety has vanished. The mental clarity is phenomenal. I have aced all of my exams this past week, something I’ve never done during my time in college. I feel so much more confident in my abilities. I also have an extremely supportive girlfriend (who I love deeply) that tells me everyday I made the correct decision.

Whenever I get the urge to smoke, I just think about all the negative shit this plant has caused all of us. It has blunted us, made us perpetually  lazy, and has sapped us of our intrinsic human motivation to better ourselves. It ultimately destroyed my best friend.

I’m never going back and this post can hold me accountable.

\[Edit\] Let me make something clear guys. I am not staying weed was the CAUSE of P's schizophrenia. According to the scientific literature, the cause is likely attributed to an underlying genetic abnormality and/or environmental factors such as exposure to teratogens. All I'm saying is that marijuana certainly exacerbated his condition and served as a pivotal trigger. Upon smoking for the first time, P reported he had never felt the same and that something was off, even if hadn't developed the condition right off the bat. It may have been entirely possible he would have developed the condition anyway if he hadn't smoked weed but my gut tells me otherwise.

\[Edit\] Thanks for the silver & gold. Here's to a life of purpose, confidence, and NEVER giving in!"
"Inspired by 150 days clean post I checked my sobriety counter, 273 days clean. Here’s my story of how my extreme abuse of dabs *actually* almost killed me. It’s a very long and complicated story but I was addicted to weed. I smoked 30+ dabs a day from my dab pen, live in a state where it’s plentiful and cheap. It triggered something called marijuana induced hyperemesis that caused me to throw up uncontrollably for so long o had to go to the emergency room 6+ times in two years for fluids and weapons grade anti nausea medicine. This in addition to 5 hot yoga classes a week weakened my heart and I didn’t know it. 


Vomiting and dabs can have a negative effect on your heart and so I went in for a short surgical procedure to have a lip cyst removed and the anesthesia stressed my heart to the point that it malformed (called broken heart dz) and triggered a domino effect of organ failure. I was in a coma for ten days and the shock caused my right leg to die from lack of blood supply. I was on dialysis, a heart and kidney transplant list, on a heart/lung bypass machine called an ECMO that oxygenated and warmed my blood for me. I didn’t end up needing a transplant but I did become an amputee at 23. I did suffer actual withdrawals from dabs, in that I couldn’t keep any food down the entire month I was in the hospital and I lost a lot of weight. 


I’m 25 now, I recorded a podcast episode for This is Actually Happening episode 135 with the full story if anyone is interested. But when I tell my story now I get hate by people telling me I’m lying and shit. It’s not that weed in itself is harmful, but I’m an addict and I can abuse anything to the point of harming myself. And I did. After I stopped smoking I became an alcoholic for a short period of time before I finally hit rock bottom and gave up booze too. So.. here I am 273 days sober. I miss it sometimes but I remind myself that I am incapable of using it responsibly and so I’ve lost the privilege. If you have any questions about my sobriety or the amputation feel free to ask."
"Sober for 1 year as of today!!! I love being off of weed, my memory and overall being has improved so much, I'm never turning back
You can do it too
I smoked daily for 15 years, very heavy user"
"The real challenge begins when the “high” of sobriety wears off, and you settle down into the realities of your life. Stay strong, lean on whomever you have to, and take it one day at a time. 25 days sober, the longest I’ve gone in ~15 years. Everything past 22 days is new ground, untouched territory. 

I’m feeling good about it all, but I’m also feeling what I put in the title, like the endorphin rush from the initial sobriety has worn off, and now all that is left is just life itself, for better or for worse. 

This feeling is hard to describe, I don’t think it’s a negative thing, but maybe not exactly positive either. Can anyone relate?"
"I didn't quit to feel better, I quit so I can feel the pain of my lifestyle. I just realized this. Weed enabled me to live a shitty unfulfilled life and not give a shit. So quitting isn't going to miracuously make my life better. It's going to make me actually feel shitty about habits like isolating, passively distracting myself and not making any decisions to change. This is why it's been so hard for me to quit. I've been smoking for 15+ years.

I'm aproaching 60 days clean and this is when I usual give up because I don't feel any better or I feel worse then I did smoking 2g a day. 

This time I'm going to accept that I feel lousy and use it as a catalyst to slowly change my lifestyle. I don't know exactly what I want my life to look like but I'm gonna start by slowly making the changes that I see a lot of you fellow Leavers are making. I'm not gonna get caught up in the woe is me 'I don't feel any better so I might as well smoke' mindset this time around. 

Acceptance, Work and Patience will be my mantra "
"I found half a joint in the ashtray in my car ...and I held it for a minute, and smelled it, and then tore it open and scattered the cannabis in my yard so I couldn't smoke it. :)"
Full two months of sobriety. 
"ONE YEAR CLEAN!! 365 DAYS!!! I did it!! I fucking did it, never thought it was possible. 

Thank you all at this subreddit. 


If anybody wonders how life improved since I quit and wants inspiration.

1) Promotion to a better job
2) Lost 30+ pounds
3) Learning to drive
4) Reading regularly 
5) Mental health significantly better 
6) Sleep better 
7) Physical health much better 

If anybody has any questions I’m happy to answer.

Keep up the fight everybody still going.


Edit: thank you for your kind words everybody, I will try to reply to every comment."
"365 days clean :) I did it! i made it one whole year without consuming cannabis. I’ve set a New Years resolution every year for the past few years: writing in a journal every night, no meat, no soda, and this year no weed.  Because I’ve successfully done other resolutions, I knew I could do it. But this one was harder than the others for sure; especially because I didn’t consume meat or soda every day, and the journaling was a new habit. 

After about two months, I began to dream again (remember them the next morning, at least). Also began feeling emotions again– no more being a zombie, dragging his feet along in life.  I’ve felt happiness again, as opposed to just joy from having some laughs, kickin back, and smoking a joint with the homies

I’ve saved quite a bit of money, no exact dollar amount but I know there is an app out there (that I definitely plan on downloading this next year) that tells you how much money you’ve saved from not buying bags every week.

If you’re interested in giving it a try, I say start tonight at the start of the new year. Take it one month at a time!  Don’t set out thinking, “I’m gonna go a full year without this!”  Just think, “I’m gonna go a full month without this!”
If you think it’ll help, reward yourself at the end of each month: buy yourself something nice with the money you would’ve spent on bags but instead you saved (congrats!). Or if you really must, smoke a bowl :)
Or if you‘s rather, plan 3 or 6 months in advance with a bigger reward: a trip somewhere, a new computer, a new upgrade for your car/house, etc. 

I’ve been living a HAPPIER life without weed. For a while I considered smoking on January 1st, at least to see if I’d still like it, but I’ve lost interest in smoking. I can still appreciate the plant however. When friends smoke, I no longer have the urge to join them, but instead admire and appreciate it without partaking. Please feel free to PM me if you ever need some kind of encouragement or whatever :)"
"My list of unexpected/ less often mentioned benefits [UPDATE] /OG post below/ It’s been 23 hours since this post and I’m so glad that it resonated with many of you. While replying to your messages and comments, I realized that I wanted to share my side because I feel like this addiction and sub needs the focus on positivity to keep going. Don’t count days, focus on what you lose but what you gain. 

I shared my post with my (not smoker) BF. He admitted that it’s been depressing seeing me stoned, dumbed down and pointless. I’m a different person since stopping and it’s been a realization for me to admit that it’s not just myself that notices the changes. 

Keep adding to the list, keep embracing your journey and keep supporting quiet lurkers! Thank you so so much for all of you, you are all amazing!

Ps: and thank you for the awards, it’s really the cherry on top :)


—————-original post—————

Dear leavers, I’m a loooong time lurker. Been clean for about 8 months now, but I have not been counting the days, can’t really even remember my last joint. Kicked the habit after 7 years of daily use.
The last months of smoking were just full of self loathing, smoking miserably while reading your posts and deciding every time that I’ll quit after this one. After long build up, I succeeded. Since then, I tried not giving too much importance to smoking in my head and been appreciating all the little things that I can do/enjoy now in my every days. Hopefully it inspires some of you, just like you motivated me. I tried collecting some things that I don’t see that often in this sub, I think you are all so great with expressing the main learnings, ups and downs of what we are going through. 

So here it goes:

- being able to answer calls, receive guests, visit friends/neighbors with last minute notice. No need to plan my social life around being high.
- open my doors with pride. I used to be paranoid about the smell for anyone coming to visit or stay-over guests finding my stash accidentally. Especially paranoid with family, the thought of my mom finding my stash gave me panic attacks.
- get lost in the house holding chores and other activities that I used to always get high before. I’d smoke before folding laundry or doing a batch of dishes (if even doing it), just to break the monotony. Now I listen to podcasts, audiobooks, zone out and I’m happy about it.
- spontaneously get on my bike, go for a walk, leave the house to enjoy the weather or something I’m listening to AND do it any time!— not dreading leaving the house, not planning days around when I’ll be a couch potato.
- planning and making healthy meals, weekly mealplans- I didn’t have the energy and couldn’t keep coherent enough thoughts, focus and memory to plan.
- planning anything in general. Trips, next projects, calendar, home improvements...- having focus+memory combo back is priceless
- brushing teeth, caring for personal hygiene, even enjoying it
- starting and finishing projects, hobbies around the house - I learned to sew, plant veggies, upholster.. all things I’ve been putting out while high
- no ashes, no stashes, no stench, no fear of neighbors, police
- enjoying one-on-one conversations, getting deep in somebody’s story, friend or stranger - I’m not scared of people anymore and gained my interest back in others
- not caring what people think - weed used to make me paranoid just walking down the street. I used to think everybody is staring at me, judging and I had a sad narration of what they must be thinking about me.
- not thinking of myself as an addict or as a functioning person with a secret “hobby” - I’m more forward with who I am, open up to people more easily, proud of what I achieved as a person - for what I do, not despite what I do 

Thank you for everything for this community! I’m going back to lurking."
"Day 2. Wow!!! Who would of thought former plug and a person who smoked 3 to 5 blunts per day for the past 6 years would finally quit. I know it’s going to be a long journey. I couldn’t sleep last night, no appetite no motivation but I’m pushing through. You all have been a great inspiration. "
"Finally, after 17 years of smoking almost daily, I achieved what I thought was impossible. This is the longest I've ever gone without and I won't be slowing my momentum toward a better life I've now gone without weed for 22 days, my previous best being 21 days with dozens of attempts lasting only a day or two. I still have an active MMJ prescription and all my paraphernalia, and regardless of that I still quit, this time for good.

These past three weeks have been some of the best of my life. I broke up with my lying, cheating girlfriend, quit alcohol, weed, soda and caffeine, started writing a book, organized my life and possessions, started exercising daily, quit playing video games and now only watch tv while eating, read a few hours a day, started meditating and putting a lot more effort into my hobbies, the list goes on and on. 

What started all of this was the added clarity and motivation in finally giving up weed and in large part that's due to the community here so I really just wanted to say thanks. Thank you to everyone who posts here and shares their stories and successes no matter how big or small. I thought I'd never be able to enjoy the things in my life without being high all the time and that couldn't be farther from the truth. My life has become so much better without it. It's cliche as all hell but I truly believe that if I can do it, you can too. Best of luck to everyone on their journey and have a safe weekend. :)"
"6 months weed free! 🥳🥳 
I'm sitting here in the middle of a heatwave, sweating my arse off, full of celebratory curry and stone cold sober. Bit different to 6 months ago when I was withdrawing that's for sure!

Many times I've doubted myself this last half a year but never completely. Somehow I've always talked myself out of giving in.

Life ain't roses but it sure smells better sober. Feels better sober.

Whatever is next I'm ready for. Can't give up now, my future happiness depends on it.

Up yours PAWS, I'm not giving in.

Much love all, stay strong 🤍"
"4 years clean and sober today. Hello all.   7 years no booze, 4 years no weed today.   


I never ever get cravings anymore.  It’s great to be free."
"Day 3000: A life changing decision This month marks my 3000th day in a row as a non-smoker. 8 years ago, I had smoked cannabis for more than 10 years just about every single day, from my teens to my twenties. Im now in my thirties. 

Back then, I had some breaks lasting weeks now and then, but never managed to kick the habit completely. In fact, towards the later years of my smoking career, I was in a cycle of quitting and relapsing. I had A LOT of first days of quitting. Like hundreds. I had many times where I would get through the hardest early weeks of restlesness, sweaty nights, mood swings and general discomfort, and then relapse when I started to return to a normal state. Returning to baseline somehow seemed to lower my guard and I began forget why I wanted to quit in the first place, and would talk myself into smoking again.

The last time I smoked I had been on a vacation in a foreign country where I was abstinent for 3 weeks. I came home and relapsed the first weekend while drunk, I felt like shit and decided to quit again. This time I joined a gym monday and started working out seriously. I had always kept in decent shape, but now I finally decided to make it a central focus of my life. With that decision, I had found what needed to replace my weed addiction. I was a compulsive smoker, now I could use the same habit driven determination to become a better athlete. Once I got going it felt so nice, and once I started noticing improvements in my life, I then knew that returning to the old ways of smoking ment I would lose it all. And that deterred me from relapsing. But I had to get the ball rolling. My many past experiences of relapsing also helped me predict vulnerable situations I could then prevent, by making the right decision preemptively instead of being impulsive and relapsing.

Finding new dimensions of my identity was the hardest. I had to figure out who I was as an adult without weed, a companion that had followed me through my developing years into adulthood. Weed is like your best friend you always know where you have. It was linked to almost all aspects of my life: Who I was, where I went and what I did. Letting go of that relationship and moving forward into new territory feels uncomfortable. But in order to grow as a person, old ways sometimes need to die. Speaking of friends, almost all my friends smoked. Since most were good friends, and still are today, I needed to become a no-man when it came to getting high together. Saying ""no thanks"" is hard, but really powerful. This also inspired some friends to quit themselves. Some still smoke today on their 15-20th year, but some have quit. Guess who have matured the most?

Looking back now, man have I grown. Since kicking the habit, I now have a college degree, a loving family, and I am in the best shape of my life, physically and mentally. The memory and foggy mind cleared up. The depression and anhedonia have improved considerably. The anxiety is gone. I sleep well. Of course I still have ups and downs like everyone else, but everything became much easier. I'm positive I would not have the same quality of life today, if I had kept on smoking.

The addiction is like malware in your operating system. It creates pop-up spam with cravings and smoking ideas. The pop ups are sometimes random, but are usually triggered by stimuli that are associated with the feeling of getting high, such as after eating, before sleeping, being with friends, watching a movie, etc. Even negative emotions works as triggers if you are used to smoking when you feel sad. The good news is that as time without smoking passes, the pop ups fade. In the beginning I would think about smoking many times a day, even many times an hour. Then it was a few times a week. Then a few times a month. Now the thought may cross my mind rarely, but it's more of a nostalgic memory than a real desire to smoke. So if you are struggling with repeated thoughts about smoking, give your mind time to let go of the old habits, and remember that you are not your thoughts.

This post is becoming long, but I wanted to tell my story and I hope it will inspire you to quit for good. Cannabis wont kill you, but it will prevent you from reaching your potential. I don't know about you, but I want to make the most of my life. I know that wont happen if I sit on my couch being high, dreaming about what I could have done.

Some tips:

1 - Find a hobby you can invest your time and energy into that brings you growth and happiness: Learn to play the piano. Learn a martial art. Paint. Run. Read books. Lift weights. Go fishing. Pick up something that you used to do, but forgot about, or try something new. Join a community where (*insert hobby) is the focus. Do whatever you like, just do something else than smoke, it will help filling the void. If you pick a social hobby that's a great way to meet people that you can hang around with where smoking is not the focus.

2 - Exercise. It improves sleep, depression and helps you feel better. It gives you goals you can focus on with your newfound spare time. Tip 1 and 2 can be combined. That's what I did.

3 - Involve your close ones in your decision. They can help you when you are feeling down. They can better cope with your mood swings if they know the reason behind. You will feel responsible for sticking with the decision, to not let them down.

4 - If you relapse, take it as a learning experience and don't be too hard on yourself. Yes you will feel guilt, but try to make the most of it. Figure out what went wrong. Was it the physical discomfort? Was it social pressure? Was it restlessness and boredom? Was it because of a bad day? How did you feel? Who were you with? Use the insights to make smarter decisions going forward.

Feel free to ask me questions.

TLDR; I quit after more than a decade of daily cannabis smoking. My life quality has since improved a lot. You can do it too."
"Free of Weed for 50 Days! When I first started I didn't know how long I was stopping for. I just knew I had to quit.   


I was sick of my head being cloudy, feeling like I was getting stupider every day, and doing the same thing day in and day out.  
I smoked every day for 10 years after 5:30 pm (earlier on weekends). I did it mostly alone because I hated ""stoners"" who made weed their whole life....thinking I was different because I just smoked in the evenings and was highly functional in life. But I realized that I *was* a stoner and it *had* become my life. I got anxious being away from my house (where the weed was). I got anxious thinking about moving or traveling to somewhere I couldn't freely and easily consume cannabis. I got anxious thinking about drug tests. I got anxious thinking about having to drive anytime after 5:00 pm. I planned everything around cannabis.   


I was 100% addicted. I still am.   
I know I will never have a healthy relationship with cannabis and because of that, it cannot be part of my life.  


I'm so glad I quit.

If it's day 1 or day 0 for you, just listen to yourself. If a voice keeps telling you to quit: listen to it!  
Take it day by day.  
Eventually, 1 day will become a week, a week will become a month, and a month will become 50 days! Stoked for 60 days, 90 days, 6 months...and many, many more milestones after that!  


Thanks for all the support, weed-free fam bam!"
"Fuck weed I am on Day 6 after more than 15 years of regular use and several years of heavy daily use.  I have tried and failed to quit dozens of times.  Weed has nearly destroyed my marriage, damaged my relationship with my children, and hampered my career for too long.  Fuck weed.  I am no longer giving it power over me.  I won't let my brain tell me it's fine to smoke ""just once a week"" when I know damn well that it leads back to constant use in just a few weeks... every time.

I am 38 years old, and I'm so much better than the stoner that I've become.  I'm over it.  Disenchanted.  It's not cool.

If you are 15, or 20, or even 30 years old and you smoke more than you'd like, stop now.  Don't cut back.  Don't take a break.  Stop.  If you didn't have a problem, you probably wouldn't be on this sub, and if you think you might have a problem, you probably do.  Every day you allow smoking to become more ingrained into your routine is a day you're getting closer to becoming a life-long stoner who is unable to put anything, including yourself, before getting high.

Some people can do it every once and a while and it's fine.  Some people can even do it once a day or 3 times a week, and they never feel the need to increase their use.  Good for them, but we're not them.  Stop pretending it's fine, because it's not.  The sooner we can realize that it's causing nothing but pain, the sooner we can say ""fuck weed"" and work towards being ourselves again.

Thanks for listening."
A HUGE SHOUTOUT TO ALL DADS OUT THERE QUITTING. I CANT EVEN IMAGINE TRYING TO TACKLE THIS WHILE TAKING CARE OF MY KIDS. YALL SOME REAL ONES 
"Funny how time changes you I remember during university where smoking weed was this cool lifestyle choice and meant having fun with friends, having some laughs, exploring a new subculture. Then university ends but the party can keep going right? Weed was just an unfairly stereotyped drug with no downsides, if only more people smoked the world would be a better place.

Then the chilling with friends and smoking became smoking a bowl alone and watching some tv or playing video games. Still a great time though right? This was the life! Then slowly your hobbies start dropping away and you find yourself dealing with anxiety when hanging out with friends, sober or high. Then you miss a few important events because you were getting high and it's not a big deal anyway right? People need to chill out.

Then the years and the smoking keep going and you realise that maybe the weed use isn't all good. Maybe the reason you were using it so heavily wasn't because it was so much fun, but because there are some realities you don't want to confront. Maybe the world isn't quite how you imagined it to be, or you aren't the person you thought you were. Then every bowl, every spliff, every vape is just another way of hiding from your own life. Hiding from your ambitions and the chance you might fail, hiding from rejection that would prove you weren't good enough as you always thought.

2 weeks today and no intention of smoking for the rest of 2019. It's time to go outside and face the world."
Showed my boyfriend the /leaves community for the first time last night! 
"Don't replace the addiction with sobriety...Replace the addiction with an adventure so big you have to be sober... The addiction is a substitute for that adventure.  My vision is to be one of the most recognized and powerful figures in my field, and that means that I can't be high in order to get there.  What's your adventure?"
"Day 29 and I’ve been crying all day Literally ugly sobbing. I guess everyone was right when they said suppressing your emotions for 20 years would come back and hit you like a freight train. 

I am fucking exhausted."
"Haven’t smoked since I’ve been awake only 30 minutes so far Haven’t smoked yet as I’m writing this for some courage and motivation to not smoke my wax pen. I don’t want to be dependent on this beautiful substance anymore. I want to be my normal sober self. I don’t even like getting smacked anymore or high. I just do it to be happy but when I smoke I feel regret.
We got this Leaves! One day at a time

EDIT- Thank you guys so much for all the kind words and advice! I haven’t been able to read everything yet as I’m still cleaning the glass out of my car, I am seeing the notifications pop up and that’s really giving me the extra strength I need so thank you!! I’ll be getting back to you all as soon as I can! :)

EDIT 2- I have been reading the replies and it has been giving me lots of strength! It is currently 10:02PM and I have not smoked! Even when I was craving it. All of you are truly amazing, I am not the only one going through this hard and long journey. I want you guys to use this post too for yourselves, please come back to it like I am whenever I am feeling a craving or just down. I got really good advice from a comment here. 
Take it 30 minutes at a time, then the next 30, and so on!
My PMs will be open, feel free to message me and i'll reply when I can!"
"The worst thing about having a problem with weed is that literally noone understands it. I've been to two different therapists lately and have mentioned being a marijuana addict. One of them just looked at me blankly and one of them literally said something along the lines of ""well maybe you could just cut back.""

I have a friend for 15 years and he still doesn't get it.

I guess this is how things used to be, and still probably is to a degree, for alcoholics. No one would believe them or tell them they need more willpower or whatever.

I remember posting on imgur a long time ago that I was addicted to marijuana and I literally had fifteen responses that just said ""no you're not."" ""It's not even addicting dude!"" Blah blah blah.

I went to NA recently and feel out of place. never can figure out that chapelle bit ""boo this man!""

Anyway. I'm glad this place exists. Because it's an annoying problem. Like, I'm sure cocaine and heroin are worse addictions, I get it. But if I said ""I'm a cocaine addict trying to stay clean"" that would be fine. people would get that. With weed it's just like no one in the world understands it as a problem."
"Today I've reached 700 days sober. Back with another accountability post to mark 23 months sober today, I wish I had some insight to give you but to be completely honest I don't remember much about how to keep yourself busy and away from weed. Just one more month until I reach my ultimate goal of 24 months, but my heart goes out to the people who are struck by boredom because of this pandemic, I'd imagine that this would be one of the hardest times to quit."
"Yesterday was so hard but you guys kept me strong. I decided to manage my thoughts and share them with you. I advice everyone to do this, it helped me. "
"Why Marijuana Addiction is Bad Imagine you find yourself living in the jungle, in a strange dome like environment, like you're in the Hunger Games. You don't quite know where you are, or what you're supposed to do, but you are human, so you know you must survive. 

In the distance, a lion approaches. He growls and appears fierce and angry, but he is small enough that you feel you may be able to defeat him. The lion begins sprinting towards you, and you begin sprinting towards it. When you are just feet away from one another, both of you in the air, about to attack one another, a mysterious harness yanks you from the scene of action and away from danger. You're flying, in the clouds, by a string. It's nice and cool, and you are at peace. There is no danger here. You have been saved.

Hours later, you are released, and find yourself on the ground. There is no lion any more, and you are relieved that the mysterious powers have saved you from having to fight the lion.

But a few days later, the lion returns, hungry as usual, and you prepare for combat. You begin to run towards each other, and right as you are about to collide with one another, you are pulled up into the air once again, away from danger.

Time and time again, you are saved from having to fight the lion. Over time, the harness begins to pull you up even before you start sprinting towards the animal. You begin to run less, your fight-or-flight instinct begins to activate less. Due to lack of activity, the muscles in your calves and thighs begin to shrink, realizing they don't need to be so big anymore. 

For five years, you are supported by this magical harness, and are freed from the burden of ever having to fight the lion. But while you lingered in the clouds, light-headed and away from danger and physical work, the lion has gotten bigger, stronger, and hungrier. 

One day, the lion returns, monstrous in size and hunger. He begins to run towards you, but you do not flee, nor do you panic. Because the harness will save you. 

But on this day, the harness does not come.

And you realize, you never learned how to fight the lion."
"Sober for 9 months, I can’t describe the happiness I’m feeling I can’t even get myself to remember those days of numbness and stupidity, it’s way too painful to look back and get reminded of that misery. How could I just lock myself in a room and just be “numb”... These 9 months have provided me so much insight for why I felt the way I felt and I came to the conclusion that weed is not a solution to my problems at all. I’m working to improve my physical and mental health everyday and I have never felt stronger, even though I feel like shit at times. Sobriety is the best. Stay strong, people and don’t ever look back."
A wallet-sized inspiration 
"I haven't smoked weed this entire decade! (Day 31) I am so proud of myself and so happy that I followed through on my decision to finally, FINALLY quit after 20+ years tethered to this nasty, soul-killing habit. I have felt happier and more free these last 31 days than I have in years.  Even when I have a bad day - and I've had several this month - there's nothing that's worth jeopardizing how good I feel. 

Thank you, leavers, for being here - this community is amazing and I never would have made it through this first month without you!  Let's keep going."
"I was always ""the stoner friend""/2 months sober Whenever I went to parties I would have weed on me and would share it around.
I had people message me and say ""I caught the smell of a joint today and it reminded me of you, so I thought I'd check in since we haven't spoken for a while.

Someone came up with video game character sprites for my old friend group and I was the one holding a joint.
With those dumb Facebook games of ""what would you include in a summoning circle to summon me?"" It was always weed and rolling supplies. 
I had no personality beyond being high.

I'm 2 months sober today and I've been trying to find my personality.
I am a good cook, a bookworm, dog lover and nature enthusiast. 
I enjoy management games and circus skills, (contact staff, poi and the likes) I am in a D&D campaign and am planning on going larping.
Before the pandemic started I started going to a weekly LGBT club and a juggling club. I was also working up the courage to go to a poetry open mic night. I'm learning French.

I don't want to be ""the stoner"" anymore. I don't want people to expect me to turn up places and get high. I want to be more interesting than that. I want to reclaim the hobbies I lost due to lack of motivation and find more in the process."
"Smoked a joint on day 53 and I feel terrible Made it more than 7 weeks without a puff.
The clarity led me to realize I have to leave my partner now. I've been unhappy a long time and trying to cover my misery in a haze of marijuana. We've lived together several years and the splitting is a little complicated. I'm trying to get all my ducks in a row before I announce my decision and go, might be another week or two.
In the meantime the stress and anxiety is hard to bear, while pretending everything is fine.
So I thought 1 little joint yesterday afternoon would be okay to help me through. 
It didn't help, just amplified the anxiety. I still plan to go but am doubting other decisions I've already made about where, when and how to go. I puked 3 times this morning. I feel so overwhelmed.
I threw out the remaining joints I had been keeping in the fridge for some reason.
Wish me luck guys, I need it."
I’m so proud of myself that I reached a 500 days milestone exactly on my 30th birthday I didn’t plan this at all but apparently I smoked my last joint exactly 500 days before turning 30. Double celebration time!
"Today I said no thank you to weed That’s it that’s the whole post. Someone offered me a very nice looking blunt and my whole life raced through my head in about 6 seconds before I very nicely said 

“no thank u I am trying to quit”

😎"
"smoked an ounce a week for the past 2 years straight. 2 weeks sober!! about 2 weeks out and holy shit. i used to use weed as a stress reliever and quickly became addicted because i’m constantly stressed. got to the point of smoking 10+ joints per day, an ounce per week. 

the irony is i’m realizing now weed was also making me insanely depressed, anxious, and paranoid this entire time. i thought those things were part of my identity and weed was helping me. it’s so fucked up the way it warps your perception of yourself and your life. 

2 weeks out i am calm. i am not shaking and sweating and crippled with anxiety. the state of the world is incredibly stressful and yet... i am coping better than i was when i was high. 

also started eating healthy and exercising, i’ve probably lost 10 LBs in that time. i feel amazing. 

i convinced myself marijuana was the only thing keeping me sane. turns out it was the only thing actually making me feel crazy !!"
"I wish I knew how risky substance abuse was. I didn't even see weed as a substance. It lowered my inhibitions and I really had no perception of the consequences of my actions. It really clouded my judgement. Acting on impulses can lead to ill thought life choices, and potentially dangerous decisions "
"Advice from Recovered My future sister-in-law is a recovered opioid addict. She shared a sentiment that really stuck with me, and food for thought for anyone thinking they can just have one joint. 

“The first time you pick it back up, it’s a choice. But after that, the addiction is in control” 

So many times have I gotten sober enough that my mind starts to clear and I think to myself that I can just smoke with friends or I will only do it once. It’s never just once and it’s always back to a daily habit after that. 

I feel like I owe it to myself to see where I can go when I don’t have weed holding me back. 

So here’s to the day, we make the right choice, and everyday after that. 

It’s never worth it, even though it might feel good in the moment. Love to all struggling."
"To all the fellas out there, you’ll be surprised how hard your erections can get once you stop smoking pot. Just sayin "
"“If it makes you happy, it can’t be that bad. If it makes you happy, then why the hell are you so sad?” Weed works. . .until it doesn’t. We don’t need it. . .until we do. . .and once we do. . .it sucks big time. 
Clean day 26 after 26 years of smoking. I’m never going back to that life! EVER!!! You can quit too, if you really want to...............❤️👊💪"
Saw this on my daily walk and it made me laugh. High life was a bit of a one way street for me. No change. No progress. Just years of the same old thing. Glad I’m two months off that road now! 
"Ever since I started smoking I stopped reading I started smoking regularly in 2018, which quickly turned into a near-daily habit. It was so exciting at the time and every activity on weed felt so fun and novel. It felt like a miracle drug, it eased my social anxiety and helped me be more relaxed and talkative. I was so happy to just get home from work in the evening, put on a chill video game or movie, and spark up.

Fast forward two years, I feel this has had some really bad effects on my life. While I haven't been a constant daily smoker, it's been enough to really shape my life in ways I don't like. One of the things I really miss is reading. Before I started smoking, I was an avid reader and would devour books about philosophy, history, and politics, as well as plenty of fiction. While I still read some on my own time (and still read for university), the time I spend there has drastically gone down and I feel so much dumber for it. Not only could I not read with all the time I was wasting just getting high and playing video games, but I also feel like my memory went to shit and any reading I actually did, I had god-awful retention of anything that I learned. This is not to mention how lazy I've gotten with homework and studying. While I still have good grades, I've just been doing the bare minimum and have lost the pleasure I had for my classes before.

Another area of my life that has been really affected by my smoking has been my social life. I've always struggled with maintaining an active social life as I have pretty bad social anxiety at times. While I mistakenly wanted to believe that weed was helping me in this respect, it was really making things worse. Weed made it so much easier for me to just bail on social events that I dreaded as well as stuff with friends so I could instead stay home, light up, and have a great time just chilling by myself. On top of this, I think it's helped make me a really boring person. Especially for the first year of smoking, I didn't *do* anything, really. Just spent so much time on my own getting high that I didn't really have anything to talk about to my friends. I think it's also increased my social anxiety and made me more self-conscious when I'm around other people. And now it's gotten to the point where I'll often start to just think about how much I'm fucking up whenever I smoke. It's gotten really unpleasant.

I'm in my final semester of my Bachelor's and I want to get my shit together. I'm applying for grad programs and I don't want to half-ass that like I've been half-assing my last two years of my current degree. I know I'm a really capable guy when I try and I'm tired of just checking out to chase a high that doesn't even feel good anymore. I want to really work on improving my social anxiety and getting back into the hobbies I left behind for smoking (like reading and making music).

None of these comments about weed are a condemnation of the plant. I had some really good times with it and want to maybe enjoy it in a more reserved and measured way later in my life. I think in a social setting, it's nice to hang with some friends and chill with a joint. But for now I think I need to take a year or so off and see how my life changes. I feel like I'm really out of touch with my sober self and want to work on life.

TL;DR: Smoking daily has led me to stop reading and trying in life (academically and professionally). Also really negatively affected my social life and turned me into a hermit. I need some good distance and time from the drug for a while to get perspective and change some things in my life.

Thanks for reading if you stuck through. Hope maybe someone can relate to this and that it perhaps helps strengthen their resolve to improve their life."
"Don't put so much weight into a sover streak. Obviously don't relapse, but I'm tired of people shitting on themselves.

I'm tired if the ""I was sober for 6 months then I took one hit and now I'm such a loser.""

So you're telling me it's reasonable for you to have an expectation of perfection when dealing with addiction?

You're telling me you dont think of it as 179/180 days clean?  How is that not a win when dealing with addiction.

Stop restarting the clock on yourselves when you falter once.

Sure if you start using again for a week, then I can understand restarting the clock. But these ""I took one hit and threw ""x"" months down the drain is childish.  

You're better than that.

Edit: watching the discussion and positive comments has been the highlight of my day.  I'm glad we shared with each other.

Edit 2:  my goodness, these responses are absolutely amazing."
"7 Years THC Free - just checking in Today is my THC Free anniversary and I""m trying to make it a personal tradition to revisit this subreddit each year and do a little update. When I was in early recovery it really helped me to hear from folks who had a bit more time so I'm just trying to pass that along. It's also a chance for me to celebrate and recognize something that I honestly just don't think about in my daily life anymore!

You can see my previous posts for more detailed backstory:

[6 Years](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bz18a1/today_i_am_6_years_free_from_cannabis_addiction/)

[6 Months](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1t4pmh/6_months_detailed_story_ama/)

I've done so much over the past 7 years that I could not have done if I was still high all the time, or if I had killed myself. We are living through a time of such immense stress right now, on a global level, and I feel like I am returning more than ever to the skills I developed in early recovery. Last year I posted a timeline so here just two significant things that have happened since then. 

1. My spouse and I opened a small business 8 months ago. Obviously this is a really challenging time to be a small business owner but we are getting through it one day at a time - something I learned to do early in my recovery. 

2. Something I haven't mentioned in past posts is my physical pain, which has worsened a lot in the past year. I have had chronic migraine for a few years and this year I also got a fibromyalgia diagnosis because of my constant chronic body pain. It is challenging to engage with the online support communities for these conditions because a lot of people recommend medical marijuana which obviously isn't an option for me. I also wonder if my drug use was somewhat keeping these symptoms at bay when I was still smoking.

To anyone who is starting their recovery right now - you are doing a great job & I am proud of you! To the mods - it is so wonderful to come back to this sub and see how the community has grown, y'all are amazing. 

I don't know if I'll have the energy to answer too many questions today but I'll try to check this account over the coming week or so as I am able."
"One year sober today! After years of heavy smoking, on this day last year I had my last bowl and said goodbye to an addiction that had a strong grip on my life, friendships, finances and everything I thought I was. Sobriety forced me to re-evaluate how I dealt with my emotions, daily routines and really actually learn who I am. I am healthier, happier, far more successful. I have hobbies and much more meaningful friendships than just seshing up together to smoke all of our money, and for me it was the best decision I’ve ever made. The first year has been filled with some really fucking hard moments but a lot more satisfying ones, and I’m so excited to hit every other year after this.

I am fucking stoked! Much love to all here, I can’t wait to celebrate everyone else’s sobriety goals with them. You all rock"
"Deadlifting is the greatest cure for marijuana addiction. It gives you a natural high to replace the hole left behind by weed and eases withdrawal symptoms significantly. If you are a chronic smoker struggling to quit weed, I want you to try deadlifting or any other powerlifting movement of your choice. While powerlifting has many benefits I want you to ignore all of the ones you typically associate with weightlifting and use it solely as a tool for breaking marijuana addiction for three reasons.

1. Deadlifting will give you a massive adrenaline/endorphin high that will replace the marijuana high with one that makes you feel better and most importantly you still had to work for. This also has a large number of psychological effects that will help your brain heal from constant substance abuse.
2. Deadlifting will increase your appetite massively and will make you have a good relationship with food.
3. Most importantly, deadlifting is an amazing sleeping aid. It is more effective for sleep than melatonin and even weed. You will sleep early and you will sleep sounder. Good sleep is necessary in so many ways to combat weed addiction and weed withdrawals.

Finally, I just want to say that I hope everyone that is struggling with marijuana can find a way to get sober. I am rooting for you all and I know how difficult it can be. Please comment with any questions or concerns.

Edit: If you are going to deadlift, please do a good amount of research on how they are performed correctly and start slow. Do not try to hit your personal best immediately. Depending on your fitness level you may need to gain a certain level of flexibility in order to do them correctly. I don't think you should be performing deadlifts unless you can touch your toes. Please be careful when doing any exercise and always be mindful of warming up and pushing yourself safely."
"Advice from a former stoner, and reassurance that you too can quit just like me! To start this post off I want to say that for 4 years I probably smoked on average 4-5 Grams a day, sometimes getting so stoned I kind of just witnessed the world go by each day like a television with a sitcom on in the background. I would stuff my face with large quantities of food after every session as it was my favorite thing to do, and I will say the taste of food once the munchies hit might be the one thing I miss the most, then once I got home porn and masturbation were a necessity, and lastly video games until I fell asleep. Does this sound similar to your every day or your life? If it is you’re living in absolute hell and you’re not even living, you’re just existing. Good news is that if you’re on this sub you’ve already had the groundbreaking realization that getting high all the time might be harmful to you, maybe not physically but it damn sure does keep you from living life. Withdrawals are hell, you probably won’t be able to eat and you probably won’t be able to sleep, night terrors were a thing or me, especially when dreams came back very vividly. The BEST advice I have for this is melatonin really helped me in terms of getting proper rest through the first week or so. 

What I can tell you for sure though is I’ve been marijuana free for a whole year now, and yes the mental clarity comes back, and yes enjoying the little things come back, and yes life is absolutely beautiful and fun, and god I laugh at things now I would have never taken notice of in my hazy days. I’ve formed many great relationships over the past year, namely being my Girlfriend of 7 months who I never ever would have had the courage to talk to without the mental clarity of being clean, I’ve started college this summer and currently in pursuit of my bachelors degree along with transferring to a large university this coming spring. I feel smarter than ever, the wit I had as a young high schooler is back and it’s sharp as a tack. Meanwhile all my friends who are still getting stoned are doing the exact SAME thing and in the exact SAME place they were a year ago and many of them have excommunicated me, or just simply don’t talk to me anymore, minus a few. This is okay with me because it wasn’t by ill will on my part. 

The best possible piece of advice I can give and this covers almost any basis, in this life you’re given an amount of energy each day, and what you spend it on each day is what your life will manifest itself into, put it into relationships, your job, your education, and maybe even pursuing a spiritual path. Don’t waste your energy, put it into things that will grow and give back to you, learn to love yourself and life again not a plant that’s holding you back. I wish all of you the best of luck and I know it’s hard, but it’s attainable and life on the other side is wonderful!"
"I am not bored because I’m not high, I’m bored because boredom is a completely natural feeling. My off days seem to be the thing that gets me the most, like today. Currently bored out of my mind. But hey, before I smoked weed every day I remember being bored sometimes too. 

People who don’t smoke weed have times of boredom, and they don’t fulfill that boredom by altering their minds with drugs. They find meaningful things to do, like going to the gym, which I need to do today."
"was sober 5 months last year, relapsed for 4 when coronavirus hit, back to sober 26 days now and feeling great! To anyone else out there struggling- you got this! I'm happy to say that the time's I'm using are getting shorter and shorter compared to the times I'm sober.

I went 5 months from the end of September  to February. I'd started to use only a few times and then coronavirus hit and it quickly spiraled into everyday. At first I was okay with it. I felt success in having figured out the root of why I am addicted to weed through counselling during my 5 months of sobriety.

Basically I'd figured out that due to the neglect I experienced as a child from having an alcoholic parent, I grew up really fast in order to survive. I became a little adult child who didn't know how to have fun anymore. When I actually grew up, smoking weed was my way of allowing my inner child to come out and have fun. However, as I'm sure most of you know, smoking weed is not a sustainable approach to meeting needs. So my challenge has been to learn how to have fun in healthy ways. Not a bad problem to have in the grand scheme of things! :)

So back to trying to get through this pandemic like everyone else and I'm back to smoking weed everyday again. I tell myself it helps me focus better on doing my work from home. It's fine for awhile until August rolls around and I have a few traumatic things come up in my relationships. Things really spiraled down then and I began smoking all the time just to feel alive. It sucked, big time! Being in a haze where you don't even feel like it's a choice anymore. Bleh. It's not even fun at that point.... just depressing.

Enough was enough, after 4 months of being back at it, it was time to quit again! This time for good. So I did in early August and have been clean for 26 days. In the first week I felt really good. No problems! Then week two I was having issues sleeping and feeling stressed out. Week 3/4 I started to feel physically depressed, no energy and I just wanted to eat all the time. It started to turn into mental and emotional depression as well. I couldn't focus and felt like I wasn't getting anything done. My sense of self worth really started to drop.

Thankfully things have started to turn around week 5 and wow am I feeling so relieved! I've gotten so much work done this week and can actually focus on what I want to do. I feel calm and centered with a relatively positive outlook on life. My lungs still feel a bit weird but I'm sure that will take time to get better. 

So really I just want to say to anyone who's reading, you've got this! Sometimes it feels really hard and you might relapse or you might have intense cravings. But I promise you it's worth it! For the past two weeks I was really starting to question whether or not I would need weed for the rest of my life just to feel good. Now I can say for sure that this is not true! Things will ebb and flow, but I can promise that in the long run you will feel better not being addicted to weed. 

Peace"
"Smoked again after a two month break and it was the best decision ever: it made me realise why I quit in the first place. After two months of being alcohol, weed, sugar and caffeine free - I decided to smoke a few puffs at my best friend’s birthday, thinking I’m over the hump and won’t want to go back to smoking on a regular basis anymore. This turned out to be true, I have no intention of brining weed back into my life and here’s why:

1) Smoking made me antisocial and ended up falling asleep on the sofa  during the party
2) It made me slow and lazy again in the last few days
3) Intense dreams and insomnia are back
4) My anxiety is back - not as intense before, but annoying enough. 
5) My stomach is almost as upset as it was the first week into quitting after smoking every day
6) I’ve been working really hard on my mental health and now my feelings are a bit numb again

To sum it up, I’m almost back to where I started in terms of physical symptoms, but I have no regrets. Now I know that even a small slip can set you back massively and not worth throwing away all the hard work and progress for a little high and not being the only sober person in a social situation. 

If you’re having a weak moment, stay strong. Or if you happen to slip just be forgiving with yourself and take it as a reminder of why you made the decision to quit originally and bounce back to your healthy life straight away. 

Thanks for reading and good luck with your journey! ❤️"
Personal best...thank you all for so much support 
"31 days sober after smoking for 5 consecutive years! Let's continue doing this!!!!! I am thinking though to smoke a joint when I reach 2 months sober(15-07-20). I want to be able to like smoke once or twice per 1/2 month(s). But I am afraid that I will relapse, and before I know it, I will be smoking again every day.. What are your opinions on this? Should do it or not? And: has anyone stopped from daily chronic use but been able to smoke occasionally like once a month or even less frequently? And if you managed.. how did you keep it under control? Because to be honest, I don't want to never smoke again in my entire life. It is just way to nice."
Let’s hit another one. 
"Officially 30 days today!!!!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😭😭😭😭😭

Holy crap!!!!!!! I look back and cant believe this journey has been 30 days already. It's funny how it seems like only 2 weeks ago that I quit, but in reality, it is now double that.

I remember the night before I quit and the realization I had that it was all a facade. I remember feeling like life would be so boring without weed. And then realizing it seems boring because I never get around to doing what I plan because I get too caught up in wanting to feel high.

Being high is over rated, and I now cringe at my pothead friends who react so negatively and aggressively when I mention how I'm glad I quit. ""Fuck quitting"" is usually the casual response I get in return. I mean, I get it, I've been there too. I know I've said it to others before in the past and man, do I feel foolish about that now.

30 days in.... wow. For those who dont know, I pretty much quit cold Turkey. I tried to do a fade out, but it kept extending. So when I ran out on the morning of August 14th, i told myself that was it. No more. My original plan was to quit after school ended on August 21st, and it wasnt even a few mins later when my mind went- why not quit later? After all, the pandemic is going on anyway and I wont get my degree in the mail for a few months so I cant apply anyway.

I'm glad I didnt listen to that stoner mentality in my head.

I'm glad I didnt listen because I ended up getting cleared for graduation earlier than expected and now my degree is in the mail and on it's way 

I'm glad I didnt listen because I found out a job I wanted was hiring. It was my dream job. And I was offered the position. I am accepting it.

I'm glad I didnt listen because I can only make so much off of unemployment. And I deserve more. 

I'm glad I didnt listen because now I'm 30 days sober and realize how fucking dumb weed is. 

For those of you who are on day 1, or are starting tomorrow...you'll be glad you didnt listen either. It will be worth it. I promise. So much good will happen. The universe will bless you. It will thank you. You will become your biggest fan."
"Officially one year weed free I'll put it simply. It's been the best year of my life. I feel free, I can think, I can truly live my life. You can all do it, you all helped me do it."
"Hi everyone, I have been sober for 3.5 years and I'm writing a paper to my old self in an effort to never forget why I can never do drugs again. Is anyone interested in reading it? And also if you need advice let me know.

"A healthy person changes their behavior to match their goals, an addict changes their goals to match their behavior. Don’t get hung up on the word addict. Call it dependent, struggling, constant user, etc. The point is you know when pot is not serving your true purpose. You have to surrender to who you are. You’re perfect, with all your imperfections. LOVE YOURSELF. Practice love, practice what is good, and above all be kind to yourself. You can’t help others without helping yourself first. I love this community. I’ve been through hell in my 101 days sober, still am struggling hard, but I know that it’s worth it. If I go back and add to the 22 years of smoking I’ve already done, I’ll return to spiritual suicide. Yet some days I want to. It’s my shadow, it’s my Gollum, it’s the Venom suit, it’s the void. Is the pain worth it? Yes. I can tell myself no, it’s not, but the virtuous and  purpose driven man inside knows it is. I will not trade my innate glory for a half baked life. Thank you Leaves community, you all are worth it. Good night."
"Goodbye weed! It was a good ride but I’m moving on with my life now. 😁   I’m usually just a lurker but I thought sharing my experience might help someone else so here I am. I smoked daily for the good part of two years, and it was great I was able to unwind and relax at the end of the day and drift off to a peaceful sleep. 

  The problems started when I had to stay home for the majority of the time due to COVID (student on summer break). During this time, I was going to be staying with my parents who aren’t very drug friendly so I was planning on quitting but after a couple weeks of being sober, I was looking for a fix again. I couldn’t smoke anymore since I was now living with my conservative family and it would be too obvious. I was looking for ways I could get high and I saw that edibles would be a discreet way I could. One thing led to another and I was now hiding edibles in my room and starting my day off by getting high. So the days went by like this, with me stoned in my room watching movies and playing video games and laying in bed all day. 

  Then things got even worse. I was a porn addict but I managed to get it under control by replacing it with a good habit of working out and even managed to start dating a bit which was the main part of my life that the porn addiction was affecting. Flash forward back to the beginning of quarantine, I was spending my days high as a kite and as many of you might have experienced it quickly gets boring and you have to do more and more to get that dopamine rush. This was the perfect storm for my porn addiction to come roaring back and now I was getting high and watching porn multiple times a day. The months went on like this in a blur, and one day I saw the date and I couldn’t believe that it had been almost 4 months. I was consuming an ungodly amount of edibles and spending hundreds of dollars a month. I barely spoke to any of my friends during this time and often ignored their attempts to reach out since I was too busy getting high. 

  I realized that this had to stop and this wasn’t the person I wanted to be, and started searching for help online on how to get my life back on track. This subreddit was a great help, I saw the stories of so many people who took back control of their lives from weed and decided that enough was enough. It’s now been 4 days that I’ve been sober and today I even went out and went for a jog around the neighborhood. My biggest challenge has been that I haven’t been able to fall asleep, I’ve been sleeping 3-4 hours a day on average. (If anyone has dealt with this, please tell me what worked for you). I’m still going strong though, and I know I can keep going with all the support this community provides. To anyone else dealing with similar problems, I hope my story helps you on your journey of staying sober. I’m here along with the rest of this subreddit to support you. Thank you r/leaves for all your help."
"Just hit 2 years. Here's 4 things that got me here. I hit my two-year weed-free anniversary a few minutes ago. Along the way, I endured the death of my dad, my dog, my kid getting expelled, another with serious depression, a custody battle with my estranged wife, being totally broke, and friends telling me weed isn't addictive and PAWS doesn't exist.

 I think most advice is useless, but offer mine now as a way of showing gratitude to the universe...as a matter of fact that's the first one:

1)  Develop the habit and attitude of gratitude, which lifts your mood, offers inner prace, and attracts all the positive things in life.

2) Exercise every day you can. Many of us are anxious to begin with, and it can be difficult to meditate, but you can sweat out much of the nervous energy that led you to weed.

3) Be stubborn about avoiding weed. Some days, I can't even remember why I quit, but I just say no anyway. Being stubborn is generally a negative behavior, but when it comes to weed, sometimes you don't need to think, just refuse to turn back the clock and go back to day 1 of quitting, because just one puff and you WILL remember why you quit.

4) Rise above it. No matter what life throws at you,   you don't need to react, or argue, or get down into the negative weeds. Stop fighting life, you have only so much control, give up, accept, and do what it takes to get past it and move on."
"I just hit my 2 year anniversary (please read if you're having a hard time) Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

Id just like to celebrate with this sub. I have not been posting since my first 2 months. But god damn this sub was so helpful for me. I used to write here almost every day. And it helped me a lot. For those of you who still struggle or to those of you who just hit your first 24 hours. TALK! Please talk to people, talk to them about your feelings. Its okay, the first few days/ weeks are such an emotional rollercoaster. 

&#x200B;

Its okay to cry, its okay to not know what to do anymore, its okay to completely breakdown.. The days are long the nights are even longer. No matter how cliche this sounds. But it will get easier. Reach out! look for a proffesional to help you.

&#x200B;

I had a supportive family, i had therapy for 2 times a week. And all my friends supported me (eventhough a lot of them kept smoking) 

&#x200B;

Its such a great life, it gets better. When i started this journey. I lived with my parents, i was unemployed, looking for the purpose in life. Now 2 years later; I got a house, i got a girlfriend, i got 2 cats, im studying healthcare (to help people fight against their addiction). Things will get easier.. i cant sweat it enough.. Just hang in there..

&#x200B;

Once again thank you for listening.

(sorry for bad grammar im not a native english speaker)

Thanks for the awards heroes!!"
"Anyone else having a hard time staying sober during this pandemic? I’m trapped in my apartment for possibly months all alone with little to do. Sure, I can keep binging movies, playing chess, piano, taking baths, etc, and that stuff is awesome, but I keep considering that maybe this just wasn’t the time to turn a sober leaf. 

Anyone else finding it particularly challenging to stay sober while stuck in their apartment with nothing to do?"
"If you think weed helps you function, keep this in mind Just a reminder for those who are struggling to quit/stay sober, particularly those who think weed might be beneficial to their functioning. 

When weed is in your life, you may notice better moods, more motivation, and overall better functioning than when you are sober.

It's important to remember, however, that this doesn't necessarily mean weed is helping you. You might just be dependent on it, meaning you function worse without it, which is objectively NOT helping you. Functioning without any outside help is so freeing, and is so much more real than with pot.

Give sobriety a try for a few months, and when everything is sort of reset, you might be surprised how low your quality of life was without even truly  noticing."
"Smoking weed to suppress your emotions is like paying for a credit card with a credit card. I'm realizing this now. By medicating emotions with weed you're only digging yourself deeper and you're going to have to do that much more work eventually to dig yourself out of the hole.

I have found prayer and meditation to be helpful to me in moving myself in the right direction."
"One year sober today, no joke. Edit: thanks for the gold and all the kind words!"
"6 months no cannabis I hit the six month mark a couple days ago.  I feel great.  Ambition, mental clarity returned.  A different life really.  Glad to be here."
"Weed ruined my dental hygiene habits As gross as it sounds, one of the things that weed really screws up in my life is dental hygiene. 

I have one of those electric toothbrushes that syncs up with your phone recording how often you brushed your teeth and I just saw this correlation between me starting to go harder on the smoking and the decline in how often I brush my teeth. 

I didn't realize this because you know how it is when weed starts taking over your life, you decide to skip on certain things for a few days and before you know it, it becomes a habit.

I'm done with that. We are all lazy and weed is an enabler of that and I'm done arguing with people that keep lying to themselves about how weed is not affecting their lifestyle. It's not that I'm going around people telling them to stop smoking but quite the opposite, it's people disagreeing with my choices because it makes them question their own.

It's interesting, I don't know anyone that has abused substances as much as I have and yet I see things that they don't and never get defensive like that.

Stay strong and don't get discouraged by people that don't know what they are talking about!"
"556 days weed free after 20 years of daily smoking! You can do it, too! A small motivational post! Thanks to this community I achieved this mark today on my birthday!! You can do it, too!"
"One week sober and I wanted to celebrate...by smoking Ass-backwards I know. I guess this is how the addict brain works. Now that I’ve made it through the worst withdrawals and “proved” to myself I can be sober, my dumbass started thinking maybe I could smoke since it’s the weekend. One hit couldn’t hurt, right? Wrong! 

How long before the weekend turns into just at night? And how long before just at night turns into all day? Given my history, it probably wouldn’t take long before I once again turned into an all day everyday self-loathing stoner. Fuck that! I’m not going to fall for that shit. 

Just had to get this internal struggle off my chest. Felt like I had to write this out as a response to my addict brain that keeps trying to tempt me. If anyone else feels like telling my addict brain to fuck off, please feel free to do so. 

Couldn’t have made it this far without this community’s support. Love and strength to you all."
"I have about 100 quid left for the month - I could spend 50 on cheap food and 50 on some more weed - I chose to make a mealplan for the next 2 weeks and spend all of it on food, and I am feeling awesome! "
"one week sober. holy shit Today marks one week sober from weed. Ive never been more proud of myself in my entire life. If you told me I was going to go sober 5 months ago I wouldve laughed in your face, and now look where I am. I always had the mentality that weed controls my life and thats that. Now, I realize that it doesn’t, and I can be happy sober. Im still struggling with my emotions, sleep, and nausea- but I’m slowly doing better every day. I’m so fucking proud of myself."
"I haven't smoked pot since may 20. My friend in high school told me that after 3 months your brain feels normal again. It stuck with me and I've been chasing that 3 month for years and I'm so happy to finally be there. He is right I felt that big difference at 3 months but I continue to feel better every week.

Edit: April 20, not may.

Edit 2: Happy if I could inspire some people. Anyways, I'm moving on frrom gaming and this social media thing. I'm moving on to other things. I will soon be a paramedic, I'll be helping broken souls or people fighting for their lives. I hope I don't see any of you soon."
"4 months completely sober today No weed no alcohol for 4 months today! This by far the longest sober streak I've had since I was 12 years old, and I am 54 now.  That's kind of shocking to write down.  

My like isn't paradise, it's largely the same.  The difference is that I am present for everything and I have been brave enough to face all of my challenges without intoxicating myself to cope.  

I credit therapy, a focus on radical acceptance, and mindfulness. I am learning to accept and appreciate all experiences, good and bad.  It's not easy, but it has given me so much self esteem that I've lacked.  I can do this and I don't need weed to feel good when I'm unhappy or to enhance experiences. I love the freedom of not needing to constantly think about my next high. 

 Other things I like- no brain fog, better memory and better energy, I wake up easier in the morning, I am more relaxed and less anxious, and I'm more in touch with my true feelings now.  Before I didn't know what I was feeling most of the time. I was so anxious until I got high again.  Then the anxiety cycle repeated time after time, day after day.  Yuck.

I like this new me so much better, I think I am on my way to a better life.  This sub has been a great help to me.   I will keep coming back to remind me what early sobriety is like and try and help others however I can. For those thinking about giving up weed, I can honestly say it is a great move and the short term withdrawal is very much worth it!  I also want to encourage those that try to stop and relapse, it's ok, it's taken me many many tries.  Don't get down on yourself, it's a process, just keep trying. Persistence is key- this drug is stubborn!

Edit: changed the last couple sentences to be more encouraging! 💪❤"
"Having a clearer mind has let me see the damage I've done This isn't going to be the usual 'my life is so much better since I quit' type of post, but more a 'shit, reality has smacked me in the chops, what the fuck have I done' type of post.

I decided to quit just after the new year, it's been over 4 months now. My head is so much clearer, I can focus better and my memory is getting better. But this has had a downside, because now I see the damage I've caused to not just my own life, but the others around me.

I'm about to turn 41, I've alienated myself from all the people I once had in my life. I've lost my partner, who was the best thing to have ever happened to me, through inaction and being lazy, inconsiderate and completely selfish. Because of this I no longer get to live with my beautifully incredible son which hurts every day that I have to leave him behind to go home. I've closed doors in my life that I'm not even sure I can open again. Over 20 years of this habit all I've done is create my own prison for myself, all I wanted to do was get home from work, get my son to bed and get high watching television. I neglected the most important people in my life time and time again, through the money spent and time wasted I took their right to a happy, fulfilled family and smoked it. At the same time I neglected my mental health, I spent years with crippling depression and anxiety, not even thinking that all I was doing by smoking was making it worse. I created masks for myself to hide my mental health, I hid lifelong conditions that I didn't realise I even had because being high all the time did a great job of keeping me from realising my issues. These masks I made for myself have been hard to take off, but I'm glad that I have done.

Over 4 months in and I'm never going back, I'm receiving therapy again to deal with the regret that I've left myself with, the biggest being not doing this sooner when the people around me were ringing the alarm bells as loud as they could. If I'd paid attention to the people that loved me I wouldn't have to go home at night and look at my walls, with nothing but the deafening silence of all I've lost ringing in my head, instead of the alarm bells from the people I love trying to warn me when I wasn't listening.

Despite the failures and the regrets that I've caused myself, I'm sure that I will get things back on track again. I can't quite just hit the reset button, I have to deal with what I've created, but I can try and start a new chapter for myself. Thanks for listening."
"I cry almost every day I smoked heavily from the age of 15. I'm now almost 28. 4 years ago I moved from my home country (where grass is crappy / expensive) to a new one (where grass is HQ / cheap and, more recently, legal). I moved here to be with the woman I love, a woman who, thanks to a weed-related breakdown early in our relationship, didn't want me smoking. So I quit. And I quit again. And again. But every time, I would take it back up, because I'm weak. I would smoke behind her back very frequently. I would actually *look forward* to days that she would get home from work late, or go out with her friends, because it meant I got to smoke. She never found out, but it ate away at me, and our relationship.

We broke up 3 months ago, after almost 5 years together. It was amicable, she said we both tried our best, but it just didn't work. But the truth is I didn't try my best. I never tried my best for her. Because weed was my focus, against my own will and judgement, and it tore me away from her, made me love her less. And I can never tell her that. I can never tell her that our relationship could have been *so* much more if I had just been stronger for us.

I've been off the stuff now for 8 days.This is (at least) my 15th serious attempt at quitting, and I'm determined to make it stick this time. I've thrown so much of my life away because of my need to smoke and I'm sick of it. My thoughts are getting clearer, I'm at the gym every day, but it's so damn hard. Quitting tobacco on the same day probably wasn't the best idea, but that was something I lied about as well, and I'm dedicated to leaving the old me, the disgusting liar me, in the past.

Like the title says, every day is a struggle. I can't tell if the tears are because I miss her, or just a withdrawal effect, or both. The first few months since the break-up were much easier, and I really didn't feel all that sad, so I'm inclined to think it's the latter.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I guess I'm just writing this all out for my own sake, but also to thank everyone in this group from the bottom of my heart, because whenever I feel like there's a pile of rocks on my chest and I start to consider driving to the dispensary on my way home from work, I head to r/leaves and find so much inspiration to keep me on the path. 

You guys are my heroes, we can do this together."
"It's Friday, I Ain't Got Sh*t to do or Have to go to Work Tomorrow, But I Ain't Getting High **3 months sober today**

Sun's shining, had a good day, seeing some friends tonight. Life feels much better without weed/hash.

So glad I have made it this far, looking forward to 6 months!

Good luck to everyone else and thanks for the support!"
"Weed will always be there, but you need to heal first I am making this post because this mindset helps me tremendously. If you’ve quit for a day, a week, or a month, it doesn’t matter - you didn’t quit because you dislike weed (I would imagine)... you quit because you lack self control. 

If you’re a day, or week, or month, or year in, and say, “see I can quit just fine”, then you’re still controlled by your desire for escapism. You still don’t have control. If you’re thinking about it daily, you still don’t have control. If you’re thinking “I’ve quit for long enough”, you still don’t have control

When you return to weed, it needs to be like returning to green beans, if you haven’t had them in a while. You don’t count the days since you last had green beans, you don’t care if you don’t finish your green beans and throw them away. You can have them right in front of you and be indifferent. 

Once you are truly, truly, indifferent to smoking again, then you can smoke freely. I have quit for months and not been over it then relapsed, and was quickly addicted again, because the addiction was still alive, waiting to be fed again. Only if your honest with yourself, will you know that you’re truly in a different place. I doubt I will be for years. 

I will not smoke with you today. I may tomorrow, but just not today. I am still addicted. Good thing tomorrow isn’t real. 

Weed isn’t going anywhere, and you’re not going anywhere while your still in a hole. Get out of the hole and you just may realize that weed was never the problem, it was just the solution. Fix the problem, then you can truly enjoy weed again, if you so choose at the time. 

Peace.

**Edit:**

Finally at home and can edit this. First of all, thanks for the nice response, wasn't expecting that. 

Second, I want to address a point I heard in the comments that is worth serious consideration. Instead of trying to rearticulate it, here's the comment. 

>Even after decades and thinking your in the clear and becoming indifferent an addiction could sneak up on you if you go back to using the substance you were addicted to - i guess that's where i disagree with what you said.
- /u/pierrelacroixs 

 It will always be there, and maybe we can control it, but maybe we should be thankful once we reach the ""green bean"" status, opposed to testing our luck again."
"7 months sober...and I found a weed pen in my jacket pocket Hi everyone! As I said I’m 7 months sober and my life has improved dramatically. I’ve truly never been this stable and content before. However, recently I haven’t been so good about making my sobriety a top priority compared to when I first got sober. I haven’t been going to as many meetings etc. So yesterday I go to a meeting where I talk about how I’m getting sloppy with my sobriety and need to refocus myself. I’m walking out of the meeting to the subway and I feel this hard thing in my pocket. I haven’t worn this jacket since last winter. I pull it out and it’s a weed pen (weed was my drug of choice). I was in shock. I haven’t touched a weed pen in 7 months. A devil voice in my head tells me to check and see if it’s charged. I press the button and it is. I had the thought like wow just take a puff, take a hit. I immediately called a sober friend who told me to throw it out. I went to a trash can and held it over the trash. I literally couldn’t let it go. Finally, I did. But then as I was walking into the subway station, I had a wave of regret and thought, “you should go back to the trash and get it” HOW DISGUSTING. Like first of all, I would’ve looked crazy rummaging through a trash can and second of all, that’s gross. I’ve talked about it with many friends and they’re all proud of me for throwing it out. But it was scary that it was so hard to let go of. It reminds me that we are always so close to relapsing and sobriety is so fragile. I cannot believe I was able to throw it out without taking a hit. If I can do that, anything is possible. Love this sub. Thanks for reading."
"Hard drugs destroy what you are. Weed destroys what you can be. Heroin and meth have effects that can be seen, that can be measured physically over time. That's why there's such a strong stance against them with no support.

Weed, however, has no physical or obvious effects that can be detrimental overall. It's the cognitive ability that is effected by weed. It destroys your habits, your thought processes, your judgement, your potential. The argument that weed is the best alternative to hard drugs is correct, but that doesn't mean that it is harmless. The least of all the evils is still evil. If you have the ability of moderation, then by all means go for it. But some people, a lot of people, don't. Whether they realize it or not. 

I've been battling in my head whether weed is ""really all that bad."" The fact that I even need to debate it is the key thing that drove me to quitting. I've relapsed several times, and each one I've literally gone out on my deck and paced, pondering whether or not it's such a horrible thing. When I quit, I feel good, make better decisions, learn things easier, cultivate my skills in my passions and hobbies, create better habits, my mood and overall well-being is greatly improved. 

Why do I keep debating on whether or not I should give that up for a few minutes of dopamine? Natural highs are way better, and have a much greater payoff: A good life. Not a good FEELING life. 

I can trust my judgement now, and my life is 100x better without it. I also know that moderation isn't an option for me. I can trust that too. 

Fuck you, weed. You robbed me of a year and a half of my life that could've been spent building a better one. Now's a good a time as any to start though. 

Thanks for letting me ramble. Have a good day everyone."
"My fellow new year’s leavers, stay strong, we’ve made it one week! Reclaim your time, reclaim your life, this is our year. "
"Day 25, and I think I had an epiphany about what weed did to my brain and body: my body is surviving the trauma of weed The withdrawal symptoms are horrible for sure, everything is hard, it makes you just wanna relapse. But I've come to a realization.

Weed has deleted my body's memories.

Anxiety: my body used to get cannabis to calm it down, and now my body forgot how to handle it. It's a muscle that i have to train.

Depression: my body was happy, and now it forgot how to be happy and produce the happy chemicals.

Breathing: my body forgot how to breathe, and now it realized it was going through a trauma, with a little physical activity everyday, it will get better.

Social events: my body forgot that hanging around smoking joints isn't enough for a social life, now it has to learn again to join the community.

Fulfillment: One joint and I'm satisfied and that explains why I didn't do anything with my life, my body is now craving fulfillment.

Memory: my body's brain activities were damaged, and it has to learn all over again to analyze and concentrate.

Appetite: my bodys appetite used to be induced by cannabis and now it lost it, it needs to learn to want things again.

Surviving the trauma of weed... This means now it's in physical and mental therapy... We have to learn how to do everything all over again, I know we all wanna feel normal, but we can't, we have to learn a lot of stuff all over again.

Our body needs physical therapy."
Instead of smoking I went on a hike with my dog. 
"Day 7: almost killed myself 2 days ago, now I feel fine Just wanted to encourage others who deal with suicidal ideation when quitting/in general. I have bipolar and I didn’t think I could make it, but I reached out to my support system and stayed with my mom and brother for a few days. This morning I woke up and I feel pretty normal :-) keep fighting!!!"
"Miss Mary Jane is the most seductive little trickster I’ve ever known. And I was madly in love with a pathologically lying narcissist once. But you, you were something else. 

Miss Mary Jane, you are so goddamn good. Until you aren’t. Until you drive me to the point of near psychosis. Until you make me panic so hard that I’m shaking uncontrollably. Until you make me forget every little detail of my life. Until I’m convinced you’ve damaged my mind, maybe permanently. And I still can’t get myself to even blame you. To be fair, it’s not your fault. I’m the one that’s always coming back for more. 

You were good to me once. You got me through so much. You held my hand. You were a friend when no one else was. You helped me process trauma. You inspired me to keep going. You made me laugh. You got me through the day. You were more than a friend. I was in love with you. 

But Mary, I need you to know, that it’s over for good this time. I’m at my breaking point. I tried to make our relationship fair. I tried to see you only every once in a while, but I always end up back where I started. Obsessing over you while I destroy my life and my sanity.

You and I, we’re like two magnets. Your pull is just too strong. And I always want to come back for more. So I’m cutting my losses, throwing you and everything that comes with you out of my life. Replacing you with healthy habits and self love. I’m sorry Mary. I just can’t be around you anymore. I’m choosing me this time, for good."
"2 years without weed Hey everyone,   


Just wanted to check in as it has officially been 2 years since I quit. My last time smoking was the last day of Memorial day in 2018. I was at a bachelor party in Las Vegas and used that as my ""last time I would ever smoke weed"" and I am pleased to say I have not touched it since.   


From a daily heavy smoker, to now free from weed, tobacco, vapes, etc.  


If you told me 3 years ago that I would quit, cold turkey, and not even miss smoking weed, I would tell you that you were crazy. But here I am, 2 years later, looking back and being so thankful that I made that decision.   


It wasn't easy. I quit many time before that and never was successful. But, here I am, 2 years without weed.   


It was probably the best single decision I have ever made in my life.   


If I can do it, you guys can!  


Lets do it!"
"Christmas day marked 30 days without weed, something that seemed impossible once upon a time as a 25 year smoker. Thank you all for helping me get here. Oh, and I got engaged. I'm loving these sober holidays! Keep flourishing y'all! "
"Had my last joint at 11am yesterday. It’s now almost 1pm! I’ve made it 24hrs Onwards and upwards! I have pretty bad PTSD and general anxiety, but I will persist"
"Old woman breaks old habit- Day 10! I’ll be 60 on 4-20 and it gives me great pleasure to say I will not enter my golden years chained to addiction. 

Seemed like such a huge change as I was an all day “one hit wonder” (wondering why I kept at my one hitter all day) for several years once weed got legal near me. I had too many scruples to buy from a dealer. But like alcohol-just because it was legal did not make it right for me. 

Clarity is returning. My sleep is fine and I am shedding that head down and try to hide it way of life. 

Hello pride, gratitude, relief, freedom. 

Here’s to the olds! We can do it and we are.

"I like the *idea* of smoking weed more than I actually like smoking it. So day 3 has just ended, and after having a pretty good day I fancied writing something up - just to get it all out, if nothing else.

I've realised that the idea of smoking is far more appealing than the reality of it. I can picture it in my head right now. Smoke a few bowls, play some video games, fuck around on the internet, maybe watch a film. Sounds like a good time, and in all honesty it should be, right?

But I am an addict. I can't control my weed smoking -- at all. I get up mid day, have a shower, eat something, then blaze up. I find that I can't stop clock watching. How is it only 3pm? I feel so tired and lethargic...am I even high? Or is this just a headache? I could really go for a nap right now. Why not? An hour or two later of drifting in and out of sleep leaves me in a zombie like state. Wait, did I even sleep? Or was I just sitting with my eyes closed, in a stoned daze?

Again, I find myself clock watching. I smoke in periods - mid day, then the evening, then at night before bed. So I'm clock watching, waiting for the next period of the day to start, so I can fill my bong full of ice and blaze a few bowls. See, I wouldn't need to do this if I was rich and had a huge pile of weed, but I'm not. I find myself tactically smoking to try and stretch every last gram. 

I've come to the realisation that this isn't fun. I came to that conclusion years ago, yet here I am still smoking at least a gram a day. It's just too fucking easy to let yourself continue doing it, even if you hate it. Because at the end of the day it numbs you to that hate. You stick to the idea of smoking weed, and how great it seems in your head. Yeah, can't wait to smoke this fat bowl, even though deep down I know in a couple hours I'll be sat feeling shit, wondering what the fuck it is I'm doing with my life.

I'm spending £10 a day just to pass the time, when I could be doing something constructive...for free. Fuck this, fuck weed, and fuck any urge to smoke. 

**And then it clicked.** I have this urge to smoke...but that urge stems from that idea. The idea that smoking will be fun. I've smoked enough to know that it'll be nothing like that, so the urge, in a sense, becomes moot. That urge means fucking nothing because I know getting stoned just makes me feel like shit these days. 

*The idea of smoking weed is great.* But for someone who ends up smoking all day everyday, it just isn't.

If anyone read all this shit, thanks. If you're struggling, stay strong. We got this."
"This will be the first 4/20 in 4 years that I will not smoke weed You know what I realised? I have a perfectionist problem. My body yearns to be the best, does not matter what. Mathematics? I have to be the greatest. Writing? Lookin' at Albert Camus right here. Music? Nobody knows better tracks than I do! 

I could go on and on. You know what is the problem? I was never the best at anything. As a matter of fact, I never gave it a shot. Why?

It's hard.

Anyone who ever tried to pick up a skill knows the frustration of the learning period, of the countless hours lost in picking up the basics of a craft, of learning on your mistakes. Point is, it is important to let yourself experiment and see what works. If it doesn't work the first time, it might work the 10th.

See, I do not know this feeling. Every time I tried to get involved into a hobby or skill, I would quit on the first real obstacle. Can't play this song after practicing for 20 minutes? Give up the guitar, there is no point if you're not going to be the new Jimi Hendrix.
You can't solve the math problem at hand from the first try? Must be too hard to solve, look up the solution.

Looking back, weed never made me an unmotivated perfectionist. I always had it in me, ever since elementary school. The problem is that weed made me okay with being that. It taps into this basic primal urge of constant change in a human (the kind of change which forces you to pick up a skill, to try and hook up with girls, to go out and experience nature) by shutting it down. Why be the best when you can let a person who's born to be the best fulfill their destiny? Just be average, there is no shame in that...

Except when you quit. Suddenly, you start looking around, and see all of your friends playing an instrument, drawing in their spare time, writing poetry, exploring on foot. What do you do in your spare time? Spend it on some godforsaken part of YouTube you did not even now exists. Oh look, a speedrun of a game you have no interest of ever playing? More interesting than the book at your bedside you've been planing to read for months, but never got to do it. Scrolling through social media to see new posts from people you absolutely do not give a shit about on things which could not interest you less? Better than picking up the guitar and practicing.

Looking back, I lied by saying that I wasn't the best at anything.

I am the best at avoiding living. I am the best at giving excuses. I am the best at lying to myself. 

Been sober for 17 days, and plan on staying sober for months to come. I might not be the best, but I will become the best I can be."
"2 years sober today, no joke. "
For the love of God do not start drinking after quitting It makes the withdrawal that much worse
Day 16 of not smoking. Have been smoking almost every day for the last year. I’m 18 years old so it’s sad that my relationship with weed went downhill at such a young age but I’m motivated to maintaining sober. Edit: This is my first post on reddit and I joined because I saw some of the post in this community. Its amazing all of the support people give in here. Most people in my life either don’t care or judge me. Thanks for all the support this is an amazing place.
"For those thinking they can moderate your use You might be able to do it, well shit I was able to do it. I was weed free for 75 days, then I relapsed, and thought I could moderate it. And I did, I only did it on weekends, max once per week since the New Years. Was it worth it? Hell fucking no. Every time I smoked I woke up like an airhead, and I always end up fucking hating my decision to smoke. I could be clear headed and motivated, but no, I decided to smoke. So I come back here today on my second day of quitting, and hopefully this will be the last time Ill have to “quit” again. If you want to be your true self, weed can’t be in the equation, at least for me. Thanks for reading"
"Day 365, I made it a year! Today marks 1 year without cannabis!
Thank you to this community for the love & support.

This journey hasn't been easy but it gets easier all the time.

For those interested in how I got this far I small chunked it. I started with a plan of making it 1 year, but from 0 to a year is a giant leap.
I quit 1 day at a time. Sometimes I got cravings & they usually went away by the time I woke up. Weirdly I got cravings as far as 250 days into my quit.

It feels a little surreal, I know I haven't smoked for a whole year, it used to be such a big thing for me, now I don't evenue give a shit about the stuff.

For those of you who are beggining or on this journey & struggling remember, nobody is cut from a different cloth, if I can do it you have the power in yourself to accomplish the same thing.

Working out is massive & has changed my life all on its own."
"Trust me when I say time is leaving fast. Started smoking when I was in high school, turned 27 in April and I look back and I fucking regret it so hard, it will take everything from you, when you are on your death bed do you want to look back on your life and a lot of it was smoking to cover up your problems and emotions? I have been clean for a couple of months now and I feel like the true me, the person I should have been all along. I have new life goals and I want to pursue a new career and going to go back to school. our live here is very short, spend your time wisely, achieve your goals and help others. Don't look back on your life and have it be a haze."
I hope everybody is staying positive we all are in this together we got this!! 
"It's weird to have dreams every night again. I never remembered my dreams when I was smoking, this is so crazy."
"Stop counting and start living I read this tip on here, some person in the comments said this. One guy was happy cause he reached a certain milestone, and somebody answered: stop counting and start living. 

For me personally, this has been the best advice EVER. When I first tried to stop, I gave myself milestones like a month or two months, but this justified ""trying again, cause maybe I learned to control it now"". As many of you know, that is a lie.

Anyway, with milestones, I feel like I'm forcing myself to think about the substance, and unintentionally keeping it a part of my life. But I want to GET RID OF IT. And to stop counting and start living has been the single best thing to keep in mind for me. When I ask myself now: how long has it been? I push that away and answer to myself: it doesn't matter, I'm living now.

Now this tip may not be for you, maybe setting goals with dates is simply the best approach for you. But if that has never worked, try this approach: stop counting and start living. Obviously, I know when I stopped -16 days ago, a bigger stop than I've had in years - and it's good to 'know'. But to think about it everyday has usually set me up for failure. 

I'm sorry if this mental approach doesn't help you, but it sure is helping me MOVING ON from weed."
"Two weeks without any cannabis after being a heavy daily user for 10 years The first week or so of sleepless nights sucked ass plus I barely ate anything, now I’m having 3 healthy meals a day plus falling asleep easy and getting my 7-8 hrs without it.  Feeling good

Edit:  just want to say I really appreciate all the kind words and good vibes. Never thought I’d ever be posting on this sub, but I’m very glad I am now."
"Trauma is the real gateway Things like cannabis, caffeine and alcohol are not the gateways. Things like molestation, childhood abuse, neglect and TRAUMA are the real gateways. These things manifest into addiction, hyper sexuality, violent tendencies, self harm etc. All of these things are the SYMPTOMS not the cause of a much larger issue. All of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. This is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications don't typically work. We need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from SELF.

Addiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. This behavior is then difficulty to give up. We need to realize that addiction is not a CHOICE, addiction is not an inherited disease. Addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. 

I think so many can agree, if able to put their egos aside, that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. Maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault, but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. Trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodies/minds (especially when children) cannot comprehend or process. These past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. When we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. I'm sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be, overworking, shopping, unhealthy/over eating, gambling, sex, drama, codependent relationships, etc.. We need to come together and stop judging one another. We need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause, the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. This is a sign of strength not weakness. Trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease, making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease.

TRAUMA is the real gateway."
"My life has changed beyond my expectations since quitting. I post pretty regularly because it feels great to express how good this quitting has been for me and in order to inspire you to do so as well.  
What's different:
Cleaner house. 
Better diet. 
Improved sleep. 
Better marriage. 
Calmer life overall. 
Lack of shame in myself for my addicted behavior. 
Sense of pride in beating an addiction. 
Improved memory. 
Increased compassion for people close to me who struggle with addiction. 
Better able to handle situations in public without anxiety. 
This is at 14 weeks clean. 
Good luck to all on this path."
"When we quit weed... When we quit weed, we aren't quitting the weed itself, we are quitting that 1-3 hours of escape from our daily lives, that has slowly become our life. We are quitting the warmth of the smoke/vapor in our hands and mouths, the comfort of holding something and being held in the soothing embrace of Mary Jane. We are quitting the clouding of emotions, investment, and clarity  We are quitting avoiding confrontation, complexity, and real acceptance. Too often we forget there is a reason why we start, and forget those reasons are waiting for us when we stop. 

Step one is to stop smoking.

Step two is to start living. 

Take it easy fam 😎"
"Been living with my friends who smoke but seeing how their lives revolve around weed makes me want to stay sober! In abscense of other living arrengements I moved in with my good mates, who smoke plenty of weed. Almost as much as me when I was smoking and just as compulsively. Before moving in I had my doubts, but after a week I've turned down a chance to smoke countless times already. And I don't want to smoke any more than I did three weeks ago.

In fact, seeing my mates' lives revolving around getting high makes me want to stay sober. I enjoy my life without constantly having to source the strongest pot and therefore being endlessly broke. I enjoy having a clear mind and waking up in the morning without sandpaper in my eyes and throath. I enjoy not having those anxiety loops as much as before. Living with my friends reminds me of my own habit and all the shit I put myself through because of it.

Almost half a year down and I'm really proud of myself."
"Wish I had listened. I remember the day I smoked weed for the very first time in freshman year of high school, when I was 14 years old. I was sitting in science class and my friend told me that he was about to score some weed after school and asked if I wanted to smoke some. I said Hell Yes, and we started talking about it. 

Our science teacher overheard our conversation and came up to us and said, “You are wasting your youth and you are going to waste your life with that crap.” 

We laughed at him, rolled our eyes, and made fun of him behind his back. We thought that what he said was total nonsense. 

Flash forward. I am 32 years old. Been smoking for 18 years, addicted to marijuana for 12 years. Guess what, I did waste my youth and my adult life getting high. 

Anyway, I am on Day 16 right now. I quit in the past (several times) but have always relapsed. Back here on leaves hoping to find some connection and support!"
"10 years smoking weed everyday. I'm 25 now and coming to the harsh realization it has completely ruined me. Disclaimer: this is my first post, be gentle. Telling my story in the hopes that I can move forward and begin recovering.

I've smoked weed and drank heavily since I was 15. I'm the product of two neglectful, abusive parents but despite a difficult home life, I always felt I was quite resilient as a child. I remember praising myself often for being able to smile through the pain I was enduring.

I considered my young self an overachiever and a people pleaser. I was always very outgoing, was able to manage a lot of friend groups. I was on the honor roll every year and excelled at every sport I tried.

That all changed dramatically after I tried smoking weed in high school. I LOVED the feeling of getting high. It was an escape from all the inner demons I was trying to silently battle. I very quickly became emotionally dependent. I stopped going to class, only attending to smoke weed with my friends.

To make a long story short, I did this throughout my entire high school career and ended up being expelled but I didn't really care. I became withdrawn from people, judgemental and anxious.

Between then and now, I've had surprisingly good careers and been successful in a lot of aspects despite this. But I've always had this feeling I'd break one day. I could only hide my bad habits and mental state for so long.

That break finally came when I had my first panic attack on board a plane coming home from a vacation and got violently sick. It was the first vacation I'd been on in 9 years and rather than enjoying myself, I dealt with crazy anxiety and what I would assume was withdrawal from weed. All I could think about was getting home so I could finally smoke again.

I've been paranoid and horribly sick to my stomach every day since. My anxiety has been through the roof, I wake up at 4am daily and I often think I'm going to die soon. Because of this I have been smoking 2-3 bowls every hour or so to surpress the overload I'm experiencing.

I've completely withdrawn from the world since. I've lost most of my friends, I don't have any hobbies that require leaving my house and I work from home which doesn't help. I'm even having terrible anxiety thinking about posting this..

At this point I've realized that a vast majority of shitty events in my life and bad mental habits are centered around weed and alcohol. I've since quit drinking and am now 5 weeks sober in that regard and I desperately want to quit smoking weed too.

I've just ran out of weed today and am heading to  visit with a new doctor in an hour. I'm hopeful that today is the day I can finally be strong enough to turn a new leaf.

**UPDATE**

Hey guys, I wanted to pop on here with an update and say thank you for all the kind, encouraging messages here. I don't have many friends left to talk to, so to know I have a supportive and safe place here is a really nice feeling.

The doctor prescribed me a very low dose of anti-anxiety and depression medication. I have a moderate fear of prescription medication so I'm noticing I'm a lot more on edge and hypersensitive to how my body is feeling. I also feel like I'm just replacing one numbing substance with another.

Tonight was the third day taking a half dose and the initial side effects suck. The highlight is temporary (I hope) heightened anxiety, so I have a lot of moments of panic where I can't tell if I'm breathing. Kind of weird, but everything is feeling kind of weird right now so I'm taking it day by day.

I decided against quitting cold turkey. I got through one day, but combining withdrawal symptoms with the side effects of starting this new medication was way too much to handle. I'm kicking myself for that a bit, but I know I will get there eventually. Just a little slower.

I switched from smoking a strain with 18% THC between 10-15 times a day, to a strain with less than 4% THC and 14% CBD about 5 times a day. I've been struggling to eat or keep anything down so this has helped drastically with calming my nerves enough to get some food down.

My plan is to wean myself off of this CBD gradually over the next week or so. Maybe more. I realize I'm kind of navigating this as I go now, this feels VERY different from quitting drinking.

I'm going back to my doctor in a week and a half for a check-in, so I will update then on my progress! Thank you all again for being so kind and welcoming of my story and struggles. I appreciate the openness here ♥️"
"The last nug So...I thought all my weed was gone but I was wrong. I was cleaning and just found a really nice nug that I hid away for myself a little while back. I just did what I thought I was never capable of doing and I flushed that mother down the toilet. I have never ever felt so strong before. I smelled it, touched it and kissed his sorry ass goodbye. I am so proud of me. Trust me, if I can do it you can too."
"I was so close to caving today it’s almost unbelievable But I didn’t. Don’t know how, but I didn’t. Thought about everyone commenting on my 10 day promise, and I will not let you all down! See you in 7 days"
"It's not the substance itself This happened to me today. 

I'm a full month without smoking. Today, I had to light something up and i caught the lighter. It was like meeting an old friend. The feeling of it in my hands, its weight... it just felt good. The weed didn't even took part on this sensation at all.

So it struck me. We are addicted to a substance? Yes. But the ritual itself takes a huge part on the addiction. It makes you feel you in the control (because its aways the same thing), and makes you feel you have some kind of company - the lighter, the pipe, the weed... all imaginary friends.

This mindset feels more reasonable for me. You're not fighting against an evil chemical that's imprisoning you. You fighting against habbits that you build for yourself. So all you gotta do is build another habbits. 

I know it's hard, but changing a habbit for a habbit seems more achievable than changing a chemical for a habbit, right? At least for me. Hope this insight helps you somehow. Good journey my friends!"
"I had my first Marijuana Anonymous meeting via Zoom yesterday. I've never felt so supported. 12 step programs seem to get a bad rap. I was very sceptical, especially since I used to be religious and there's alot of what seems like god bothering in the 12 promises. But you know what, I joined the meeting and not one person in the group was religious. They had all found their own defenition of what that meant to them. 

After one meeting I have people messaging me encouraging me to say sober. 

I'm only on day 2, but after years of smoking, I'm feeling hopeful for my future. 

Never forget that r/leaves and groups like MA are genuinely saving lives, and you're saving lives by being an active part of the community. I'm grateful for all of you."
"everyday smoker since age 15; I am 38 now. Dont even know who I am without pot. Never tried to quit before. But its like, cmon- Ive smoked enough in my life to stop now. Been biting my fingernails like crazy all day. on hour 7.... ugh I just watched “alice in wonderland” cartoon and literally every character smokes.  idk what im going to do tonight. not trying to drink alcohol to fall asleep.  pot has been a part of my everyday life for over 20 years... Idk who I am at all or how to deal with my feelings.  its very sad. but im still going to try. ill keep updating my progress. Thank you for being here."
"The withdrawal sucks and I love it I love that I barely slept in the past week and have no appetite. I love throwing up. I love the lack of joy in anything at the moment. I love that I cursed out my boss last night. I love the mood swings and headaches. I love my shitty gym progress cause I'm physically depleted. I love that no one around me cares or understands weed dependency

I love that I'm finally fucking fighting and not accepting the life I've been living. Learn to love what you're going through because you're doing what so many will never even attempt. God bless you all"
Moderation Doesn't exist for addicts. The belief that I could one day moderate literally lead me to decades of continued use. The same process that saw you addicted in the first place is alive and well within you after you stop. It's easy to keep at bay when not using weed but it's easily reignited with any amount of weed. It might not happen over night (though it might happen that way too) but eventually you'll be back at your old levels or possibly worse.
"Four years I made it, my friends. Four years free from drugs and alcohol after 11 years of daily marijuana use.



Four years ago, I chose to enroll in an intensive outpatient substance abuse rehabilitation program. The sessions were two hours, twice a week, for one year. I was exposed to people from all walks of life, all of us united by our shared experience of addiction. The knowledge base was tremendous. It changed my life.



I am grateful for my family. They are rock solid. They have put up with a lot of my bullshit, but they never abandoned me.



I want to thank this wonderful community. You are a constant source of insight, strength, and resolve. 



I am an addict, but I will not smoke today. I wake up every morning, and I climb the mountain. Climb it with me.


EDIT : Thank you so much for the kind words. You all have helped make this day very special.

EDIT 2 : Thank you for the platinum, abeydube! My first Reddit award. :')"
"233 days later........ it is my duty to share the path of discovery I have made through this journey I used to think it was only grass, just a blunt, just an organic medicine that was so acceptable in our culture as being ok.

I used to think that I wasn’t addicted to feeling stoned, for 21 years I felt that I was simply cutting the edge 16 hours a day 

I used to think that I was super functional with just a little vape pen and I was super available to others 

I used to think that marijuana wasn’t any sort of gateway drug to anything else, how could it be it’s just weed right. I got this under control

I used to think I had my life under control, family, house, kids, job 

I used to think that I was truly happy when I was stoned. 

Well I will be honest, that was simply the illusion that my addiction to marijuana was creating.

The reality, for myself, is that at some point of my stoner journey, weed wasn’t able to cover up all my emotional dilemmas anymore. It took 21 years but it happened oh man did it happen!

The strength and amounts just couldn’t do it anymore, I would smoke weed, eat weed, eat CBd, god damn I think I even thought once about snorting weed.  The diamonds, the shatters, the rigs and jigs, the pipes the Rollie’s the candied Rollie’s just to get that feeling of comfort within.  And when the amounts got so great just to get comfortable for a few minutes and so overpowering I just started to drop. And boy did I drop

Mental health was spiralling out of control, so what’s the best and only thing I knew is that I did not feel comfortable......... escalation occurred and voila I now had pharmaceutical speed AND WEED.  Wow, the cherry on top was back I could be with my weed and find all that false comfort again.  BUT WEED WAS NOT THE BLOODY PROBLEM RIGHT!  

My day came like so............... 21 years of pot smoking concluded in a brief moment. This is how it occurred 

Told my wife I needed to go to the spa

Anxiety filled my body due to the 30 lbs I had lost over the past year, I was to scared to show myself at a spa

Drove past

Drove for 5 hours into the mountains, mind spiralling, lost, confused 

Parked my car after getting the famous beyond meat burger 

Sitting in my car windows down 

My wife calls “ how was the spa babe “

I’m honest with her “ I’m not at the spa, I’m sitting in a parking lot 5 hours from home”

My wife “ what?, what are you doing?”

Me “ I don’t know anymore, I just don’t know anymore “

My wife “ come home”

Me “ I have a serious problem “

I felt hopeless, afraid, cold inside like steel, worthless, unloved, scared

The moment I saw and ADMITTED I had a serious drug problem that had been destroying my inside spirit for 21 years I felt really how badly I wanted to quit.  I no longer cared if it was just pot, I no longer lied to myself and said I got my shit under control, I no longer was afraid of asking for help or guidance, I admitted I was lost and I was a bloody addict.  The addiction lies within the user and not the type of substance.  I was just like all the rest of the addicts I had never been able to understand, I had a real problem

Today......... pffffffff.  I have done my work on myself trust in those words.  I am free from the active addiction and that is only understandable on this side of the fence.  

WE WILL ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT JOURNEY THROUGH THIS BUT NOBODY WILL SAY IF THEY ARE ADDICTED THAT ITS WAY BETTER BEING ADDICTED, they just simply can’t.  

This is my HONEST EXPERIENCE 
1. Freedom is so liberating
2. I have REAL confidence in myself
3. I am truly present for those around me 
4. When I deal with emotions I can actually deal with them and know that tomorrow will be a new day. Most of the time it’s very brief and I can resolve them by facing them 
5. My entire outlook on life has changed into something loving and positive 
6. I trust 
7. I now understand that some people can use marijuana freely and at will, NOT THIS GUY. 
8. I have learned that my body is actually a serious machine of self balancing without weed 
9. My mental health is on a whole other level of positivity
10. This is the most critical for me “ I LOVE ME”

So to anybody struggling just know that YOU CAN DO THIS but it starts with self honesty and then WORK ON YOURSELF AND FIND WHAT WILL HELP YOU WALK AWAY from active addiction. Don’t be afraid of being brutally honest with friend and family and build yourself the support YOU NEED.  Remember we are all in this together and there are so many resources available.  
I know for me I had to get help from sources and I followed the guidance from others because no matter how in control I thought I had been I knew I couldn’t control this and I bit my tongue and asked for help. 

And voila I am currently sitting just shy of 8 months, who would have ever thought eh!

Love you all"
"Day 15 after 15 years of daily smoking. Some thoughts on sobriety so far. This is the longest I've gone without weed. Here are some positives I've noticed from quitting so far:

* I'm more confident.
* My social anxiety is totally gone.
* I'm sleeping better than ever (and loving the vivid dreams).
* I don't like video games as much as I thought I did.
* I don't enjoy sitting around like I used to. I'd rather be out doing something.
* My house has never been so clean.
* I don't cough anymore.
* I'm eating a lot less, craving healthy foods, and losing weight.
* I'm happier! I find myself smiling more and laughing at random things.
* My road rage has disappeared and I'm less irritable.
* I'm thinking much more clearly and have better focus.

I'm still dealing with random cravings, but they're getting more manageable every day. Thanks to everyone on this sub for the support."
"Hardly Made Contact, Never Was Good at Baseball. Bong is in 20 Pieces and I’m Read for a Sober 2020. Sitting in My Bedroom Now Without it Sitting Next to Me Feels Weird "
"1st day successfully sober and crying like a baby Back again. Creep my previous posts if you so choose.
context: 4 years use approximately a gram of bong rips a day every single day.

Yesterday was the full moon. I wrote a goodbye letter to weed, and finally made the decision to quit. For good. Never smoking again quit. I don’t smoke weed anymore quit. I wrote those words out in my journal probably 100 times in an effort to rewire my brain against smoking. It actually helped. Just saying it out loud my addict brain was like “heehee okay sure bud” but writing it over and over and over kind of forced the denial out of me.
There’s weed in the living room (my roommates.) I even put away the bong this morning, but i didn’t smoke nor even wanted to. Weed is a fond but terrible memory of the past. I’ve done everything to change my mindset, and I’ve promised myself that no reason will ever be sufficient to smoke— Another thing I wrote out over and over. It has simply taken too much from me so I know I have two choices: let it continue to steal from me or say goodbye. Life A or Life B?

So day 1... my last goodbye hoot was yesterday.

this morning I’m supposed to be in class but instead I’m crying like a baby about all the feelings I used weed to numb. It’s... it sucks.

better out than in I suppose?



UPDATE
 
made it to day two. instead of crying i’m just puking today🤤🥴🤢

ps. gatorade is my new best friend"
"Currently attempting cold turkey on a remote tropical island. **Update:** https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/dfdmuo/desert_island_update_one_addiction_for_another/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

**Original Post:**

Finally snapped. 

On the spur of the moment, I quit my job and used all my savings to buy myself a ticket to a tiny island in the Philippenes. Been here 10 days so far. 50 days until my return flight. Probably a shitty descision but I'm commited now. 



**TLDR;** started great, plateaued, looking for solidarity and others in a similar stage of withdrawal. 



**Background:** 

(which I'm sure is all too familiar to many of you)


26yo, 9 years of being stoned (first joint 6:30 am before I get out of bed etc). Tried and failed to quit more times than I can count. Zero ability to moderate, mentally torturing myself every night for wasting another day of this precious life. 

For most of my life I've been focussed on the external world, flitting from one exciting thing to the next, searching for those little dopamine hits, jumping at every opportunity, agreeing to everthing. Never even taken a day to concentrate on myself. 

I've been high almost every day since I was 17, thus I haven't allowed myself to mature emotionally or socially since then. Don't even know how to deal with my emotions while sober. Weed allowed me to escape boredom, to be happy doing nothing. Suspect some underlying cause to this, perhaps mild ADHD. 

Despite my addiction I've managed to start building a successful career in industrial design, but I know I'm operating at like 20% capacity/effiency.  

Time and time again I tried to quit, and time and time again I failed. I might make it a week or two, but then work/social would get stressful and my willpower would evaporate. 





**Logic behind desert island rehab;**

Didn't feel like my addiction warranted conventional rehab, reinforced by the ""it's only weed dude"" attitude society seems to have. Debatable choice, but that was the descision. I also know I will feel far more proud of myself if I manage to do it on my own. 

I decided I needed a new environment without any stress or commitments, where my only goal would be making it through each day without getting high. Somewhere I could slowly build a routine back into my life, start exercising, start reading again etc. Somewhere with an exciting environment to explore once I was ready. 

I didn't want to be around friends or family during this time. I'm easily distracted, and I felt I needed to force myself to concentrate only on myself for an extended period of time. I also know I get very irratable when I try to quit, and I didn't want to inflict that on those I love and wear them down. 

I also knew I wanted some creature comforts, internet to aid in boredom and to communicate with friends when I need, healthy cheap food on tap, warm weather, the sea to swim in, a bit of the easy life. 

I'm aware that I'm essentially running away from my problems, and I will have to face real life again when I get back, but I felt like I needed to press the reset button, to snap myself out of the spiral, something I couldn't do at home. 

In line with another post I just saw here - when I'm sober I want to smoke and when I'm high I want to quit. I reasoned that buying a ticket during a moment of clarity would force me to adhere to that descision, and not just forget it the next morning. 

So I departed, armed with vallium, a kindle, a laptop and a hammock. 




**Experience so far:**

It's so interesting the psychological state you enter when you just know you can't get weed. Cravings and temptation haven't been an issue. (I'm aware that I can't rely on the lack of avaliblity of weed for ever, but I hope I'll be strong enough to resist when I return) 

Physically I've been a sweaty little mess, cracking headaches etc, but for me the scariest part is insomnia - but I've managed that with vallium, tapered it off from 20mg down to nothing, currently have had two nights sleep without any chemical aid. Feels great. Who knew it was so easy to get up in the morning!?

Feeling my brain come back online has been amazing. Mental clarity, the ability to hold a conversation, even the desire to converse with strangers, the ability to maintain eye contact, the ability to present a genuine smile. 

The island I'm on is tiny, maybe 1km long. It has a village of about 50 people, palm forests, crystal clear water, and a jungly mountain at one end. Im in a hut next to the beach with good LTE and some food stalls within walking distance. Food and accommodation is costing me about $20 a day. Paradise (apart from the nearby typhoon, but you can't have everthing I guess!)

I started out with vigour, excercise, attempted yoga, delving into my books. But I've plateaued, and the past few days I've been escaping into Netflix and my motivation to do anything else has evaporated. This would usually be when I would relapse. Not possible here, and I'm glad I've given myself so long out here. Not gonna be as easy as I thought. 

Emotional wobblies started yesterday, inexplicably found myself in tears. All the things I used to enjoy aren't appealing. Hours building playlists, days fiddling around making tracks on Logic or designs in illustrator - I just can't motivate myself. 

The hardest part is the evening. Usually I would be succumbing to the blissful fog of a hard day's smoking, but without weed I just don't know how to relax. 

I hope this phase passes. I know this will pass. But this is probably why rehab is best done in a group, so you can support each other during times like this. If anyone has read this ramble - thank you! I don't know quite why I'm writing it, probably in search of solidarity or another person going through the same stage of withdrawal. Very much up for DM ing if anyone's keen. 

Maybe I wrote it to remind myself why I'm here. Having done so and re-read my words, I suddenly feel like I can manage to get up and do 20 mins of exercise. Funny how the brain works. 

Good luck to everyone else out there trying to quit. We got this!

**Edit:** 

I have been totally bowled over by the outpouring of support from this community. To know there are so many people out there in similar positions, all able to coalesce into this mutually beneficial network - all rooting for one another, all at different stages of the process, all willing to offer insightful advice and comforting encouragement - what a phenomenon. 

I feel totally re-invigorated - I’m not just doing it for myself now, I’m also doing for all of you. We’re all doing it for each other. I’m prepared for the rest of the rollercoaster, and I’m hanging on tight. 

Also...my first and second silvers all in 24 hrs?! Thank you kind strangers - I totally assumed this post was going to be lost to the chasm.

 r/leaves, you guys are awesome!!!!!!! 

Will update.

"Best high of my life Stopped counting, but its gotta be close to 4 months or something without the whacky backy and I have a major success story to share.

3-4 months ago I was ready to quit my studies because I jsut couldnt hack it anymore. Lots of support, discipline and not having my productivity stifled by weed later, I have completed all the assignments I needed to do to catch up on things I fell behind on in my Master degree.

I have never produced a piece of work I am more proud of; I estimate I put a couple of hundred hours of work and life force into it and it has payed off massively. I cannot remember the last time I felt this good; stone cold sober looking at over 100 pages of analyses I made and tonnes of excel sheets. 

I am now completely back on track and ready to tackle the final part of my degree, the Master thesis. I am certain that I would have never made it to this milestone if I did not make the decision to quit; no more nagging guilty feelings and pressure. 

This subreddit is in no small part to thank for this success story, thank you all for posting your stories. They have helped immensely: the people on their first day posting about the struggle to remind me why I cant go back to my old ways, the success stories of people turning their lives around to give me hope, the stories of relapse that served as a stark reminder and warning, the funny stories that contrast the serious nature of the subreddit and of course the posts offering fantastic advice of how to cope without weed.

That's it I guess, mission accomplished and off to work on the next milestone. I was worried that when I get to this point where I have some respite and time to relax that I'd wanna smoke but now that I'm here, I have 0 desire to do so. I just wanna sleep and play video games for 3 days straight before attacking my next project.  


All the best to yall."
"5 months without cannabis after 10 years of smoking I started smoking on the weekends when i was 16 with a few friends just for fun. I didn't enjoy drinking and hated the flavour of beer and how bloated alcohol made me feel. I am an overthinker so the weed helped surpress that. When i left school and started working, all of the responsibilties made my brain more active than when i was in my teenage years, i started smoking a lot more due to this and i never even realised i became dependant on it. I am 25 now and over the past few years i started to get severe anxiety when high and also SOBER, which never happened before i started smoking, this is the complete opposite effect of the previous 7-8 years of smoking. When locksdowns started happening in March i was a little relieved, it gave me a reason to stop both weed and cigarettes. Since locksdowns have loosened i have been with friends that still smoke and i declined!. The first few weeks were hell due to the increase in anxiety symptoms but i am now over that and i feel great, my anxiety is much lower, lungs are healing, smell better and thoughts feel less clouded. I am curently trying to train myself to use my overthinking in my advantage rather than disadvantage. I know its not good to subtitute but i now give myself Friday or Saturday to have a few sweet alcoholic drinks (still hate beer) just to get a little buzz.

Thanks for Listening!"
"If I give weed an inch it will take a mile Moderation doesn't work for me. Never has and never will. If I let the little monster talk me into a puff, I might as well be conceding the next month of my life. Do not listen to the little monster. Why would this time be any different?"
"Realising it isn't for me Had 5 weeks weed free after being a stoner for the better part of 7 years. Moved interstate to work and didnt have a hookup so it wasn't even an option for the past 5 weeks which made it very easy. Got back yesterday and me and my partner decided to get high after she joined me in sobriety. All it did was make me very anxious, stupid, was questioning everything I was saying as I was so stoned and always thought I wasn't making sense. Very very slow in my thinking/replying processes and not able to focus on tasks at hand in a smart and effective manner.  In my sobriety I found myself in many social scenarios where I may not have been a social butterfly or extroverted but goddammit I was comfortable with the silence and not anxious at all. I dont want to smoke anymore. I want to be quick witted, smart, and good at decision making"
"Feeling Proud - Hit 6 Months Sober Today After a 15 Year Addiction :) Thanks for all the help and support over the months from people here, it has really helped me become a much better version of myself!"
"Im convinced that weed is my fucking devil. Day 7 Maaan, I left the house today to run some errands and for the first time in many MONTHS i wasnt anxious doing it. Holly fuuuck man. Also Im actually able to articulate myself properly in relativly fast paced face to face conversation. 

Weed is totally not for me. Im to receptible to being addicted and Im socially awkward and anxious to begin with, so why did I think holding myself back with this fucking drug was doing me any good?

Thank you so much to this sub and everyone here, you CAN do it, there is something much better waiting for you! It truly gets better every day, if youre feeling bad right now keep in mind that its okay to do nothing today as long as youre staying sober! Im getting a lot of benefits and Im only on day 7! Im so much more motivated to actually change my life for the better and its only gonna get better from here! I love you"
"420 days ago today I took my last drag and beat a 6-year daily smoking habit. This community helped me do it. I'd like to return the favour. As the title says, I have been 420 days without weed today. As this is a special number for us current stoners or ex stoners, I thought it might be a good opportunity to offer to repay the immense support and comfort that this community provided me when I desperately needed it.

I know from experience how difficult it is to kick the habit. So if you want someone to speak to, someone to check in on how you're doing from time to time, just a few tips to get you started, or ANYTHING else, just comment here or DM me. 

I want to help! Stay strong."
"I finally did it!! I told my mum (who I live with) that I've been secretly smoking weed every night for years, and I desparately want to quit. She was super understanding and is going to help me however she can. I've deleted my dealers' numbers and thrown out all my smoking stuff. 

I've already been sober for a month but I kept telling myself it was temporary, that I would smoke again once lockdown was over. But now that I'm sober I've realised I actually quite like not depending on weed. I couldn't have made this decision without reading all the amazing, supportive, encouraging posts on this sub.

Edit: hoooooly shit, I was not expecting this post to blow up like this O.O thank you for all your comments of support, it really means a lot. I know I may be coming off as naive or overly positive but I figured it's best to be optimistic in a situation like this."
"Took a hit after 8mos sober. I was at a friend's house and feeling pretty sure that I'd be able to smoke socially without re-upping and craving to smoke again. 


Well, I couldn't have been more right! We were playing Smash Bros and after I hit the pipe, I couldn't even focus on the game. I started to feel overwhelmed, so I went to chill on his balcony while they played more matches. I watched the cars go by on the highway and tried to keep my heart rate down, so anxious and stuck inside my head. 


Before I knew it, half an hour had passed. I felt better physically, but was upset to be missing out on time with friends. I went back inside, was able to focus again, and had some good hangout time. But I felt so sluggish and cloudy, even hours later. 


What a great reminder of why I ever quit."
"Broke my one month streak last night, valuable lesson taught. Hey r/leaves, my name is Dylan, and I wanted to share my experience with life without marijuana. I decided to quit smoking marijuana last month after smoking non stop daily for a whole year. I decided to go the cold turkey route to show my body that depending on marijuana is not a good thing. For two weeks straight, I was dealing with major withdrawals, waking up in the middle of the night with major anxiety and cold sweats. I pushed through however, and it was the best decision I ever made. That was until last night. I hung out with a friend who quit around the same time as I did and gave me his final nug. I asked if he still wanted his final nug. He told me I could have it and do whatever I wanted with it, he just didn't want marijuana to be around him anymore. I took it home last night and unfortunately, decided to smoke a small bowl because ""it's for old time's sake."" Big. Mistake. Almost immediately after I began feeling anxiety levels that I've never felt in my life. My heart felt weird, my body felt weird, the high just wasn't the same. I decided to knock out, thinking that sleeping it off would help me calm down. I woke up around 4:30 today, still feeling the anxiety. I can officially say that I'm done with marijuana. I hate getting high. It's no longer the ""fun"" experience that it was to me before. Its become a scary experience, one that I would no longer want to feel. I threw away the nug immediately after waking up. My body has finally agreed with me. My life with sobriety has just started, but hopefully my story can help out others that are just beginning like me. Marijuana addiction is horrible, and I would never want anybody else to feel what I'm feeling right now.

edit: missed key detail"
"One year weed free today! It wasn't easy, especially the first 2-3 months but I made it a year! I struggled with PAWs for a while but that is mostly behind me.   At the beginning, I really was in a bad place; it seemed like I experienced all the possible withdrawal symptoms and they were all turned up to 11. I struggled with anxiety, depression, lack of appetite, inability to sleep (when I eventually was able to sleep I would have night terrors, waking up in sweat), headaches, brain fog, etc. You name it, I experienced it.   For the first 90 or so days, I thought I was broken and stuck that way; let me tell you, it gets better.  I now experience legitimate happiness, I am no longer depressed and I can sleep an entire night.  For those reading this, trust me, it gets better."
"Day 600 Today is day 600 sober for me.  

Weed is my drug of choice, don't have issues with anything else.  I have no moderation or control over it.  It's an all or nothing for me.  

Used for 10+ years.  The last 4-5 of that being very heavy all day every day use.  Basically the routine of smoking before and during everything.  

Attempted to quit multiple times, only to be fooled thinking I could use in moderation.  Which would turn right back into smoking all day everyday. 

Got to a point where I was ready to quit for good.  So I started meditating every day for a month or two until I ran out.  Knowing meditation would help me through the month or so of withdraws.  And it definitely did.  Kept up on meditating daily which really helped keep me sober.

Several months after quitting I got a significantly better job, getting my foot in the door to a great career.  Which has been a big help as well.  

If I can quit and stay quit anyone can.  Not saying it's easy because it's not.  I just tried until I found what works for me and keeps me off of it."
"Using Weed in Moderation IMPOSSIBLE for me - Totally abstaining is the only thing that works! 12 Years, 9 Months Cannabis Free

After smoking weed for around ten years, my use had become too heavy and habitual for my liking. I tried to use it in moderation (""only on special occasions"" was what I was going for). Thanks to documenting my progress in a journal, I was eventually able to go back and see how often I'd slipped back to daily use. It felt so maddening to realize that I'd become addicted to this ""totally non-addictive"" substance. It took TEN YEARS of trying (and failing miserably) to smoke weed like someone who can take it or leave it -- I was so envious of people who could do this. For me, if I had it in the house, it would get smoked sooner of later. I had to come to the realization that I was NOT capable of smoking cannabis without relapsing back to daily use. I found a lot of helpful info online, and even joined an online support forum (the name is Uncommon Knowledge Forum -- based in the UK). Online community support, like what's being offered here, was the thing that allowed me to actually quit. 

Reading posts by other people who actually understand the struggle -- that we ""love"" weed, but it's no longer serving us, and we desperately want to quit (but a small part of us still wants to be able to smoke it now and then). The posts I'd read by other people with problematic, habitual weed use rang so true for me, validating my own experience. I no longer felt like some isolated weirdo with a problem I was facing alone: I felt like what I was going through was real, and that others were facing the exact same struggle. My battle felt a bit less overwhelming.

I started a list of ""Benefits of being off weed"" on the forum. Other people added their insights. By encouraging each other to see all the positives of quitting, the days off weed started to string together. I learned some basic tips to stay cannabis free: stay busy, do things that bring me joy (even at first I felt like a fraud, since there was little joy in the early days), surround myself with people who care about me, avoid situations that are going to trigger me (i.e. being super drunk or hungover around people who are smoking weed), treat myself to little rewards with the money I saved.

I am proud to say that after all those failed attempts at moderation, this time I have fully quit. I never want to ""jinx"" it and say that I've successfully quit forever, since there are times when I still get phantom cravings or weird addict-rationalizations about how ""it's been so long, you can have a toke now and not relapse."" I have been off cannabis since July 22, 2006. I still count my progress (in years and months now, not days), and I want to share my story. With weed now legal where I live, and dispensaries selling product near my house, I need to re-up my commitment to stay off. It was fun during the first years I smoked it, but it turned into a limiting addiction, slowly squeezing the juice of life from my existence. Now, after 12 years and 9 months (tomorrow) off weed, my life is better than ever.

I want to say THANKS to all of you in this community. By showing up authentically, sharing our stories and offering support (when asked), we help each other leave our weed habits behind and move into living our lives more fully."
"i went the entirety of 2018 without consuming cannabis, so happy about that! 😇👏🏻👏🏻"
"Leaving r/leaves I'm once again quitting something, but this time it's /r/leaves, and not because I'm going back to the herb. It's because you guys are my one reminder at this point of what I've given up. A week ago, I stopped counting up the days I'd quit, and started counting the days until I had a project due; the days until a midterm; the days until Fallout 4 arrived. You've given me this power; now I need to stop dragging myself down by feeling nostalgic when I see leaves (weird, right?)

Thank you all so much for your support and effort, even if you didn't realize you were giving it. I shall continue to advise those that are having a hard time. I just don't think I need to be part of something meant for quitting. I've already passed quitting.

Now I just need to keep living."
Best decision ever I posted on here on my 9th day. I was struggling and in a very dark place unsure I was able to live that way. Today is day 77 and I’m so happy I stuck with it and allowed myself to love a free life. Today is my first day of college and not having to rely on weed is a dream come true. If you’re struggling just keep pushing because the pain is worth the reward I promise.
"Sticky Brain vs Slippy Brain Here's how I think about weed (and by extension all drugs and alcohol). My vice has always been weed tho.

When we are born, we are constantly learning, and constantly remembering what we learn. Our brains are naturally sticky. We keep our eyes open, see the world, listen to people, take in all kinds of experiences and lessons from the people around us. Our brain is so sticky like fly paper taking everything in.

When we use drugs or alcohol to the point where it becomes habit, or routine, our brains lose their stickiness. And the more we use drugs for longer periods of time, our brains actually become slippery. We can still see and hear what's going on around us, but it doesn't stay in our minds. Memories start to fade, lessons have no meaning, we no longer truly experience anything. Everything just slips away in anticipation of the next toke. And so the cycle continues...

The good news is, our brains are naturally sticky! We can get back to that, it just takes a little self control and a lot of support, but it's worth it to experience life like we used to.

Stay strong my friends."
"Relapsed after 5 years. Starting over tomorrow I hadn’t touched weed in over 5 years until June 8th last month. 

Life has changed drastically since I used to be a stoner, and at the start this year I became increasingly intrigued with reintroducing Weed  for therapeutic and recreational benefits.

June 8th was the day I started smoking again and here’s what’s happened;

I exercised only once since ( I exercise and cross train daily, running, cycling, weight etc usually).  
I basically forgot that for 15yrs of my life I never worked out because Weed creates a force field of contentment with laziness. I’ve managed to reshape my life over the last 4 years to be a generally healthier individual .

I no longer identify with being a stoner but that’s what I’ve been doing these last 3 weeks and it’s been amazing to realize how I used to be to how I’ve grown to be so lazy.

So my quest to be a stoner again has yielded results. Cannabis is no longer of any real benefit to me. 


If anything it’s been largely negative. People have noticed how “stoned” I’ve become. Somebody picked it up at work that I was  tired looking etc. I found this embarrassing.

My girlfriend prefers the older version of me who looks after himself and doesn’t lounge around gaining weight and struggling to stay conscious because I’m so monged. 

I have a wheeze again after 5 years or good respiratory health.

I’ve put on over a stone in weight over the last few weeks too. Damn munchies 

So tomorrow I start without it. Exercise and healthy eating. And some sleepers for possible insomnia if needed.

It’s time to get er done and Start back in a righteous path.

Just thought I’d share."

"3 Tips for Success - what worked for me to finally kick the habit for good 32M - smoking daily for 16 years. Now 60 days sober after years of failed attempts. Here are my 3 keys to success. I hope it helps you:

1. Keep track of your streak and closely follow it. There are countless apps to help remind you when was your last smoke. The bigger the streak the harder it becomes to break. If you are a gamer think of it like a video game high score. Don't keep a mental note. Download an app and add a widget or notification so you're reminded every day the current streak. Streaks that are kept in your head are easier to break. 

2. Decide you are not just someone trying to quit but that you are no longer a smoker. Act like you are no longer a smoker. It makes it way easier to quit when you've made the mental decision that you are not a smoker. People who don't smoke don't ask for hits, call their dealer, engage in cannabis content, bring weed to every activity. It's simply not part of their life. Fake it til you make it. You are not quitting smoking. You are simply not a smoker. 

3. After you are on a streak, even a day, reflect back and ask yourself if you wished you smoked since the last time. Do you wish you spent money on the weed you didn't smoke? Is the high worth being in a worse cognitive state than you are now? 99.99% of the time the answer is no. After 30 days you will feel so much sharper and have hundreds of extra dollars in your pocket. It will be hard to look back and say you wish you spent this money and that the high was worth it.

Hope this helps someone"
"(M22) 41 days clean and sober. Longest stretch I’ve had since I was 12 Today marks the longest I’ve ever been sober since I was 12.

 Title says it all. Just felt pretty good and wanted to share with someone since my drug use has cost me all my friends and most my family maybe you guys could appreciate it! :)"
"I Drove to the dispensary... Just drove here after convincing myself to get shatter and keep it going (it’s been 1 week relapse morning to night) been sitting in the car for 30+ mins trying to think this through 

I read multiple posts...couldn’t convince me

I go to my notes...and I literally have several full notes explaining the same thing over and over again of how much I hate weed and all the bad shit it does to me. It’s crazy how many times I wrote to myself over the years and I keep on relapsing.

One post stood out to me. What would the highest version of me do? What would someone who loves themselves do? 

I’m going to drive home now with the $20 still with me. Tomorrow will be day 2."
"working on day 48, nice to be part of the secret society of people who used to get high I have had an addiction that i have kept secret from most people for over 25 years.  It's nice to have a new secret. My life would be different if I had never used weed at all.  But I am sort of glad to have had that phase.  I sure can appreciate the clarity of a weed free existence now. 

positive momentum leaves"
"I'm 41 years old. Been struggling with marijuana addiction since I was 15. I often wonder how much more I could have accomplished in my life without this chemical crutch. I'm 7 months sober as we speak, though I've been here many times before. I don't want to go back. I can't go back. Weed was always a prominent fixture in my rather disfunctional childhood home. I began smoking at age 14 with with my parent's approval and even encouragement. It's very possible that I would have still eventually developed an addiction to weed on my own, without the impetus of my pot-friendly home environment, but now I'll never know. What I do know is that, in a very real sense, my parents played a leading role in saddling my former innocent, impressionable child-self with this addiction. I find now, all these years later, that I carry around a lot of confusion, hurt, and anger toward my parents for this, especially now that my own son is 15 and I cannot fathom being the poor role-model for him that my parents were for me. That cycle, damnit, stops with me! 💪

Can anyone else relate to this story at all?"
"Today marks 2 years weed free I smoked weed for 6 years from 16-22. I was a daily smoker pretty much from the time I began smoking. I was definitely a ""high functioning"" stoner so that made it pretty easy to excuse my habit. Overtime though, I just began to feel worse and worse every time I smoked. Every day would blend with next, I felt out of touch with myself and all of those around me. I felt like a shell of a person, and I was suppressing all of my emotions with the plant. I tried to quit probably 20 times but had no success...

Until two years ago, when I'd become a not so functional stoner. I had dropped out of college to sell weed, I partied every night, and cared very little about anyone but myself.

Then, one night that changed. I was doing what I always did: sitting in a big circle in my living room, me and my stoner buddies passing around a rig as we each took dabs. 

I had just taken a huge dab and I was dying, struggling to get oxygen into my lungs. I went into the bathroom and I remember I finally got myself together and I just stared into the mirror forever and pretty much just had an epiphany. I decided I was going to quit for real this time. 

It was hard. I tried to maintain my friendships at first but none of them respected the fact that I'd quit. Every time I saw them they'd ask me to smoke, or smoke around me. I also realized that a lot of people hung around just because I always had so much. So, I just had to cut them off all together. 

It was tough and lonely in the beginning. Every thing I'd been suppressing came to the surface and I had to deal with all of it. I had a few panic attacks and started to have really bad anxiety. I was also pissed most of the time, struggled to sleep, and my appetite was pretty much gone. I was in a deep pit of depression. 

I started to exercise, running a few miles every other day and that really sped things up, and helped me deal with the loss of something I was addicted to. I also started to fill that time I used to smoke with more productive things like reading, writing, working, and rekindling my relationships with my family members.

The first year was incredibly challenging, but since then hings have gotten progressively better. 

I've gotten into a committed relationship, went back to school and am majoring in computer science, I started writing again, I've got more money saved up than I ever have in my life, I'm happier and actually deal with my problems as they arise, I'm more assertive, and overall just a better person. 

So if you're struggling to quit, or if you've quit and it seems like nothing is getting better, just keep pushing through. Smoking isn't going to help your problems and its not going to make you feel any better! 

If I can do it, anyone can."
"I didn’t smoke on my evening walk tonight Ever since quarantine began i’ve been going for nightly walks where I would just walk around my town and smoke a joint. It’s lovely, the peace and quiet, and the good vibes. I often walk down to the river by my house and enjoy the sound of it flowing. But suddenly i’d remember that i was walking alone at night, and that i’d have to sneak back into my home without getting caught smelling like weed, and thats when the paranoia sets in. Even though this happens almost every night I still decide to smoke. It’s funny how you forget the feeling the next morning just to experience it again later that night, it’s like a loop. 

But tonight I felt differently. I took a joint and went for a walk, but the entire time I felt like I was battling two sides of me. One side felt so deeply connected to my intuition, and every part of it was telling me not to smoke, but the other side kept luring me back into this loop where i’d tell myself “tonight’s the last night I smoke”, every single night. But I fought the urge the entire walk, I even extended my walk thinking i’d smoke, but I made it home sober and much less anxious than I would have!

Here’s to a happier and more peaceful life without weed. Weed will always be there but you won’t, here’s to 2 days sober :)"
"No weed, alcohol or energy drinks for 41 days I’m hella proud of it. It’s always been easy for me to substitute one addiction for another, only this time I’m committing to healthier addictions like going to the gym and eating good food. It’s not been easy but I’m getting there. If anyone needs help/support I’m always free for you to drop me a message! All the best."
"I broke my sobriety yesterday. Don't let yourself down if you give in. It is not over and you can just continue giving your best. Conscience is everything. Well, I could use the quarantine as an excuse. But to be real here : I decided to smoke again.

I have not been thinking about weed for the last 4 months. Turned my life around, started working out, took more responsibility at work, spent time with my dog and rekindled a lot of social contacts.

After nearly 3 years I feel good about myself again. I have a new flat, it is great and everything is under control. Then this fucking virus starts to cause chaos.

I got I believe 1 gram of a friend of mine. Yesterday I decided to smoke like half a joint from it. It was ok, nothing special. It is still the same. I went to bed, woke up today and continued as nothing happened.

I guess since I am not planning on becoming the stoner again (like from the bottom of my heart) it just wasn't that big of a deal to me. I am not disappointed, I am relieved somehow. That it didn't feel as good as I thought it would. That I am fine by leaving it be and be that guy who smokes occasionally. 

My sobriety will continue. I will just forget about it and continue everything I got going the last few months.

Don't be mad at yourself. Just continue with your efforts. It will get you somewhere in the end!"
"7 DAYS SOBER AFTER 18 YEARS DAILY USE, WHHAATTT Today is day 7. I can't believe it. Without even a nibble of an edible or scraping my bowl like I have done my last few times I quit. I'm honestly shocked. 

I wish I felt better though. I'm still tired af and sleep sucks. I hope that changes soon. I was hoping for some dramatic transformation. But we will see. I'm determined to hit day 30. Then 60. Then 365."
"Today is day 6. Rough day. Just got back from picking up some weed. I get a text from one of my best friends who knows I’m trying to quit telling me about this sub. Completely changed my mind. I have been smoking weed daily for over 2 years. I tell myself it’s okay because I usually don’t smoke til the evening. But I’ve realized that it’s one of the only things I look forward to, it’s something that inhibits me from living my life to the fullest and actually going out and doing things. It needs to stop. 

I moved across country last month, living in a place where I’m constantly surrounded by people, yet I know no one except my co-workers. It’s a strange feeling, living in a place where you are constantly surrounded by people, but really you’re completely alone.

I woke up this morning, to a rainy, dreary day on my day off. I haven’t found much to fill my time without work making my boredom painfully real and depressing. To add to this, I step outside to notice my lock has been chopped on my front porch, and my bike, which I cannot afford to replace has been stolen overnight.

I spent the better half of my day walking around town, checking local pawn shops and filing a police report. On top of this it had begun to rain heavily, I was cold uncomfortable and miserable.

After this I went home and tried to distract myself with video games, but this just ended up making me feel even more lonely, bored and useless. Another few hours went by, I thought the rain had passed, so I went down to the beach, where I normally go to clear my head, only to be rained on some more. 

In a depressive state, I said fuck it and on my way home I went into the local dispensary and bought some THC caps. I contemplated popping one right then and there on my walk home. But however I decided to wait until I get home, and really think about if I wanted to break my 6 days of sobriety. 

I sat on my couch, turned on Netflix and was about to take one. Just before I did, I checked my phone, to notice a text only minutes prior from my roommate and best friend back home. He knew I was trying to quit and informed me of this sub. It’s almost as if, in this moment, he felt my depressive state and reached out to me moments before I went too far, without even knowing it. 

As soon as he mentioned it, I looked at this sub, read multiple stories of people struggling just like me and decided, no I do not want to break my short lived sobriety. 

So for that, I thank all of you for taking the time to tell us, in this sub how you were feeling, how you’ve overcome that urge to smoke, and how awful you’ve felt when you break your sobriety. Your story means more than you know, keep with it, and thank you for reading mine. 

And to my best friend, my brother who reached out, love ya man xx."
"If you manage to stay sober for just 7 days... ...You won't believe how well you sleep, the vivid dreams you have, and how energized you feel in the morning.

I used to feel awful in the mornings even after sleeping 7 or 8 hours.  Now I feel with a clear head and ready to take the day.

It's a myth that weed doesn't have a hangover effect like alcohol does.  It's not as strong or noticeable but once you go sober - you really realise it."
"Anyone else had Cannabinoid Hypermesis Syndrome? So I’m 22, I’ve been a daily green smoker for 3yrs. All of a sudden I got sick, really sick after smoking one day. I I felt nauseous so I ate a salad for lunch and then proceeded to aggressively vomit that up straight away accompanied by extreme nausea. I assumed it was the food and then had another cone. Then continued to vomit with ongoing nausea in between for about 8 hours. I got so dehydrated and the nausea was so awful I drove to the E.R. They told me it was gastro. So I went home and woke up feeling better. Next week after smoking one day again I got the same cyclic nausea and vomiting until I drove to the E.R again. After many hours of them trying every anti nausea medication they could they asked me questions about my cannabis usage and came to the conclusion I had Cannabinoid Hypermesis Syndrome and the only thing to stop it from happening again would be to quit. I gave up cold turkey. It was really disheartening to hear I couldn’t smoke anymore since I have BPD & Bipolar and was something I leant on to control my emotions & it was basically the only thing that connected me and my friends. But as the days went on I felt more and more positive about this happening to me and thinking it could’ve been a blessing in disguise. 

I threw out all my paraphernalia and weed, Ive said no to seshes with my friends. It’s been 40 days. I’ve started to think clearer, more rationally, I’m able to express how I feel fluently and intelligently, less word blanks, feeling more social, my dreams are cooler, I’m thinking about my future more, I’m taking account for my shitty decisions in my life, I have more energy, I’m being more creative, open to more healthy activities, realising those who smoked with me no longer served me as we were actually nothing alike and all I was doing was numbing out with them. I realised all the emotions I was suppressing wasn’t actually helping anything but delaying it all to be processed and un-wound when I was sober. All these events from the past are resurfacing in my mind, my perceptions are changing for the better, I’m not de-motivated and have changed my eating & exercise like I’ve been meaning to for the last 3yrs! I’m so happy that this shitty condition was the push I needed to make this huge leap to my highest self. I’m pretty damn sure that I would’ve kept it as a daily for many more years and been de tracked off my real goals for who knows how long. 

Just wanting to know how many others have experienced this condition as I haven’t heard anyone ever speak of it. 

Thanks for reading, first post in this awesome supportive group 💕"
If you feel like shit and want to smoke Just remember that afterwards you’ll still feel like shit except plus a headache and a brain fog and it won’t make it any better. I started smoking to help me like chill out and not be consumed by my overactive mind. Turns out that adding weed to that just adds additional problems and doesn’t help anything. Feeling like shit sober is better than feeling like shit high. Like seriously. When you feel like shit sober there is the possibility of actually taking actions to change your scenario. Once you feel loke shit high you def just gonna feel way worse and trapped and literally not good at all. Just bear down and wait for your dopamine levels to stabilize. I don’t think I’ve ever in my life literally ever have I ever gone “I am glad I was high for that.” So much bs propaganda out about weed pushed by junkies that aren’t honest with themselves and just want everyone to be miserable with them. This drug is shit fucking garbage. Feel like shit sober. Feel the pain. I hate weed so much now. Youre addicted to the compulsion and your idealization of an expected effect that you literally won’t get. I’m so disappointed in myself for falling for this shit for so long.
"Day 414 without weed. Living a better life. Hey Guys,

I've been lurking for so long, I can't even tell anymore.
Decided to share my story and thank all of you for supporting me without even knowing.

I (M28) started smoking weed at 13 yo and have been smoking (with several short pauses) pretty much all my life until last january. There were times I smoked less (several times a week to 0.5 gram daily) and times I smoked heavily (2-3 grams a day) but for most of the time I was smoking on a daily basis. 

Weed never felt like it would destroy my life but rather always felt like a good old friend I could always rely on. That is, what I consider it's greatest danger. The sublety of weed, making so many things so much more difficult.

Despite being diagnosed as a highly gifted kid at a young age and skipping first grade because I was able to read, write and do most of elementary school level maths in kindergarten.
 I often struggled in school, not because I couldn't follow the lessons but because I was often high in school or skipping school because of being high. In the end I still graduated my country's equivalent of high school, but had very bad grades and at some point almost got kicked out for being absent.

At 18 I moved out of my parents house and started going to university about 500km away. Living in a student dormitory I quickly started to bond with pretty much every other pothead and weed became an even bigger part of my life. 

When I went to the university it was almost exclusively for the few mandatory courses, exams or at a later point to work as a tutor. For the most part, I was just in that city to party and do drugs.
 I studied for 6 years and didn't even get my bachelors degree, even though I even wrote a bachelor thesis.
As a result of years of taking nothing serious, I got kicked out for screwing up my last try for an exam from the 2nd semester. 

In 2012 I lost my driving license due to driving while high and I never bothered to do a 1 year drugscreening with a psychological assessment of my driving capabilities until last year.

After university I got a place in a 3 year apprenticeship with very low pay. My boss knew why I wasn't allowed to drive and he tolerated it for the course of the apprenticeship (since the process of getting back my license costs a shitton of money I didn't have) but after that included me being able to drive as a necessity for the following employment contract.

This was, what finally gave me the incentive to get my shit together. I quit smoking cold turkey, did the drug screening, got my driving license and a car, got a job with a decent starting salary and am looking forward to moving into a house with my girlfriend of 6 years (living together for 3,5 years in a small appartment).

For the first time in my life I feel like a worthy adult and not as a teenaged fuck-up. I could have had all that happiness and security so much earlier if I wasn't stoned all the time. 

During all that process I often read the posts in /leaves to remind me what it felt like, when i relapsed the first couple times and had to start again. Your encouragement of every single one of us struggling might not have been the reason I didn't relapse but it was the reason it was easier to stay strong. Thank you.

Sorry for the huge wall of text but I got carried away.

To all of you still struggling:
In the beginning, quitting weed might be hard, but it gets easier. Slowly at first, but there will come a point at which it gets easier every day. Soon you will hit the point at which you don't miss it anymore. Stay strong."
630 days clean. Feels AWESOME 
"I just hit my 1 month sober mark. I would not have mad it this far without this subs daily encouragement, so thank you. "
"50 Reasons Why I'm Quitting Weed Mary Jane, we’ve had some amazing times, but I think it’s time we end things. We’re no good for each other.

I’ve been smoking weed for 3 years consistently and daily for about 2. Throughout this time, I have maintained a semblance of a normal life: going to school, working, and making friends, but I’ve become complacent. I happily wore the stoner title like a badge of honor, proud of the fact that I’d somehow managed to achieve all I had while smoking as much as I did. It took me two years of missed deadlines, broken friendships to realize how backwards that was. Winners justly boast about the hurdles they’ve overcome, but not the ones they’ve laid out for themselves.

I’ve always made my decisions based on pros and cons of the options, and when I started considering dropping weed I realized quickly much weed worked against me. Weed burns holes in your lungs, your clothes, and your memory. Ironically, I would usually realize how little I enjoyed smoking weed when I was high, and those thoughts would fade. But they, unlike so many high thoughts, were rational. So I wrote them down – I made a list. So that even with my clouded memory, I could remember the reasons I need to stop.

At the time of writing, I’ve tried quitting 3 times. The first time I wasn’t committed, and lasted about 5 days. The second time, I tried harder, but got to day 10 before I faltered again. This is my third time, and I’m holding myself to this. I’ve throw out my pipe. I’ve given away my grinder. I’ve shattered my bong and I’ve burnt through all my weed.
 
I need someone to stay committed to. Every day for the next 20 days, I am going to return to this thread and write a comment. I might do more, but I sure as hell won’t do less. This isn’t for attention, this isn’t even really for anyone to see. This is just me finding someone, or something, to be accountable to. Because being accountable for myself isn’t working. I’ll make my first comment tomorrow.

I’ve also attached “50 Reasons I Need to Quit” in no particular order below. Hopefully someone, somewhere, can get something out of this.
 
1.      It makes you lethargic, tired, and lazy.
2.      It gives you anxiety, for a good reason.

"I had chinese food yesterday and my fortune cookie said ""Keep up the good work. You will be rewarded."" If that's not a sign I don't know what is.

I'm on day 16 or so and have had some iffy moments lately due to boredom etc. but man, that cookie. 

I laughed my ass off. 

Keep going everyone, we can do it!"
"Has Quarantine made it 10X harder to quit for any of you? Live in California, there is 3 dispensaries within a 10 mile radius from my home. I haven't been at work cause of quarantine and haven't been able to gym or jiu jitsu either. I had a good 5 month sober run and felt amazing and relapsed on 4/20 and have been trying to quit every day since but it seems so hard cause I don't do anything during this quarantine and feel so helpless :("
"Today marks 1 year free from weed I'm going to keep it brief since that other dude has a huge post with some good advice in it. For me, today marks 1 year since I last toked. I have one year free from weed and 100 something days from alcohol and all other drugs.  Weed was my drug of choice but unfortunately for someone like me, I tend to get a little too excited about other substances in its absence so I've cut off everything.

Maybe in time that will change but for today I've never felt better being clean.

I spent a decade smoking obsessively and all it really was in the end, was a giant waste of time. I was a pretty hardcore smoker, but I did it before those carts and stuff came on the market though my friends and I sure did dabs and stuff with a blow torch rig when we could get grams of oil. 

What I've learned during my time in sobriety is that drugs do not make me happy, people make me happy. I am not as much of an isolator as I thought. Connections with people make me happy. It is through those relationships that I find true happiness. 

I used to use 1-2oz a month and thought I could never quit. I've learned a lot of ways not to quit.

What works for me is hanging out with other sober people. I love going to my weekly MA meeting (though I also attend other 12 step fellowship). During those meetings I can see that I'm not alone. I can help other people and by doing that, they help me. We do it together.

I am honest. Honest with myself first and then honest with others. Honesty and fellowship.

Together we can do what I cannot do alone."
"Things Ive noticed after 19 days of being sober. - Im not depressed as much
- I eat healthier, I feel healthier
- Suddenly day seems to have more hours than before
- I sleep 7 hours a day instead of 10++
- I dont need to worry about money anymore
- I find joy in simple things like cooking or reading
- I cleaned my room first time in years (yes, years)
- I went to see doctor (stomach problems) that I was afraid to go to for a year
- I bought 6months swimmingpool ticket
- Watching youtube/tv shows seems boring af now so Im constantly looking for other things to do
- Sweets dont taste so good, actually I dont even think I like them anymore (bag of chips plus bar of chocolate plus mountain dew was my regular supper before)
- Before I wouldnt answer my phone if not high (lol), now it's not a problem
- I can look into other peoples eyes without sweating (lol2)
- At work (taxi) I dont need to worry if my clients can smell weed anymore
- My brain is getting sharper, I dont mumble anymore, I can speak without ""yyyyyy"" after each sentence



I still need to improve a lot but it's getting better and I feel a little bit motivated (before the only motivation to get out from bed would be to smoke).

thanks for Reading and good luck to every single one of You,

Lukasz"
"My girlfriend broke up with me because I am a piece of shit 
I am 18 years old and I have been smoking weed everyday since I was 15 years old. Four years ago my family lost everything in a house fire and my dad didn’t handle it well. He became a heavy drinker and it spiraled down quick. In February 2016, my father went into cardiac arrest. I quickly started smoking heavily as a terrible, but easy coping mechanism. Shortly after this my dog Stella was hit by a car and killed. My mom wasn’t handling this well either, and she became a severe alcoholic as well. I wasn’t any better than her, though.

The more and more I smoked, the more and more I set off my problems to the next day. These problems rooted themselves in my brain, manifested my soul and controlled my entire life. Where I was once a joyful, hopeful young man, I turned into a cold, miserable, heartless soul. I was sad all the time, suicidal, would snap at family members over the smallest of disagreements, want to fight my own friends, sleep all day: I had no quality of life.

Then comes along girlfriend. She was amazing. She put up with all my shitty habits, my anger, sleeping all day, and she only wanted to help. She tried to get me to go to counseling, get a doctors appointment and held me when I wanted to cry. Everything she did revolved around making me happy. But I still wasn’t. I still smoked everyday & I put off every bit of advice she gave me. I snapped at her the same way that I snapped before at my mother, my brother, my friends. Because that’s what I do. She deserved nothing but love and respect, and I gave her bullshit. She came over to my dorm yesterday and told me she just couldn’t be with me anymore. She told me she loved me and we hugged and cried for hours. I couldn’t be mad at her, I knew I was terrible. Now, when it’s too late, I just want to scream how sorry I am. I love that girl so much, she was the only thing good in my life.

I felt that getting high was the only thing numbing the pain. I am terrified of the all too familiar darkness that comes with sobering up. But I am ready for that. I have set an alarm for midnight, for at midnight I will no longer be smoking weed. No more nicotine. No more sleeping until 2 P.M., and for gods sake no more fucking excuses. I can’t feel this way anymore. I either have to pick myself up and fight this, or it is going to kill me."
"Day 4 after 24 years of heavy use- here are the reasons I quit These are the reasons I wanted to quit that I listed in my journal while I was still smoking. 

- remember my life. Experience life and then have memory of those experiences

- better relationship w my husband (he couldnt stand that I did it but really and truly he never knew the extent to which I smoked). I've been lying to him for years about it and it just made me feel like such a bad person. 

- save several hundred dollars a month

- can plan a trip anywhere and not worry about how I would bring pot or get it there 

- my health- my cough, my lungs

- no regrets when I'm on my death bed

- won't get munchies and eat shitty food 

- will be more articulate at work. My company deserves better. They treat me so amazingly and I've been high the whole time 

- take control of my life and not the other way around

- no more risk of driving w it 

- no more having to go to my drug dealer. Nice guy but ugh I hated having to go

- actually feeling my emotions

- wrinkles. I'm 41 so smoking only makes you look older. Period. 

- all the hiding. I smoke everywhere I go. Cant tell you how many places that I've snuck in my cart,  went to the bathroom and was getting high as a kite w no one the wiser 

- the smell. I love the smell don't get me wrong but I hated how it stuck to me and could get me caught if the wrong person smelled it.

- better memory. I have 3 college degrees (got all 3 being high as a kite ugh) but I don't remember shit so when people talk about intellectual things I say ""yeah I think yada, yada,  yada."" because I don't freaking remember even though I know I've learned or experienced what they are talking about

Beginning of day 4 for me  I'm actually feeling really good. Bad night sweats, and lots of boredom but I've been getting mentally prepared for the worst so I'm just taking it hour by hour. Day by day. 

This sub is what has 100% helped me make this decision. And at this point it is exactly that- a decision I'm making. 

One thing I'm so grateful for is that I'm making this decision and it's not being forced on me by my job, husband, or the law (I live in an illegal state).  

Wr can do this!"
"Day 5: Three days of hell but it’s getting better. Running, hot yoga (sweat that shit out) Advil, water, faith, walking the dog & this forum are saving me. All about choosing new habits. Hope my fellow New Yearers are doing well, considering the circumstances. We got this!! "
"A week clean and something occurred to me Hi everyone, I haven’t smoked anything the past week and I feel neither happy or disappointed about it. It just is. What struck me more though is that I’ve been battling and trying to quit since about April. Sometimes I’d go as much as a month without smoking and think to myself, “okay I’ve got it all under control, then I’d light up and have to start all over again.

I listened to podcasts on my drive to and from work. I was listening to one where a navy SEAL and green beret were talking and more specifically they were talking about community. The green beret said that after he left the army he went through a real hard track in his life as he didn’t have a mission or real purpose. He said the army teaches that if you have even just one person, a community of two, you can cover 360 degrees. If you’re by yourself though you’re always leaving blind spots.

It just clicked as soon as he said it. I’ve got friends and people I hang out with regularly. I’m not some loner, but I don’t know anyone that would really understand this or what I’m going through. In a way, I still feel alone because people wouldn’t be able to relate or really understand. Then I realized that I’ve been doing this wrong and that if I want to better myself and stay on the path, then I need to reach out to this community. To all of you wonderful people.

None of us are alone. Stay strong. Thank you for reading.

Edit: Thanks for the silver!"
"255 Days ! NO WEED! It seems impossible until it's done.

That shit was addictive AF for me 😑🤨"
"It's amazing how your personality changes after being sober a while. The mental adjustment to a new sober person, and new lifestyle takes time. But in the long run, it's a good thing. "
"5 months after quitting smoking, I made a collage for my art class trying to resemble my struggle to let go of the high. My reality was bleak, while my head was losing grasp of reality. Quitting was one of the best decisions of my life! "
day 1. Can I get an Amen! this is it. no more. Basta. From Prada to nada. Not smoking today and rest of 2020. help
"Wondering how many people have quit for a while then thought they could try it again as a one off and went back to smoking it regularly? So i stopped for around 3 months last year and I decided to have a stoner weekend thinking I’ll just have some and finish it on the Sunday and be in control then go back to normal. Oh how I was wrong, I ended up smoking every day again up until 5 days ago. I genuinely feel like it doesn’t matter how long I stay clean I can never try it again as a “one off” or anything like that. Anyone else had this happen or similar? How did you feel knowing you can probs never do it again even as a one off or anything like that?"
"3 months off weed and cigarettes : anxiety / mild depression kicks in, still. University professor, at my early 50’s, quitting weed and cigarettes after 30 years. Approaching 3 months off both, no relapse.

The good things;
- mental clarity
- energy and strength 
- waking up easily in the mornings 
- lungs, throat, breathing, MUCH better already
- no weight gain 
- no bipolar behavior (from lying in bed till afternoon and feeling hopeless, to working like crazy and feeling like a semi-god)
- no severe cravings, after month 2.

The bad things:
- a periodic anxiety (comes every week / two weeks, stays for some days, leaves), triggered by anxious dreams, starting in the morning. If it stays more than a couple of days, triggers a mild depression. Makes me not wanting to work / avoiding decisions / feeling overwhelmed. But, it goes away when I just stay in bed, relaxing (the period helps).
- procrastination. Was there with the weed, too, but now I do not have the weapon of getting high, to battle. Result: less work drive, lower self-esteem.
- anhedonia: less sex drive, less drive for playing music or hanging out with friends (the last two I avoid as they were weed-connected). A feeling of boredom, of missing the “high”. 

The aids:
- exercise (2-3 hours a week, plus 3 km a day walking away the dog). 
- meditation (daily, 10 - 20 minutes headspace)
- reading (non fiction, literature, Reddit, 1-3 hours per day)
- eating with caution / drinking with caution
- traveling, when not too down. 
- supportive spouse 
- therapy (monthly)
- a couple of very close friends /ex weed users, too
- telling people about it (to close ones about quitting weed, to the rest about quitting smoking) - creates some “space”, justifies a “leave me alone, I suffer”attitude .

No meds, no nicotine, no cannabis.

Despite the struggles, I feel determined.

Any suggestion welcome !"
"Anyone else quit smoking because of mental health? I was using carts almost every day for months, which isn’t good because a lot of the carts were really strong. My mental health slowly got worse as I started getting more depressed and anxious. I didn’t even enjoy smoking after a few months but I did because I couldn’t sleep without it."
"RE: Boredom To those who have asked about coping with boredom:

I'm five months into sobriety and there are not enough hours in the day for me to get all the things done. I have more interests and energy than I can remember. Trust the process: there will eventually be a switch and, all of a sudden, you'll find yourself busy and energetic. It may take a while, but it happens."
"4 years without and just popping in I smoked everyday from 14 to about 28. Needed it to sleep, needed it to be normal, essentially needed it to function in what i thought was everyday life. When I first quit I used this and other forums for support so though I would come in now. 

If I was trying to quit during this time where, for a lot of people, you are being given time off work then I would have made up alot of excuses to pick up.

Weed made up my life for years and it took a lot of effort to pack it in. When I first quit I couldn't imagine life with out it and thought about it every minute

This is the first time I've thought about it in years.

I've gone from some one who needed it to function to having a fleeting thought about it because I've been on full pay for 2 months and no work to do, and old stoner buddies in the same position reconnecting with me.

It doesn't matter how much you think it's part of you, and part of your life, you can leave it behind you too."
"So proud of all the 20 something year olds, who have decided quit. In today's society, and the changing laws, and peer pressure. It's gotta be pretty difficult to want to maintain a clean and sober lifestyle. It takes a hell of a lot of willpower and determination to want to change a lifestyle that can be a bunch of fun when you're young.

In my 20's friends called me smoky. I lit up every chance I could. Looking back I wish I had the smarts like you guys. I wish someone had told me I was abusing it. 

No matter how you're feeling after quitting. Just know you are accomplishing  something great and beneficial to your life. Keep plowing forward and congrats."
Just threw my pen in a dumpster across town The only way I use is pens and I just tossed mine all the way across town in an actual nasty dumpster. I can't buy another one because I dont have a medical card anymore. Wish me luck.
"I am the best me without weed I am satisfied with mediocrity when I am high. I am less social when I am high. I am less productive when I am high. I am less motivated when I am high. My emotions are suppressed when I am high. I am unfulfilled when I am high. 

I am more anxious and I have extreme mood fluctuations when I am sober. I have realised that weed has been a coping mechanisms for my anxieties for a long time. I have been smoking everyday for 3 years. If I don't tackle my issues with a sober mind, things will never get better and I will never regain all my positive traits that weed suppresses.

I am the best me without weed.

When I think of my life with this perspective, it makes quitting feel obtainable."
"I smoked for 17 Years Daily multiple times a day. 8 Days of no Marijuana. Hey, I am so glad I found this reddit.  I have been reading through all of your posts and can't help but smile and tear up a bit because it's exactly what I feel is needed for anyone considering or actively quitting to smoke pot.

Like the Title says, I smoked daily multiple times a day for 17 years.  I am now on day 8 of 100% no intake of weed.  That first night, you know I was looking for rug nugs on the ground, in the cushions, wherever I thought I'd find a little puff.  Luckily for me, it was a failed search.  (I say lucky now, but at the time I was PISSED)

After a week I can safely say my dreams are insanely vivid.  I have been able to dream in color, remember my dreams, the detail is better than I can actually remember my dreams ever being.  The hard part is getting to sleep and eating, but when I get into bed I actually smile thinking this dream is probably going to blow my mind!  The hardest part for me is, I don't have much going on in my life at the moment so my daily habits are very similar to what they were before.  I chill at my computer and instead of playing games most of the time, I end up watching documentaries (and actually remembering more than snippets), reading up on stuff that's interested me such as sailing and going to the library to find more information on Sailing.  (I've never sailed before in my life and the ocean terrifies me, but I want to do it some day)

Day 1-5 - The most Frustrated I've been mentally in a long time.  I have been rude to my family and snapped over menial things.  I explained to them why I am snapping, but that doesn't justify me being a jerk.  I will have to apologize again and again, hoping for their forgiveness over time.  The physical difference I've noticed during those first five days would be; My brain is functioning differently.  Things that interested me before when I was high, are boring as hell.  I loved gaming but during those days, I would get on a game and stare the screen, maybe join in and be bored after 4 minutes.  It wasn't the same without weed.  I was thinking how the hell can people play games sober all the time?  Insanity! I explained to my close friends from online communities (10+ years of friendship) that I needed to change myself to improve who I was in life.  I feel so unsuccessful spending as much money as I did on pot, instead of saving it.  I think money is a really smart thing to think about when you consider smoking.  Even if you don't spend a lot, write down how much you would be spending and add it up.  It's kind of gross how much I personally was spending on weed and not saving for my future self.  That sum really wakes me up and gives me hope.

&#x200B;

Day 5-7- I Still was frustrated but some things were really becoming enjoyable again.  Being around other people was one of the best things I could have done, especially if they know what you are trying to do.  I say that because some of my friends still smoke, so I explained to them to refrain from mentioning it, telling me about it, just anything that would make me think about it.  (obviously I knew they were smoking but the not talking about it like we normally would is a good change for the person trying to quit).  It sounds cliche but it really is very important to share the information to the people you surround yourself with, because they will help you if they are your friends!  I have received NOTHING but support from these people, so I suggest being open with your close friends as well.  These were the days I just thought, smoking would be so nice right now but I have never been this distanced from smoking before I started years ago.

&#x200B;

Day 8- I am willingly writing about what's going on for me because guess what, it helps!  Talk to people about what you're going through and explain the frustrations.  They will listen and maybe even give you some advice or suggestions to stay busy.  That's key, staying busy!  I am fortunate to have an amazing dog that loves to go on walks (more than me) and that might be the best thing to break a sweat and change the scenery.

My advice for the annoying feelings that come with refraining from smoking - Hot Showers.  If possible crank it to as hot as you physically can tolerate.  The smell of soap and shampoo mixed with the steam just feels amazing and calming.  If you are extremely frustrated or anxious, get in a HOT shower!  Maybe go for a walk before hand to combine exercise and the steam for an even more effective treatment.  I don't know what this post will do other than help me get my thoughts out to others who may be in a similar situation.  I promise you during the first few days I was incapable of writing up this much and not wanting to smash my screen out of boredom.  I still feel slightly bored, but I realize each day I go without smoking, is another day closer to clarity.  Those dreams though! They are a phenomenal experience and I really think even if you aren't going to stop smoking, distance smoking and sleeping to experience it yourself.

&#x200B;

Here's Olive who has helped me immensely by keeping me busy!  Instead of buying pot, go adopt a dog! (still less expensive than smoking daily)

"Been basically clean since quarantine started and I’m feeling like a new person I’ve been basically clean since quarantine started. I’ve decided to stop counting the day because whenever I slip up I get so discouraged that it make me not want to start up again. I’ve discovered that even if I slip up and take an edible or hit a wax pen, that doesn’t mean I need to throw away all my progress! A single mishap doesn’t mean I should just go back to daily smoking like I was. None of us are perfect and sobriety isn’t a perfect process either! I don’t use this as an excuse to smoke whenever I want but it does give me the ability to forgive myself for not being perfect and continue to make an effort to live a sober life away from weed."
"So I told my Dr I quit smoking weed, here’s what he told me: First he congratulated me and told me he was proud of me, he asked has it been hard so far (day 23) oddly, no, I told him, my husband still smokes, my friends have passed around a joint at the dinner table, it doesn’t even tempt me, in fact it smells gross now, keep in mind I’ve been a pretty dedicated stoner for 40 years, I’m just over it.  He told me, ‘You will get the urge again, sooner or later, and it won’t even be under stressful circumstances, it will just pop out of nowhere and when that happens, because, it will, find something else to do.’ So, ok that.  
I mentioned that my sleep patterns are messed up, and my weird dreams were, well, weird, and unpleasant to say the least, he explained that my brain is trying to rewire itself from years of having to work alongside of chemicals, to be patient it will figure it out, no comments on decoding the dreams, they are just your brain working things out, could be something you saw, ate, heard, it’s just our subconscious processing, and if you’ve been suppressing things as long as I have via weed, it’s possible that it’s going back along way, it will pass.
He mentioned that because I’ve been self medicating all these years, it’s possible that i could find that I have issues that I didn’t realize, ie depression or anxiety, to name a couple of many, and that if that’s the case, then seek help from a professional, to manage it responsibly.  
(If anyone is suffering from depression, or other mental illness, I recommend checking out ‘the bloggess’ aka Jenny Lawson, she owns her mental illnesses so hard, and she is funny as hell and you will find a tribe that lets you know you’re not alone) 
ok back to the Docs input:
To date, there is no irrefutable evidence that smoking pot permanently damages your brain the way alcohol does, with time, and patience, your brain should be functioning just fine, he said in my case, at least 3-6 months, which I find amazing and encouraging.
It’s a good idea to start challenging your brain, not with stupid word games, he said, but with something that interests you, reading literature, learn a language, exercise your brain, your memory will return. 
Again, he mentioned be patient and stay strong. 
He took X-rays of my lungs because I never feel like I get a good satisfying deep breath, there is nothing conclusive, they are a little bit enlarged which could indicate COPD but we agreed that I would try and exercise a little harder than I have been so I really force myself to breathe heavily, and see if in a few months, they don’t feel better. If not, we can do more tests. 
So, for all y’all out there freaking out that you fried your brains or worse, I hear you, but take heart, it’s all reversible, but you need to stay strong, stay disciplined, stay focused on the rest of your life, good night and good luck!
Also, y’all are amazing, I look at the posts and  positive kind people that respond to those who reach out and I realize we come from all over the world, we are a tribe, of good people, who have so much empathy and there’s so many of us, from all walks of life, with a common goal that unites us: we want to be better, we want to do better, and it gives me hope, that the world isn’t completely filled with assholes. So thanks for that, everyone! Love and light to you all 💋"
"Currently at the gym at 1:30 am. Day 2, have been smoking for the past 6 years almost daily and even worse once my mom died  in 2017. Can’t sleep and the cravings are bad so I forced myself to go to gym. Idk why I’m making this post, I guess I just wanted to tell someone who might care."
"I can’t believe cravings do actually pass, for real I had been having these strong urges for the past three days, due to my depression taking a toll on me again, but I managed to not cave in somehow. I’m gonna be honest: I dialed my dealers twice but they somehow did not respond, so there’s that. Today, at the library, I felt like this “abstinence thing” is pointless and decided to get home to call my dealers once again. As soon as I got home, I fell asleep and when I woke up, I did not feel any urges at all. I deleted those dealers’ numbers and I did laundry and I’m going out for a dinner with a friend in about an hour. In conclusion, if you’re having cravings, try to just safely relax. I know it’s not easy, but trust me, it’ll pass. It will surely pass. Anyway, just wanted share my story to keep you guys encouraged and motivated. I’m on day 14 and I will not break the chain, no matter what. Peace, love you all! "
"3 months!!! Congratulate me please!! plus: the good & the bad I hit 3 months a couple days ago and I wanted to make a post about my experience. This sub has been huge for me. This is the longest I've gone without weed (by far) in 5 years. The first month was hard, the second month was much easier, and the third month was kinda hard again so I'm really proud that I haven't relapsed.

The good:

* Bags under my eyes have disappeared! It took like 2 months but wow it's really true! It's crazy to think I didn't get a good night's sleep (with REM) for 5 years.
* Joy, creativity, hunger, sleepiness; these things come up naturally now, rather than needing to be smoke-induced every time. At first weed amplifies these things but with regular use it becomes the only way to experience them.
* I'm taking care of my teeth regularly.
* I watched the new Rick & Morty episodes without getting high; I don't think I've ever watched the show sober before but it was still really funny and I think it was easier to follow the story. It's freeing to not feel like I have to be high before I can watch a TV show or play a game.
* Short term memory is improved.
* Re-connected with friends/family members who don't smoke weed. It's easier to have spontaneous conversations and I feel like people are generally reacting to me better.
* Taking more walks during the day in pretty public parks enjoying the sun and people walking their dogs, rather than only at night to smoke in private.
* I feel more like myself; like who I was when I was young/before weed.

The bad:

So, for the reason you already know, this month I've been really depressed and struggling with daily functions. I had a week where I slept for 16+ hours every day. I started to think ""If I'm just sleeping and eating anyway, why don't I smoke?"" I made a post here about it and got some good support. Then hitting 3 months was kind of triggering; I felt like ""Haven't I proved enough? Isn't once every 3 months OK?""

I started thinking about weed a lot again, talking myself into relapsing and then talking myself out of it. That's the part of I'm sick of, thinking about weed all the time and letting it control my daily schedule.

I finally realized two things: one, what I remember about weed (the good times) isn't what I'll experience if I'm smoke again (I'll just be anxious and tired). Two, if I smoke once I'll be thinking about weed every day for like another month, and I really don't want that. So, I think I've accepted that 3 months is not an excuse to relapse. The urges are diminishing (for now at least).

OK, that's it. Thank you for reading. You can do this and it's so worth it!!!"
"One of the best things about weed, also one of the worst things about quitting. Daily smoker nearly 5 years. Have had a few failed attempts at stopping (longest being 6 weeks). I'm trying again and up to 5 days (God I wish that didn't feel like such a monumental success). 

Weed and smoking always allowed me to 'shrink' my world. To ignore external pressures, obligations, and irritations. My world went no further than me and my drug. This made it easily controllable and very comfortable.

As proven by the existence of this sub, weed is not a panacea, but it feels that way when you are so deeply enthralled by it. The easy, confrontationaless world I lived in was bliss, and I never needed to face any difficult reality while I was there.

Trouble is, when you quit, that world quickly begins to fade like the façade it is, and illuminates all the corners of life I had shut myself away from so willingly. That ""shrunken world"" I saw for years as my haven, is actually my prison, and it is killing me knowing how long I have inflicted that on myself."
"Quitting weed has given me my mornings back and it’s... sacred But even if you’re not a morning person, it applies because “leaving” gives you your TIME back.

I myself have always been a morning person, and waking up to do my routines, to settle into the world, is so important. 

This morning I woke a little after six, journaled, and went on a bike ride to the beach, got some groceries and made breakfast all before work. 

This NEVER would have happened in smoking days; I was perpetually groggy, unmotivated, sluggish, and no matter how much I slept I woke up tired. 

Good morning.

PS: for those who are curious, I’m at the three week mark on one of many attempts. For the first week I let myself sleep as much as possible; it seemed important to recuperating my energy."

"2 years weed free. I truly felt as though smoking weed, in particular dabs, really damaged my cognitive abilities.

I've never been a big drinker, but I've also drank very little over these past years too.

I'm here to say that it has slowly but surely come back to me. I may not be as fun at parties, but I am sharp as knife!

Theres always a chance to improve. There's no time like now.


Edit: Thanks everyone for the encouragement! 

I want you to know that I'm very proud of all of your efforts as well, even if this is your first day weed free."
"25 year smoker, all day, every day, 4 days sober and I just wanted to thank you all for being an inspiration. Let's go! "
"Quitting isn’t about giving something up, it’s about taking back the things you DESERVE! You deserve to not suffer from anxiety
You deserve to feel true happiness
You deserve to have meaningful relationships
You deserve to socialize with people
You deserve to have a clear mind
You deserve to spend your money more wisely
You deserve to not feel numb
You deserve to enjoy the little things
You deserve to make yourself, your family, and your friends proud

Don’t let THC take all of these things away for temporary pleasure, it’s not worth it. Let’s do this together brothers and sisters!"
"Don’t fall for you’re brain telling you life is boring and there’s nothing to do without weed. It’s you’re brain tricking you. After awhile without weed you gain real hobby’s and start to truly find yourself and live the life you love, if you know you can have it and strive towards it. For many of us here weed creates a problem that it also fixes and that becomes vicious cycle. Replace that bad habit with good ones like exercise and meditation.if anyone needs any advice feel free to pm me or comment here. Have a good day everyone"
"Enjoy life how weed taught you too. When you go to college you gain knowledge but you eventually graduate and leave. Same with weed, it taught you how to slow down and appreciate the here and now and enjoy the little things, but now it's setting you free to enjoy those things without the training wheels. Just because you stopped getting stoned doesn't mean you can't go through life with a stoned mindset."
It’s been a long sweaty week but I’m still going. Couldn’t have done it without this sub I know that. Thank you! 
"Cancer i hate you Hello all, i recently popped my reddit cherry on this Sub when i shared my story about being 7 years “grounded”. This week i found out my mother has stage iv ovarian cancer. I want nothing more than to show up to my neighbors house ( 98% sure he’s a dealer) and cop some flower. I want it so bad. I want to forget how i feel and abandon the reality that is my new normal. My mother is my rock, my strength, my guide out of the hell i was in so many years ago. 

I know this isn’t a Christian group or religious for that matter, but i have nothing left other than my faith. I ask you guys to keep my family in your prayers. Thanks for listening /leaves"
"For the lurkers, the dreamers, the smokers, the leavers I’ve been lurking this subreddit on and off for several months and I’d like to share my thoughts with you.

Let me tell you my story in a relatable and, perhaps, meaningful way. 

At first, I began smoking weed very rarely during social parties. I enjoyed it. It was euphoric. It was new. I entered a new perspective on myself whereby I felt I was carrying an internal conversation that helped discover new things about myself. 

Then I started smoking more frequently. Now the experience was still very enjoyable, but I was beginning to not enjoy experiences without it. However, I still continued to be a productive, relatively successful individual (respected occupation, fancy apartment, etc.). 

Then I started the vape pens. Those euphoric highs were extraordinary. I felt I was solving all the world’s problems in my head and then some. 

Then those close to me suspected I was on something because my personality had changed. Although I felt it hadn’t, they remarked that I was less connected and more dull. I had lost an edge that defined me. 

So I quit. 

Several times. 

First a couple of days. Then a week. Then a couple of days. And so on. 

It’s now been 30 days. 

I’ll tell you what’s happened. 

I’ve got my edge back. I’m sharper. More focused. I’m no longer escaping boredom, anxiety, or stress. I’m tackling them head on. I’m working out, losing weight, and studying again. It’s no coincidence. 

Most importantly, it’s not the streak of days that I’m no longer high that matters, but the streak of days that I am consistently myself. 

I post this because this story will be true for almost all of you. I wish you the best. Be your best. You owe it to you. The high is a lie."
"Today I am 6 years free from cannabis addiction, AMA Six years ago I couldn't imagine going a day without smoking. When my psychiatrist asked me to take a break for a week, I didn't make it more than two hours. I couldn't have imagined the life I'm living now, which I know I could not have built if I was still smoking. 

*Edit: Since I'm getting a lot of ""man"" in the comments I just want to add that I am in fact a woman. (No offence taken, just wanted to make note of it in case there are other women that might identify with my experience.)*

Last year I posted for my [5 Year Anniversary](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8q67dq/today_l_am_5_years_free_from_cannabis_addiction/) and decided to make it an annual tradition. There aren't a lot of people who understand the nature of this addiction, so sharing it with this community feels like an appropraite was to celebrate the milestole. You can also read I bit about my early story in my [Six Month AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1t4pmh/6_months_detailed_story_ama/). 

In the thread last year I noticed someone had asked for a timeline, so I thought I'd start with that and then see what questions you all have.

**2013**

"Smoking again won't bring you any knowledge you don't already have. You've smoked enough--the spiritual effect phase of weed use is short and after that you've got to use your own intuition. Hard and scary, but real."
"Everyone always told me this shit was not addictive. This is just ranting I’m sorry

Before I go on I’ll just say that out of the four years I have been smoking consistently, 3 has been mixed with tobacco, or “spin” as it’s called in Australia. 

My mood is entirely dependent if I have bud, it could be the worst of the worst bud and I would still find comfort in the fact I have something to chop up. I can not imagine a life without smoking bongs. I hate myself for not just being able to drop this substance. I have developed permanent hand tremors from the abuse, and if I go two days I skitz out with anger at small things and my anxiety is at an all time high. But funny thing is, the moment I smoke my anxiety also goes through the roof, I can leave my house whatsoever out of fear of something terrible happening. I want to quit it so I don’t fear the world anymore, but everything terrifies me when I’m off it. 

What a fucking situation I’ve gotten myself into."
"2 months in and those innocent joint thoughts emerge Aah, long week in the office? What an increidible feeling it would be to smoke a J on a weekend night and relax, watch a show with the girl, get some yummy food, hang with the pets, game on my PC....What harm could that possibly be?

A lot, I just have to type it out here to remind myself. That one Friday night J would turn into picking up tomorrow for saturday, teling myself I wont smoke sunday to “get ready for work” but I surely will... and if I dont smoke I would be wishing for it all day and not enjoy my day off..

It would lead to me wanted to sneak a little tobacco in that J to make a nice spliff, one of my brains favorite chemicals.

I would start eating worse, letting go of hobbies just to sit around and be high, everyday chores would be way more obnoxious because Im not stoned, my relationship with my gf would struggle because someone so amazing should never take a backseat to weed :(

Well that makes me feel glad that I quit, for all those reasons, I need to keep these reasons in mind.

Cheers to wherever yall are on your path"
"Just hit 3 months clean.. This quote someone posted really stuck with me It's like when someones using a vacuum cleaner for a long time, while you try to watch TV. You ignore it long enough and eventually you don't really notice. Until it finally stops.

I can assure you this is true and a love my new life without weed :)"
"8 Months Sober - Here's What I've Learned This is a long post, so I'm going to use bolding and TLDR's for the long sections to help make it more digestible. The sections are Intro, What I've Gained, What I've Lost, How I Did It, and TLDR.

**Intro:** I smoked daily for 8 years and struggled trying to quit from November 2016 to January 2019. It took me nearly 3 years to get 8 months sober. I swear if I can do it, you can do it too.

This community was soooo valuable in helping me quit, so I wanted to finally come back and share my experience. I hope you find it helpful.

**What I've Gained:** 

* Mental clarity
* Confidence 
* Self love
* Interacting with people is so much easier 
* I’m happier and more connected to the good parts of my life 
* Better relationships with my family and friends 
* I have more time 
* Less stress 
* Less sensitive/easily hurt
* More empathy
* Stable moods 
* The ability to face my negative emotions and hear what they need to tell me 
* The ability to face my positive emotions and truly experience them
* I can identify other problems in my life that need addressing 
* Sustained focus on developing myself, instead of trying things and not sticking with them 
* Better self-control 
* Better sleep
* More desire to socialize, less craving to self-isolate 

**TLDR: life is so much better and easier.** Not always easy, and not always great, but 8 months in, everything in my life has and continues to improve.

**What I've Lost:** Let's be honest, we wouldn't be here if we didn't love weed. We're the ones who love it too much. We love it so much we have to take it away from ourselves. So yeah, giving it up, there's going to be some loss.

For *years* I struggled with the idea of quitting \*forever\*. We've all experienced the fun, and, I believe genuinely beneficial aspects of getting stoned. 

**My hang-up in quitting/What I thought I'd really miss:** 

* Introspection and self-revelation 
* Awe-inspiring experiences with music, movies, and video games 
* Helping me get excited about my life 
* Do I really have to quit FOREVER?

Where am I at now?

**Introspection and self-revelation:** All that good stuff that bubbles up (usually only in like the first half hour) when you're high is actually bubbling up all the time. Smoking weed can send a lot of it up at once, and it makes you more interested, because your thoughts feel more profound, but you'll still have these realizations and insights into your life while sober, and your ability to integrate them increases greatly. I still miss this a bit, but nbd.

**Music, video games, movies:** I love that feeling of wonder, when you're singularly immersed in something. Some of my experiences with weed and music, movies, and video games were truly transcendent. But far, far more of my experiences  were desperately grasping for the feeling of wonder, not finding it, and ending up sorely disappointed.

That feeling of wonder comes from presence. Being fully present, and fully experiencing something. The good parts of being high did that to me. Gave me singular focus, plus a blast of feel-good chemicals. So where is the wonder? Is it in weed? No! It's within you. 

I find that singular focus and wonder in so many more things now. Music, movies, and video games still, for sure, but also in much quieter moments, just taking in my surroundings. The wonder is within us and without us, not in a bowl and a tv screen. Weed could help force that feeling. It could also make you grasp desperately at it for hours on end. Let it come to you.

**Getting excited about my life:** This is the one that's still hanging around. Weed has the ability, mostly before you totally abuse it, to take a random Tuesday night and make it feel exciting and special. To make me want to get on my computer and make a song, or excited to eat dinner, excited about whatever. I do find that excitement naturally, but honestly I do still miss being able to bottle that excitement and crack it open when I'm feeling sort of an ennui. That bottle came with a price, though, which is feeling wholly unmotivated and like you just can't even - and I do try to appreciate not paying that price. I tend to trust that my excitement for life will continue to improve over time.

**Quitting forever:** I don't think about it as much. Sure, it's possible I could have a healthy relationship with weed some day. I think like any drug, there's a type of usage where it can enhance your life at minimal cost. I abused alcohol in my late teen years, and for many years now I've had no problem enhancing my life with a drink or two with friends like once a month, without paying the cost of a hangover or full loss of faculties. 

It's possible I could get there with weed. But I don't worry about it as much these days. I haven't lost as much as I've thought I would, and I've gained so much. I want to protect that.

**TLDR: The things you'll miss about weed are an inherent part of life.** You come by all that good stuff far more often living clean and sober - it's just distributed more evenly throughout your life instead of concentrated into that perfect smoke sesh we've all been chasing.

**How I did it:**

I'll give a full list of things that helped, and then focus specifically on the things that were different this time that I actually quit, after years of struggling:

* Meditation
* Therapy
* Exercise
* Healthy Diet
* Reading r/Leaves
* Keep Trying

I did these things for years and never made it past 2 months. So what changed? Well a few things:

**Make an emergency plan:** By far the most important thing here. What's the difference between re-lapse and 8 months sober? Surviving a few of the strongest urges I've ever had to smoke. In 243 days sober, probably 230 of them were easy as pie, maybe 10 required some conviction, and 3 were borderline miraculous I didn't smoke.

I got so close to smoking those 3 days. What saved me? Knowing I'd face insanely strong urges, making a plan for when that happened, and following my plan. 

Whenever I got to the point where I was about to give up and smoke, I got on r/Leaves and read. I read and read, still thinking I was going to smoke, but instead of smoking I read. Eventually I'd stumble onto something that gave me the strength not to smoke, and I knew I'd made it past that craving. **This is what got me to 8 months sober. That was my plan. Make your own.**

**Re-commit to being sober every day, and give a reason it's important:** I started out hand-writing my commitment in a notebook every morning, and I did that for a month or two. Eventually I found the I am Sober app, and started doing it there, too, and eventually started doing just the app. I still do the app. Renew your commitment every day. Keep it strong.

**Talk about it with your friends:** My weed usage was such a shameful thing for me, and I kept it hidden for so long. Share your struggles with people - there's so much connection to be found in our shared struggles. People say the opposite of addiction is connection, and that feels true to me. Connect with others on this topic, connect with others in general, and don't be afraid to show this side of yourself. Just tread lightly at first, some people won't be ready to talk about it if they aren't ready to look at some related part of themselves.

**Call it what it is:** This has always been hard for me, but here it goes. I'm addicted to weed. My dad is an alcoholic, his dad was an alcoholic, my mom's dad was an alcoholic, and I'm addicted to weed. I had to realize it wasn't one bowl or one evening with nothing going on - it was addiction. One random night is no big deal, but addiction is a huge deal, and I had to re-frame and face up to it to deal with it.

**Mantras:** Any time I saw craving thoughts (thank you meditation for helping me see these) I would repeat a mantra for myself in response. I had a few, but one was ""I am an alcoholic, as was my father, as was his father before him."" It helped stop or slow that runaway train that starts with one random thought and leads to picking up pizza after work and getting super duper stoned.

**TLDR: Life is great sober.** Everything you love about getting high is still here, but better, and easier. If you're struggling, stay strong, love yourself, and keep on struggling. Make yourself a plan to beat this thing. You're worth it and the struggle is worth it. Read r/Leaves. It helps. Much love"
"This is really unpleasant. I know I'm just yelling into the ether, but damn does this suck.  About a couple weeks abstaining after years of daily use.  The insomnia, the dreams, and the emotional beating (anxiety and depression) are really bad.  When I can sleep I wake up in the morning feeling like I haven't slept at all.  It's like this constant mental and emotional beating.  I have no desire to use -- to be honest I don't even miss it -- but I just want to feel normal again already.  Ugh.  Thanks for reading; just typing this makes me feel better.

&#x200B;

EDIT to Update:  Thank you all.  Really.  Everything you have all said has been incredibly helpful, and just knowing that there are a bunch of people I've never met who give enough of a damn to comment and help a random stranger really helps -- the commonality and shared experience especially.  I was afraid, as a mid 40s dude having a rough time with this that I'd be an outlier.  I'm glad I'm not.  Just knowing it's going to clear up eventually makes it easier to suck up how it feels now.  I'm still exercising (going to hit it even harder), talking to a shrink, and I'm going to try a little melatonin at night.  Again, thank you all for the kind thoughts, advice, and inspiration."
"Been clean for a month even tho where i live weed is legal, there are two dealers in my apartment, a dispensary in front of me and my friends smoke It's been SO difficult and I never thought I would do it for the reasons I wrote but, I quit cold turkey and i am a month clean!! Used to be a cig smoker a few years ago and when I quit cigs it started to disgust the f out of me. Never smoked or touched a cig since then. And it started to happen the same with weed!! So happy"
"6 months. I'm speechless I never thought I would see the day where I could say ""I haven't smoked weed in 6 months"" but here we are. I've turned down weed that's been offered to me, I've been around people getting high, I even made brownies with my aunt (mainly because I love baking) and told her to keep them. Here's to another 6 months, and into the rest of my life without anything holding me back. 

To everyone still struggling, it's okay. It's a long hard road to recovery, but we can make it through this together. I say it on all my posts here but thank you all for your support through my battle. If it wasn't for this sub and all of the kind hearted people in it, I no doubt wouldn't have ever made it this far."
"A year sober and I’ve saved....$ $17,000. Yes, that’s how much I was spending on weed in a year. And that doesn’t include the Ubers I took because I felt too lazy to take the subway. That also doesn’t include the pricey delivery food I ordered because I was too high to cook (sometimes I’d pass out before it’d come and I wouldn’t even get the chance to eat it). 

I smoked for over ten years. That’s six figures. Up in smoke. 

Just another reason of many to be sober.

Edit: the number is not the point. I was dumb and reckless and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. My life was not sustainable and I was headed nowhere fast. That’s the point."
Day 1. It's 1/20 2020. I want to be a month free and off ganja on 02/20 2020! And I'm gonna make it happen this time. Send all the support possible I really need it this time. I'm gonna be 33 yo on 13th of May 2020. Need to get my s*it together till then. Group help with any advice possible. I'm serious and prepared this time. Bisous
"Reminder: If you have some, it's all I think about When I have weed, I just want to smoke it.  
If I wake up in the morning, it will niggle at me until I have it.  
If I don't smoke it before work, I rush through my whole day trying to get to it.  
If I do smoke before work, I'll need to smoke during work to maintain the high.  
If I have it at the weekends, I just worry about running out.  
If I have lots and lots stashed away, I worry that I have a problem, or may be getting more paranoid (often true).  
If I throw it away, I then wonder why I've done it.  
If I pick up more, I often wonder why I've done it.  
If I savour it, it's torture.  
If I chain smoke it, it's overwhelming.  

There is no enjoyable amount, or preferred time of smoking (for me).  

It's just an endless game that cannot be won.  

It's nice not having that extra baggage on my consciousness."
"I have this image in my head of what getting high will feel like. I really want it; but I know it's total bull. Quitting is a mourning process. When I think about getting high, I feel the exact same memory. Everything slows down, everything is so bright, my vision fishbowls back a little, I feel like my chest is rising a bit and I can't help but giggle. This is what getting high used to feel like for me, and it was very nice.

Everytime I've slipped up, it's been this tempting image that has caused it. Everytime I've slipped up, that has NOT been what happened. Not for a long time. Whenever I get high now, I feel shivery, anxious, dried out, tired. Panic attack and isolation. Huge regret.

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that correlates with our expectation of something good. Because weed is pretty much universally amazing when people start out, dopamine is naturally released when a smoker thinks about getting high. Even as the high starts to fade and suck everytime, the dopamine level is still high, making you expect that THIS TIME it will be fine.

I believe quitting smoking is a mourning process. Someone who has never been drug dependent/addicted would find that silly. But the truth is, addiction is connection to a substance to make up for a lack of real connection with others and the real world. Many of the same brain chemicals that make you love a person, and make you grieve when they are gone, are activated when you take a toke. Losing weed can be like losing a friend or a partner, as is evidenced by the way so many people personify marijuana when they say goodbye. 

What's tragic about addiction is that sometimes it can be even more confusing to accept than when your friend has died. If someone you love dies, that's very hard, but you also know that you can't change what has happened. When quitting smoking, you could theoretically bring Mary J back to life by relapsing. And then you have to watch her die again when you inevitably choose to quit once again. Rinse and repeat.

The good news about all this: quitting will almost guarantee you connect better with people around you. You can get long lasting, free, genuine natural highs and build up strong, helpful, healthy relationships at the exact same time. Really consider this. Is weed better than that? No. It's just easier and more comfortable. Dare to be brave.

This is a call to everyone thinking about smoking: Don't put yourself through that process over and over. Just mourn and watch as it gets easier. Humans are better at moving on from the loss of a friend or lover than you think, and the same will be true for quitting. Just have faith in yourself.

""The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection.""

Edit 1: clarity

Thanks everyone for the kind words. I really love whenever experiences can help others! Everything I said are things you already knew, we just need reminding when the cravings hit."
"Anyone else constantly feel you'd be better off stoned when you're sober, and sober when you're stoned? I'm just curious if anyone else struggles with something similar to this.

When I haven't been smoking I get anxious, overwhelmed, and have trouble doing things like sleeping, exercising regularly, and just generally relaxing and finding the beauty in the little things in my life. 

I occasionally reach a tipping point and buy some weed, and for while I experience a happy medium between the coherence of sobriety and the pleasure of enjoying my drug of choice. 

But usually within a week my self-control has lapsed to the point where I'm smoking multiple times a day, starting earlier and earlier in the day. It interferes with the things I want to get done; things as basic as holding a conversation on track and not losing my train of thought. I reach another tipping point here where I throw out the weed I have left, go cold turkey, and get my shit back together.

Theeenn a while later a stressful event or the accumulation of little things will convince me that I'd be so much happier and effective in the things I want to get done if I could just take the edge off once in a while with some weed. Cue the continuation of the cycle.

Anyone else have this kind of thing happen? If so, what are your go-to strategies to get out of this loop?

EDIT: You guys are great, it's comforting to know other people feel this way. I'm gonna come back to this post next time I feel like slipping up. I wish you all the brightest of pot-free futures."
"I've decided to give up weed. On this day, February 12th, I have finally decided to give it up. 

I am done with chasing that childhood sense of wonder. I realize that I am deeply nostalgic, and used weed to feel like a kid again. It's okay to grow up. I have finally confronted these feelings of mine.

It is much more beneficial for me to leave this drug in the past. 

**You either dream while you're awake, or while you're asleep. You choose.**

Goodbye.

((Edit: Wow, thanks for all the support you guys! I really appreciate it.))"
"PSA: If you’ve got a good streak going, breaking the seal makes temptation so much stronger! Took an edible after 7 months of no smoking 3 weeks ago. It was a fun time, not without some reminders of why I quit in the first place, but MAN the temptation to light up has been much more noticeable than before. 

It helped me realize that this whole journey is more than streaks but about the new habits and growth that comes about making changes, even if you can’t achieve A+ status every time. 

If you’re thinking about taking a dip in stoned waters after a long time without, just know that the slope is very slippery. I think about smoking quite a bit these days and when the temptation passes (it always does!!) I am very happy that I don’t cave. I’ve come too far to get caught up in this habit again...

Good luck y’all, I believe in you!"
"82 days without weed. Got a pretty good job by passing a drug test. I got accepted for a job working in the machine shop of a big tractor and lawnmower manufacturer. I passed my drug screen. It was the first time I have passed a drug test without hiding a bottle of fake pee between my legs, I'm feeling pretty proud about it.  I'm going to get benefits and everything!t
 I start in 2 weeks. It's my first big boy job!"
"ONE. MONTH. SOBER!!! It's been a massive struggle, I'm still having heaps of withdrawals and cravings, but I made it a whole 30 days and counting!"
My daily check in May 6. I will not get high today. 
"Day 5 - Rolled a joint at work party The title might be a little misleading; last night, at the work party, a couple of girls pulled out a bud and asked around if someone knew how to roll.

I rolled the J to a T; it was passed around. Never took a drag. Feel so good guys! Thanks to this sub for the support"
"“It's easier to keep a tiger in a cage than on a leash.” Once I've opened the cage, the whole day revolves around topping up just to feel normal. I can't moderate with any mind altering substance."
"4 days without smoking for the first time in 8 years Been a heavy smoker for about 8 years now. Always thought it was so stupid for people to say weed is bad for you or whatever. Lately though I’ve realized with help from my lovely fiancé that I’ve just been hiding from the world. All I care about is smoking weed and playing Xbox. I’ve realized that what the fuck are either of these things doing for me. I have nothing to show for being high or being good at video games. I know it’s only been 4 days, but I’m really trying this time and this subreddit has helped tremendously. Thanks you guys!"
"One month clean and turned down my first offer to get high. Surprisingly it was no real temptation. I ran into a friend and he slipped me his vape pen, and I didn’t even have to think about it.. I just told him no thanks, I quit. 

Honestly at this point Id probably go into a panic if I got high. My life is better without it. Im up early every morning, Im less moody, and I love saving the money and not having to chase down my old dealer once a month.

If you’re reading this and only a few days in, please don’t give up! Time will pass and you’ll get over it."
"Long story short. Decades of struggle. Don't wast your time like I did. Start smoking at 15 years old.

Smoking daily at 17.

Smoking heavily at 18.

Become depressed, unmotivated.

Quit smoking at 25.

Start smoking again at 31.

""Things will be different this time"".

End up smoking daily and heavily all over again.

Quit and relapse a million times.

Suffer like hell during withdrawals.

Heavy depression.

Manage to quit for 5 months and 9 months.

Both times start smoking again thinking that ""things will be different this time"".

End up smoking daily and heavily again.

Quit at 38. Sober for 19 months now. Life is good.

Do you really want to waste time like I did?"
"Goodbye, r/leaves. At first it was helpful to have peers going through the same mental hurdles in trying to separate from weed. Thank you for your openness and honesty. 

But now, you are my last remaining association to weed... and that is a good thing.

My final conclusion for you all: 

It was never the weed's fault. I still like weed. I appreciate the fun we had. I appreciate the friends I have made smoking together. But I **allow myself** to become complacent when I am high. I settle for less, and let myself think ""this is enough"". 

Success and personal growth are my new high. Thanks to recent clarity, I have doubled my income, got in great shape, and separated from the toxic people and behaviors that used to dominate my life. 

And who knows...
maybe one day down the road, I will be able to roll one up again under better circumstances when the time is right.

But until then,

cheers. "
"Day 370: So proud of myself I was perma-stoned for about 20 years of my life.  I smoked my way through so many milestones, but I finally woke up!

I even did it with legal weed all around me, including in my roommate's medicine cabinet.

I just wanted to brag, and also to say that if I could do it, you can too."
"I used to not be able to imagine life without weed... today I mark 150 days clean. Thank you so much to this sub for all the support, motivation, and inspiration. It’s been a long journey, filled with highs and lows, but I can say with confidence that I am far happier with the person I am today. 

I am in control of my thoughts and actions. I am living mindfully and actually accomplishing the things I want to. I realized I was an addict and I let that empower me every day as I live a sober yet fulfilled life. I wouldn’t want to be any different of a person. Own that shit. 

Leaving is hard, but we are all capable of it with the right mental framework and support. Don’t be afraid to ask for help, it might just change your life. 

Love you all and stay strong in these bizarre times."
"I want to look forward to LIFE not just getting high When I smoke daily, I find that it takes away or limits the pleasures of just eating food, watching a movie, socializing, because you’re thinking that it would be better if high instead of just enjoying what life has to offer. That’s one of the main reasons I quit. I want to look forward to and enjoy life as it is without any substances altering my perception. I want to be grateful and appreciative and feel genuine joy by my life experiences, not because I altered it with a plant to make it temporarily “better”."
I finally hit the 6 month mark! I never thought I could make it this far!! 
"Anyone else get crazy dreams after not smoking for a while? Once i stop smoking for a while i get these full blown vivid almost lucid dreams but they are crazy normally consisting of multiple people ive met in my life. Basically a load of weird shit happens. Im aware this is because weed doesnt allow you to enter REM sleep properly therefore not allowing your brain to dream. 

Personally i find these dreams very interesting but when i wake up im happy the dream isnt real because its so intense and sometimes i relapse because of the dreams being too much lol. 

Just wanted to know if anyone else experiences similar or the same thing."
"I don't like getting high, I only like the idea of getting high Hey guys, 10 years daily smoker and long time lurker here. I managed to stay sober for 2 months and just wanted to tell you what has changed since I quit. 

* I get sooo much more shit done. In my job, for example. When I smoked, I finished 1 or 2 tasks a week. Now I finish 5+ tasks easily. 
* I'm a much better partner to my girlfriend. Just an example: When I smoked, it was usually her who made dinner while I sat on the couch smoking and playing video games. Now we cook together or I do it while she can relax on the couch and I love it. (And she loves it.)
* I'm a much better friend to my friends. Before, when my friends went out to a bar, I usually stayed at home because I would rather be alone and smoke. Now I really like going out with them. In the first days after quitting I was afraid I would not like going out without weed, but I quickly realized that it's not hard at all. 
* I'm a much better son and brother to my family. When I smoked, I called my parents and siblings (I live across the country) maybe twice a month, sometimes less. Now I call them almost daily. 
* I'm in way better shape. When I smoked, my lungs started to hurt after 2 minutes on my bike, now they don't hurt at all. Also I really feel like doing something for my body (work out, go for a run etc.) When I smoked I didn't really care.
* I look better. I noticed that my eyes and teeth are cleaner and a lot of people told me I look „fresh“, woohoo!
* I drink less alcohol. I thought I would be drinking more in order to compensate the missing weed flash, but surprisingly I don't. 
* As I said in the title, I realized (even long before quitting) that I don't like being high, I only like the idea of being high. When I imagined lighting up a joint it seemed so cool and relaxing and even kinda romantic, but when I actually did it, it just felt like feeding my addiction.

For me, the only hard part were the first two days. After that, it became waaay easier. So if you're waiting for a sign: Here it is. Do it. It's worth it."
"A little trick that I use regularly to help with cravings (5 months clean). ""No, we don't do that anymore.""  


When my brain pops up and says ""Hey! let's smoke some weed!"" which is still somewhat frequent, I acknowledge that a certain part of me really wants to get high, but then treat it like a 5 year old who wants to eat ice-cream for breakfast.  I know he doesn't understand all the reasons why he can't have what he wants, so I keep it simple: ""No, we don't do that anymore."" We used to, but we don't anymore. Full stop.  Something about this mentality helps me let go of the craving, even if it's like a 5 year old saying ""Aw man! That sucks!""  That's right, 5 year old brain. That does suck. And also it's not happening, so move on.  Somehow, I move on every single time.  


The point is. Cravings are gonna show up. Remember that you are the adult here and that there are plenty of good reasons not to smoke, even if a certain part of you can't remember all of them. Make a hard rule and then make a part of you enforce it when the rest of you would rather not.  There's a ton of other techniques that I use to stay clean, but honestly, repeating the phrase ""We don't do that anymore"" seems to be the one that I use the most these days.  I recently quit nicotine, which is its own terrible addiction, and it's working for that too."
"The reason why you can't even smoke one hit - 16 days free What usually happens is that after a few weeks of not smoking weed, you start to feel confident again.

You don't feel cravings anymore, and you're forgetting how strong was weed's grip on your life.

You think to yourself that it is only one time, and what could go wrong?

&nbsp;

What people usually don't understand in this situation is that even after a few weeks or even a few months without using, your brain is still not the same as a non-smoker.

Your brain is the same as past user. And as past user, your brain still has strong connections between weed and happiness.

This is what caused your cravings, and when you give your brain THC once again after so long - you wake up all these strong connections that you have tried so hard to ignore.

Your brain's craving to THC will be once again full blown. You will no longer be able to concentrate on anything other than smoking weed again.

It takes weeks untill the intense feeling of craving weed will be manageable again.

&nbsp;

This is usually what makes people relapse most of the time.
I know from experience that my last 3 attempts to quit weed failed exactly because of that - confidence that came after a few weeks which lead to one hit.

And after that one hit you get back that need so bad that you start abusing weed again extremely fast.

&nbsp;

I believe that understanding this is the key to make my current attempt successful.

I am 16 days in, the cravings had stopped. I know that if I will smoke only once in about 6 months, maybe even in a year, the cravings that it will cause will be unbearable.

Rewiring your brain to not like weed hat much takes lots of TIME.

I am not going to risk it all anywhere in the near future - it simply does not worth it.

Hope that this information will help you too!"
"My List of Reasons to Not Smoke I really want to go buy a dab pen, but I'm reminding myself why I shouldn't:

1) it costs money

2) if I do it once, I'll want to do it all the time

3) my friends and family know I quit

4) bad for my lungs (especially given the outbreak of a respiratory illness!)

5) I'll accomplish nothing as soon as I get one

6) it will bring back that anxiety and emptiness that is impossible to fully understand sober

7) I'll be damaging my brain 

8) It conflicts with my medicine

9) I always end up watching shitty shows and feeling bored

10) staying sober is my 2020 resolution. I'll IMMEDIATELY regret breaking this good streak I've got going"
10 year toker. Quitting as my wife just found how she is pregnant. Title explains it. I’ve tried in the past and have failed. This is the real deal. I want to be present and engaged in my families life. Good luck to me
Day 14 we are forging a new life 
Does anyone else get super sweaty when they first quit cold turkey? 
"Thank you leaves for being, hands down, the most supportive sub I’ve ever experienced I imagine many ppl on this sub can relate to mental health struggles in some form. Whether it be addiction, anxiety, depression, or way more. During my time on reddit (and even off reddit) I’ve joined many different “support” subs for various things, and most claim to have the user’s best interest at heart and to be a “no hate zone”. Meanwhile, I’ve definitely witnessed and experienced first hand hate in many of those subs, despite looking for support. Today’s been a really rough day for me, not just bc mean reddit ppl but bc external life factors and COVID isolation and work stress and weed cravings. This has been a really rough year honestly, as I’m sure you all can relate. But despite all the pain and struggles, it warms my heart to know that I can turn to this sub for genuine support without fear of insult or shame. 

So thanks leaves and everyone reading this, you really are making a difference to others whether you realize it or not"
"dear weed thank you and god bless. you broke me in the loveliest, subtlest way. you sidled up next to me, held me by the hand and told me everything was all ok. you threw a smoke screen over the inferno that blazed and embered behind. you were my friend, my partner in crime. long days spent together. picnicking with you. watching trains with you. long walks with you. concerts in tandem. watching cartoons with you. by the firelight. you showed me lots of good music. 

i looked for you all the time. i longed for you every night. i missed you all the time. but you were always there! you were never too busy, or too important, or too complicated. my silent confidante. my trusted friend. you never left me. you never made me cry, and when you did, you were there to make it better. you never spoke but i knew you listened. you were my flame in a world of darkness. and just for a little while, you made me forget the loneliness that cannot be touched.


but we were selfish, you wanted me all to yourself. i wanted you to myself. you liked being alone with me. and i liked being alone with you. so much so that i found after a while i had fallen in love with you. and that was a time. until i found that life and others had passed me by because of it. nothing waits.


and it is with nothing but misery that you too made me realise all of this and that as lovely and loyal as you might be, i must go now and leave you behind or this fire’s gonna catch us both."
"After 8 years of daily use, a diagnosis of Cannabis Use Disorder, I guess I'm ready to change. Hi, I'm Glo, and I'm addicted to THC.

I started smoking weed as a teen with friends, sometimes skipping school to get high, but not often.  Then I got to college.  I started smoking more often, at least once or twice a week, still just with friends though.  Then came moving into my first apartment (shared with roommates) and all the freedom of living away from parents and off of school property.  I got myself my very own bong that year... and that's when everything started to change.

I began smoking daily, after work at first, then eventually in the morning before breakfast but hours before my nighttime work shifts.  When I was 22 I met my ex, D\*, and fell in love hard and fast.  He smelled of cannabis and coffee (we worked at starbucks together) and I loved it.  He was a weed dealer (back in the days before dispensaries were standard in Toronto) and smoked daily as well.  I was always high when we were together.  I started smoking at all times of day regardless of when I worked, and being high became my normal.

Two years later, D\* broke my heart, and I didn't want to feel anything.  I started smoking much higher THC levels and more often, I relied heavily on cannabis to numb my negative emotions. These emotions of mine are very intense, as I have Borderline Personality Depression and ADHD.  Being high made me less reactionary, less anxious, more... comfortable.

It's been 3 years since that breakup and despite multiple attempts at ""cutting back"" ""lowering my usage"" or ""quitting"".. I haven't been successful.

I am dependent. I spend all my time thinking about the next chance I'll have to smoke, I don't socialize unless I can be high, I don't allow myself to run out of weed even if it means going without groceries. I am terrified of the idea that I should quit for good and forever, but I know I can't go on like this.

I'm lonely. I'm lethargic. My memory is hard to access. I've no motivation to do anything other than smoking weed. I'm late for work often (a job I love!) because I just can't motivate myself to be on time for anything ever.  I've gained a LOT of weight and never have enough energy to exercise.  I'm numb and haven't cried in over a year despite experiencing sad and even traumatic events in that time.

I recently had a Psychiatric consult because I thought these struggles were linked to my medications (anti-depressant, mood stabiliser) and wanted to try a different medication for the first time since going on antidepressants. The psychiatric team I consulted with diagnosed me with Cannabis Use Disorder, and explained that due to the amount I've been smoking, every day, for years now, while my brain still developed and while I also struggle with BPD - that it has caused long term effects on my cognitive functions and mood.  They told me that it would be pointless to change my medication without me actually making a change in my cannabis consumption and addressing this addiction.

&#x200B;

So here I am. Going to an Addictions Clinic next Wednesday, looking for support here, and tomorrow night, I am going to go to my first Marijuana Anonymous meeting (very lucky that I live in Toronto and there are options every weekday here)  But I'm scared. I don't know what's coming. I don't know how to accept this new reality.  I don't know what to do to occupy my time as nothing seems to make me as happy as smoking weed does. Nothing calms my mind the way smoking does.

So there's my story, I'm taking the first steps towards quitting, and I'm terrified."
"Two years of freedom So it’s been almost 2 years of sobriety for me. Maybe my testimony will give someone hope out there. My life has improved to an extent I didn’t foresee. 


Two years ago I was living with my parents, working dead end minimum wage jobs, and saving no money at all. I was failing college, unhealthy, and completely unmotivated. Weed was legitimately the biggest barrier in my life. 


As soon as I quit I finally gained courage and motivation/drive to achieve things. Now I’m in a career I absolutely love, making more money than I even know how to spend, and living on my own with plenty of savings and am in the market about to buy a house by myself. Also, two years ago my main and only hobby was smoking. 

Now I’ve developed an intense passion for music, and am well on my way to learning guitar and piano. I’ve also really seriously fallen in love with fitness, primarily running and weightlifting and I’ve progressed much farther than I would’ve ever imagined I could. 

I could go on, and on about the improvements in life, but most important is that I have a constant level of peace in my heart and I really very very rarely go through bad times anymore. I’m not irritable, and I gain much enjoyment doing things I could have never imagined would’ve given me enjoyment. 

I’ve really fallen in love with life and my mind is immeasurably quicker and sharper. Every day I have an abundance of energy that allows me to very quickly move towards my goals. I know with 110% certainty that weed was my greatest inhibitor because everything started changing right when I freed myself from its grip."
"So I quit smoking weed on accident and I feel great. Been a lurker on this sub with no real intention to stop smoking. Was just nice to relate on some issues and enjoyed the camaraderie. But I would like to share my story, sorry it's a little long... Like I said I've been a lurker here and I've enjoyed many of your posts and saved a few of them and some comments I found very relatable and helpful. This is my first post or comment. 

I know part of me really just wants to keep smoking and act like it's not a problem. While it may not be the root of all my problems it doesn't help me like it use to. It use to only positively effect me, I was still happy and social even when I was high. It always made my body and mind feel good. It always felt right. That's definitely not the case anymore. Maybe it is the root of my problems. I know it's something I need to consider. 

I have been smoking since highschool and haven't ever stopped, it's been over ten years. That's crazy to think about how much time I've kept the habit up. Also since highschool I've smoked cigarettes, drank beer and liquor, have enjoyed a little share of hallucinogens and some rec drugs and have been able to let go of all of them at some point in my life. I smoked cigarettes since highschool, stopped cold turkey for one and half years and now enjoy one every now and then. I still enjoy a drink every now and then and admit I can go a little heavy when I do but it's not a craving or habitual, I can just drop it unlike weed which I've literally never let go of since I started and if I didn't have it everything sucked and I probably wouldn't feel like doing anything until I found some weed.

Anyway...

My dealer took a week off for the holidays and I didn't get enough to last me until he was open again. Smoked the last I had about a week ago and I was plotting to get some as soon as he was back. He's been back for a few days but I haven't gone to him. I feel great and actually beginning to feel a little proud of myself. I also have an insane amount of energy that's almost annoying haha but it's probably because I don't have anything to put my energy into.

I do want to be honest with everyone here and out of respect for people who actually have quit, I feel like I should admit that I have dry hit my pipe a few times and smoked resin. I don't want to lie and I hope it's alright that I still post this. I can't say enough how much I respect this sub and the people here. You all seem like very understanding and loving people. I'm sorry if what I'm posting isn't what this sub is meant for but I feel like this is the place I could come to and share my experience, and I just want to be one hundred percent honest and transparent. I'm sorry if I am in the wrong and I understand.
Even though I haven't technically stopped, I feel great. Work is better, I feel full of life again and I can express myself with much more ease. I think that's the best part. My wit and humour is strong again! It's great. I absolutely love making people laugh, it's a great natural high, it definitely hits that reward/pleasure spot in my head and it feels great haha

I do suffered from over anxiety and have a had a couple severe panic attacks to the point I thought I was having a seizure. I hope this change will help, it would be nice to be able to go into new social situations or be on an airplane and not worry I'm going shit and vomit all over myself from being anxious haha

Another reason I'm really excited about this change is because the relationship I'm in right now is struggling. I live with my girlfriend which we've done before and ended up going different ways. She also smokes but I feel like she smokes more because I'm around, she's not the best at finding it or amounts and prices. She wouldn't even really try to get any and I know she would honestly love it if I stopped smoking. There's a good chance we go our separate ways again at the end of our lease but I want to do this for the both of us. I know at the end of the day it should be about me and improvment for myself but if we do separate I want to leave each other better than when we got together again. 

I want to be that force of positive action for her. She's had a tough life and she's worked hard to improve it little by little with what she had, which was nothing. She's tired of being disappointed and I know I've contributed to that feeling. She feels like a failure and I want to be able to change that idea that we have failed. I want to be a partner who's ready to live a full life and really share some experiences with each other and not just float/coast through life which is all I've been doing. I want to be a source of positivity, of motivation and I want to inspire her and everyone I come across be their best, to care, to try, to better yourself even in the smallest ways. Push yourself to be that great person you already are. There's nothing you need to add to become a better person, you just need to pull it from within yourself, and become the master of your own seas. I would appreciate any support you have on my journey to mastering the sometimes rough seas and let's help each other to calmer waters.

Thank You for reading

I Appreciate and Love all of You

Edit: Wow. Thank all of you so so much. I'm honestly in tears right now because I have all of you at my back just like that. You are all so amazing. I'll admit for some reason I'm scared to fully commiting to quiting and I think it's because part of me doesn't think I actually can. But what I do know because of all of you is that I am on the right track. Failing is not what I want to do but it happens and we get back up and fight another day. I've always been a fighter but I was honestly at my limit. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for giving me hope and strength again. I will remain a regular here and pass forward the love and support I have gotten from all of you.

 I have a friend who says water is life, life is love and gratitude. So life is two parts gratitude and one part love. H2O. Some hippy shit but thank you, thank you, I love you all.

One last thing, I just commented on another post here about anxiety and I would like to share. It's not really a fight, it shouldn't be a battle. Give your problems space to be. The more space you give them the more clear they become to be. The clearer they are the more you understand yourself and you can tame and even 'conquer' it. But it's not a battle, the more I fought the less I had control over myself. You can't out think your problems. It takes strong will, surrendering to the things you have no power over and action over the ones you do. I've honestly always loved the serenity prayer which is similar even though I'm not religious because it captures that perfectly.

Thanks again everyone, I feel like I'll sleep pretty good tonight even without a smoke. I hope the same for everyone else. 

See you around friends! Peace and love ☺️"
"Just checked how many since last time with Mary jane, literally teared up at the number 176. Longest time away since I started 14 years ago. "
"100 days 🤩💪💰 Day 100 sober, after 22 years in the weed treadmill!

It hasn’t been a easy climb guys/girls, but i Can promiss you all , it’s so worth it!
Oh my god, i wish i’ve done this years before, instead of sitting and thinking about, how it would be like, not being addictet to this stuff, fantasiesing about what i could accomplish if my head wasn’t all fogged up!?

I Can garantie you all, now im about to finding out ecxactly, what i Can do in this one and only one life!

Tommorow i’ve been setup, from an former co-worker, to give my old boss a Call, because they miss me, and the good work i always contributet with, and they’ve heard about my progress!
It’s the best job i’ve ever had, so this is huge for me and my family,, i feel blessed to get a second chance. 

This is my gamechanger, a chance for a Hole new and better life, came a long with quitting once and for all!

Never going back to that shit, it has impacted my life in ways, that i never dreamt of while goofin arround the first couple years of using it!

Stop it, before you go Down the road, with anxiety, depression, lack of sleep, lying for anybody arround you, just to get that next hit, the one you foul the most, is you self!

It’s never and option again, never guys.

I wish you all the best, and keep up the spirit, the better life is waiting for all of you strong leavers!

100 days is a very small investment, in rest of you life.


Best of luck with your journey

Love from Denmark"
"The idea of smoking and being high is much better than actually being high. For those of you still in the process of quitting, I encourage you to try and notice exactly how you feel next time you get high. This has helped me tremendously in realizing that I don't need weed in my life. Next time you smoke, just spend 30 second or a minute just thinking exactly about how you feel right now, and why it something that you enjoy. After many times of examining myself while stoned I realized that it kinda sucks. You're ability to socialize with other people is extremely diminished, your desire to do anything productive is gone, eating healthy foods no longer does it for you, the euphoria the you feel is often very mild and extremely short lasting followed by a tiresome haze, etc. Each person will have their own reasons and need to notice it for themselves. So for anyone out there still trying to quit give this a try."
"I stood up for myself. Today I was at friend's place, I told her about what I'm going through at the moment and how tough it is to quit. I then left for an hour and when I came back there was a guy smoking a big joint in the living room.

I didn't say anything because he was more of a guest than I was (I often stay at that friend's place), they were both high. Then we had dinner and I was feeling really bad. During that time I felt high without smoking, passive smoke I guess.

Once dinner was over I asked my friend if I could talk to her in private, I was panicking because I have been avoiding situations like these so that I wouldn't be tempted to smoke again.

I told her I had to leave because the situation was really difficult for me, I couldn't cope with it. So I packed my things and left. I felt really bad about it and guilty, like I was a drama queen for leaving like this.. but now that I'm home I feel good that I stood up for myself and didn't stay there.

*English is not my native language I do apologise if I made mistakes*"
"I don’t think keeping track how many days sober is a great idea. I know it may feel good to say 10,18,42,85 days but I think it can add unwanted stress/anxiety.  Because really you’re focusing on days without.  

For me it’s a lifestyle change.  I don’t know how many days it’s been now and don’t really care.  

What’s most important is weed and its negative effects on my life are gone.  I’m focused more on my quality of life now and that has no number."
Day # 600 that I've had my life back. Surreal. Hugely thanks to r/leaves. 
"I don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to get water due to cotton mouth. I don't eat unhealthy foods due to the munchies. I don't think there's a ghost in my room due to paranoia. I have more money in my account. My breath doesn't stink. And my room doesn't smell like weed anymore. Also, I don't waste hours sitting on my ass watching sex and the city. I actually went on a walk with my dogs and I aced my astronomy exam. Life's good when I'm not a slave to my habits! A little over a week after falling off the wagon for months! Praise Jesus!"
"Stopping weed make me realize I have low self-esteem Title says it all.

Been smoking for 12 years, daily unless I'm on vacation or some special circumstance. My mental health was ok until the last couple of years. But I would smoke to forget my problems, and to make myself feel good without having to accomplish any of my goals, and to daydream that one day (just around the corner) I'd be some big-shot who everybody loved.

Well after trying to quit and lasting 3 weeks, I realize that I do indeed have low self-esteem. Basically I am full of self-doubts, I am constantly judging myself against others negatively (like judging myself against geniuses and olympians... jeezuz...), and I talk down to myself saying I am just lacking something. Just the regular 'I'm not good enough' thoughts. And I have discovered the roots in my childhood and upbringing (never being complimented, never being praised when I did well, etc).

(textbook relapse too.... buying a little bit of weed everyday and smoking it all as ""this is my last time!!""... then doing it all again the next day)

So I am getting therapy because I need it for sure.... but yea, I suspect a lot of people on here also are suffering from low self esteem and smoke to forget, because that's what I did. Well I hope you can get past it. I hope I can get past it, with regular work on my part I know I can. I don't care if it takes 10 years, I will be a better me.

Stopping smoking has had all these negative thoughts flood back into my mind. And it's long overdue. So I guess I gotta pay my dues and put in my work on myself. All the time I spend smoking, years of my life, was spent to forget myself. Well now I must look clearly and work on myself, so I can improve what I don't like. I am in control of my life now, not the weed."
"How to live without weed ? I have been smoking for so long. Im 31 now and started at 15. Pretty much my whole adult life. I have been doing it so long I cannot remember how to live without weed. My whole life has been shaped by it, I need it to have fun and relax but I am also antisocial on it.

I need it to play my guitar, to play pc games, to have deep conversations with myself and others. But nowadays I just dont feel good when I smoke because of anxiety. Its so scary to quit because I dont know what I would do without it but I cant live like this anymore.

It used to be a crutch for me and ultimately I think it is what stopped me from figuring out how to be my best self. Its weird because only when I am high will I have these toughts. Getting home from work sober I wont even think twice about not smoking.

The sober me wants to smoke for relief. High me wants to quit for relief. I cannot ever get it and it is really scary. I'll pick up my guitar sober and it sounds so bad.  I'll boot up a game and quit after 5 minutes. And worst, when I toke up I am so antisocial I will not even respond to text from my friends. I have lost good friends this way. I have lost the ability to have casual conversations since all I did for the last 10 years is get home and smoke. 

I want to have a normal life.  But my mind has been so rotten from weed abuse for so long I cannot remember how to live without it.

&#x200B;

What are some tips that helped you ? How long am I gonna feel this way ? Will I ever be able to live a normal human life ?"
"Don't quit quitting Hey everyone, I'm a fairly well recovered stoner. I was high pretty much 24/7 for 5 years, from when I was 19 years old. I quit the daily habit in January 2017, with a few minor relapses since. 

This sub is great, and I really love the support here. I wanted to add some personal advice, it may work for you, it may not. If you're struggling I'd encourage you to read ahead. 

Here's the gist of why I managed to quit: it was a fucking *long* process. Quitting for me wasn't a case of just deciding one day to go cold turkey. That flat out did not work for me. Like many of you here, I wanted to quit for a seriously long time before I actually did. I hated myself for ages even though I kept reaching for the green. ""I'll do it tomorrow, I'll finish this bag first, I'll do it after the party on the weekend."" Like having to break up with someone, there was simply never going to be a good time to do it. 

It took a six week trip to Europe for me to hit the reset button, cause I was too chicken shit to buy drugs in a foreign country (except Amsterdam). The sobriety I had was... liberating. Life was so much clearer. It helped that I was on holidays, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to do what I did if you're at home. 

My point is, it's not like everything just changed for me when I quit. I still had my old habits. My addict brain still had cravings (still does, to this very day). And I slipped, more times than I can count. But you know what? Quitting is like any other habit: it gets easier the more you do it. Maybe counting the days works for you, and if it does, I don't want to take that away. But so many of you on this sub seem to obsess on day counting. My advice? Just one day at a time. That's your focus right now. Day 4, day 15, day 57, doesn't matter. What matters is that you're sober today. 

If you slip, you slip. Don't use this as an excuse to smoke tonight. But similarly, don't use it to beat the living piss out of yourself if you relapse either, because I can guarantee you that hating on yourself is the surest and fastest way to impeding your progress. 

TL;DR, quitting ain't a light-switch. It's a muscle. Try hard and try often, and persist in your goal. You'll get there eventually."
I used to drive to this spot and smoke. Now I bike here and read 
"Hello there🙄 5 days in after almost daily usage for around 6 years and on and off several times a week for around 30 years.

Could use a little thumbs up to get me to a week.

"
1 year no weed !! I made it to a year without weed. I have started to drink wine though.. a bit to much now i gained a ton of weight. Going to put that down next
"3 days in and realizing a LOT of shit. For years I've been THE weedman for my group of so-called ""friends"", but as I've sat here alone for days without anyone outside my immediate family wondering where I am, if I'm okay I've learned that a shitton of the people I know just use me for weed or access to other narcotics. I'm taking a stand, today. This isn't the first time I've tried to quit, and I do have a problem. Especially with THC cartridges. I have no self control, but this drug has a grip on me like no other. I've quit cocaine, heroin, and I used to be a heavy MDMA user. But nothing has a hold on me like ol' Mary Jane.

&#x200B;

I'm going to a meeting tonight, thanks for being here guys.

TL;DR: Another plug off the streets :)"
"One. Year. Free. 2 days ago, on June 13, 2020 marked my 1 year weed and other subtance-free. 

I spent more than 5h browsing this forum with people having the same difficulty as I had when I stopped smoking weed. I stopped because of a panic attack when I was high. 

The first 6 months were the most difficult of my entire life. The first 3 the most horrendous. But, everything was a downhill after that.

I experienced extreme anxiety, panics, fear, weight gain and thousands of unpleasantnesses. I went to psychotherapy because of my anxiety. I started working out because of my weight gain. I started getting out of my comfort zone because of my fear and I started to enjoy life rather than smoking weed every night.

I do not regret it. It made me better. I didn't know who I was, what my limits were and what I was capable to do before I stopped smoking. I was always picked by others as ""the lazy one"". Turns out I'm not a lazy guy. Turns out I can get the job done and I can wake up early. After I stopped, my life was back on track. I sleep now better. I eat better. My emotions are under control. I remember things.

To whomever this is relatable, please try to stop and please understand that every emotion you feel, is temporary. Please go through my Reddit profile and check what I have posted and commented. You can notice my anxiety in the comments I've left and threads I have created. 

Life is worth living with your eyes open and mind cleared. Weed does not help. Weed does not define you.

Love you all.
Love /leaves.

"It's been two months without weed and I'm still thinking about weed. First I need to say that the abstinence I felt before is completely gone, it must have lasted a week, but I thought that soon it passed soon I would forget, but two months have passed and it keeps coming back to my mind, I am almost unconsciously looking for an excuse to buy and use again. Today is my birthday and I have been thinking about buying to ""celebrate"" it the whole week, but I know that if I do all that desire I had will come back again, and I don't want that at all.                                                                                                                    

I wish the day that this drug would vanish completely of my mind and I could live normally, but I don't think it will.

  
Thanks for reading."
"r/leaves and Sober October... Hi all!

Since we're seeing a whole bunch of new visitors as a result of Sober October (welcome!) I wanted to clarify our policy, as we will be modding out some posts and comments related to Sober October.

Sober October is about taking a break for a month.  Taking a break to reset your tolerance or re-evaluate your relationship with smoking are all great things to do, but we are a narrowly focused sub for people who have made the difficult decision that they have to stop for good.

As a result, unless you make clear that you are using Sober October as your Day 1 to a cannabis-free life, we'll be taking out Sober October posts.

As I say, breaks are great if that's what you want, but it's just not what we do.

The good news is that there's a terrific group for support with taking breaks and managing moderation called r/Petioles.  They can help you make Sober October a success, and when Halloween comes around and you decide it's actually time to quit for good, then you'll always be welcome back to r/leaves.

Good luck with whatever path you decide to take!

"Got in a fight with my wife, lost my work badge, had a panic attack, didn’t smoke. That’s pretty much it. My wife and I are quitting together so arguments come up that shouldn’t and they last longer than they should, then we get out of my car and my badge isn’t where it should be, I spiraled hard, like sitting in the dark alone for 10 minutes and going mute, all I could think about was smoking, but from posts on this sub, I learned to argue with the devil on my shoulder, rephrase my thoughts to say “I’m glad I’m not doing the thing I know is hurting me” and etc. I didn’t smoke guys. I made it to day 3 for the first time since college and I’m so proud of myself right now. Gonna go to a matinee movie his morning and see how awesome movies are when you’re all the way there.

Love this sub, don’t know if I could do it without you guys."
"Weed is harmless for some, but for the addict it is a terrible life-stealer. Weed can be insidious precisely because it seems so harmless. And, sadly, the recent societal acceptance of its use only reinforces this false perception. It makes quitting very difficult for those of us who really need to stay off it for the rest of our lives. ‘It’s just a little weed, what’s the big deal?’ is constantly playing in our heads, tempting us back to it.  And what makes it even harder is that, for most people, weed is really perfectly ok when done in moderation. 

But for those of us who tend to abuse it, weed is as dangerous as any drug can be to living a truly full life. While the danger is not that weed could kill us, the fact that it is not deadly only makes it less likely that we will ever quit. Meanwhile, its non-deadly effects slowly steal our life away by putting life on fast-forward and distracting our minds from very achievable and important goals.

I’ve been clean for about 6 months after a 27-year habit. The most powerful perception that has kept me sober is realizing how much time I wasted chasing the weed high. That meaningless, fiendish chase blocked me from chasing and achieving so many positive things in my life. That chase robbed me of even solid memories of the few things I did achieve. It’s all a blur. Weed speeds up time. That’s what it does, especially when you abuse it.

If you are a weed addict, you should quit just so you can live and savor true life and not just some fleeting high. Quit so you won’t miss out on all that life has to offer. Quit because, if you continue abusing weed, one day you will wake up old and tired (in no time) wondering with great sadness where all that time went.  That is the ultimate injury of each so-called great high that weed provides us addicts. At the end of that road is nothing but a wasted life and deep regret for what you could have been without a substance that made you artificially happy no matter how little you accomplished. 
"
Hello fellow sobers. Anyone else noticed how vivid your dreams are becoming? Or is it just me? 
"You have already survived the worst day of your life. What is the discomfort you are feeling right now compared to that? Right now you are making your way towards freedom and a better life, to not be addicted, and to live as your true self. This is just a temporary moment in time where you go through withdrawals and cravings. How often have you regretted a day of being sober? How often have you regretted smoking, when you actually didn't have to and you only realise it as soon as you are high again? Right now, all the discomfort you are experiencing come from weed, not your sobriety.

Once your body deals with the remnants of the plant, and once you let go of the bad habit you are clearly wanting to let go, you won't feel so uncomfortable. When you fight in your head about ""to smoke or not to smoke"" it is draining. Your body and mind may say that you would feel better right now, if you just smoked a little.

While that may be true, you would know it doesn't last forever. Sooner or later, you will be faced with this discomfort again, so why not now? Why wait and postpone your freedom? Why feel the same suffering over and over again, before you have the courage to stay still through the cravings? You have the power to quit at any time, you are stronger than your emotions. You have the power of your free will, and while the habits and addiction patterns in your brain tells you to smoke, you can just be. They won't make you do anything, it's only when you keep fighting them and you are tired from fighting that you give in, it's always your power, it always will be. Everytime you decide NO, that thought of wanting to smoke loses some of its power. After awhile, it doesn't take much to say no, because that pathway in your brain is dying out, slowly but surely.

You'll get dreams of smoking, glorified thoughts of good times when you smoke, and idealisation of being high when you quit, that is normal. Don't be scared of the thoughts. When you notice you tense up, you can for example just sit a few minutes and feel everything in your body. Follow your breath and notice you are fine. Even if you feel like shit at the moment, you are alive, there's nothing to worry about. It will get better, IT WILL GET BETTER. Don't lose sight of what you want, don't give into fear.

Keep going my fellow leaves. Even when it's hard, it just strengthens you. Be proud of yourself even when you get the smallest time off. Don't blame yourself when you are learning, everyday is a new opportunity to learn, you haven't thrown everything away when you relapsed after a streak. You can learn from your failures.

For me it is currently day 14, and while I still feel like I'm recovering, I don't feel nearly as bad as the first 1-10 days. I get thoughts of smoking, but I know it isn't worth it so I'll keep going and I keep telling myself I'm still recovering. Sleep is getting better and that feels good, still it isn't a reason to smoke the tiniest bit. I've already experienced being addicted, it isn't fun, and I'm tired of fooling myself and keeping myself from achieving things that I want because I'm afraid, and it's easier to fall back to the reason of being high, and post-poning things.

I wish all the best to you.

Edit: I wanted to add this quote I posted sometime earlier in a comment:

***We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline, or the pain of regret.***

***The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.***"
"Heavy smoker for 3 years. I just made it a month clean. I used to go through an 1/8 every 2-3 days. I would smoke when I woke up, before work, as soon as I got home, before every meal, right before bed, and even in the middle of the night if I woke up so I could fall back “asleep.” I would carry a vape pen with me so I could smoke if I was away from home, even during my lunch breaks at work. I was basically high all the time. 

Beginning of July, I went cold turkey and gave it all up. I didn’t like the person I became and it wasn’t the person I wanted to be. 

The first few days were hard. Sleeping was almost impossible and I didn’t have an appetite, but I persisted. It got better after the first week and I began having dreams again when I slept. My appetite struggled for a bit but now I’m eating fine. 

I kept myself busy so I wouldn’t relapse. I joined a rock climbing gym and began being social again. Weed kept me contempt being home locked in my room alone. Now I’m excited to get out of the house. 
The biggest change I’ve noticed is time doesn’t fly for me now. The past three years felt like a quick blur, this past month has felt like an eternity. It’s only been 31 days but I feel like I’ve lived more in that time then the three years being high. 

I’m thankful for this sub and everyone’s inspiring  story’s. Reading what other people are going through and seeing that they could do it helped me not relapse and push through. 

I know you can do it too."
Yesterday I celebrated my birthday without weed for the first time in 9 years. 
"My dealer literally sent me a massage and asked why hasn't he heard from me lately, i told him i still have the weed i bought last time, but the truth is, i allready throw that shit , and I'm not planning on buying again. "
"Tomorrow will be my first birthday in 8 years that I’m not going to be high. I’m turning 23 tomorrow and I’ve been smoking since 14.  The last 6 years very heavily and after quitting on may 1st tomorrow will be officially 14 days clean. I feel my natural dopamine levels returning, my happiness is increasing, and I just got a job after searching for 8 months after graduating college. This is it ladies and gents, life is getting better already. Thank you for this sub for pushing me to get rolling and my super supportive girlfriend who makes life worth living not high.  It gets better."
"I threw away all of my weed today I have been masking depression with weed and have been high every day of this quarantine. I couldn't do anything without smoking first. I gained probably 10 pounds, didn't keep up with studies and have honestly been worthless. I fooled myself into thinking I had moderation and that I could quit at any time. When I realized that this wasn't the case, I knew I was addicted.

But there is good news! I doused my weed with cleaner so I couldn't change my mind and threw it away. The next few days will be hard, but I will come out better on the other side. I have read through this subreddit often, and really appreciate the stories shared. I don't have a community because I live alone during this quarantine so having this outlet to see other stories has been amazing."
"This is my first birthday in a decade not waking up and smoking weed I was 24 years old when I smoked my first bit of weed and it only got worse from there, but I quit 25 days ago and it's been going strong. This is the longest I've gone without smoking, and this community has been a real help in achieving that goal. Thank you all and have a great weed-free day!"
"500 days Today is exactly 500 days since quitting weed! I still can't quite believe I actually did it and stuck to it. I have also quit nicotine since then too. Just wanted to say to anyone who is struggling in the early stages of quitting to keep at it. DO NOT GIVE UP. A sober life free from weed is completley worth the initial struggle.

EDIT: For context I smoked daily for about 12 years before quitting - between a quarter and a half ounce per week and quit cold turkey"
"I promised myself I'd only smoke at the weekend. Now, once again, I can't go a day without it. No more, starting today. This may be a familiar story. We tell ourselves ""Weed isn't THAT bad, there are much worse things I could be doing. I'll just do it occasionally and it'll be fine""

Then, you have a stressful day at work ""Well, I suppose I could treat myself""

Then you get ill ""Well, I may as well get high since I'll be in bed all day anyway""

And all of a sudden you've been smoking daily for 2 weeks without even realising it. Since the Covid-19 quarantine I'd fallen into the particular trap of ""treating myself"" because of the scary and stressful situation I found myself in.

Well now it's time to treat myself to some clear-headedness. Time to get my motivation back.

I wanna say a big thank you to everyone here for the inspiring posts I've read here and the general sense of community this sub provides. This is my Day 1. Wish me luck!"
"6 months sober I can’t believe I’m saying this shit. It’s been amazing. After 6-7 years of living the same day, I’ve finally made it out. 

Energy levels restored. I’ve been working out like crazy and saving up my money. The beginning was tough but my appetite is finally back to normal. No trouble sleeping. I really had a huge budget for pot and never for anything else. I’m able to treat myself with nice things now.  It feels great. My relationships with people have gotten better and I’ve somewhat busted out of my introverted ways. No more ups and downs with my mentality (for the most part)

Everything seems like its on a clear plane, an even line of vision. No more weird bouts of paranoia. My desire to burn has gone up in smoke. I don’t feel the want to go back to the lifestyle. 

6 months might not seem like a lot, but after 7 damn years of daily, hourly smoking, it feels like quite the accomplishment.

We’re in this together. Try your best to make the change if you feel trapped. Good luck to everyone!"
"I’m a sucker for instant gratification and weed is the lynchpin I overeat. I procrastinate. I lay around. I am a porn addict. I can spend crazy amounts of time on my phone. I have bouts of alcoholism. I am just a complete fiend for stimulation at my core, and really, it’s been that way as long as I can remember. Weed just made it all way worse.

Whenever I remove weed from the equation, I gain momentum with abstaining from the rest of my vices. The other habits fall like a house of cards.

It is so illogical that I keep falling into this trap. I’m so tired of it. I don’t enjoy smoking weed anymore, but whenever I abstain for a little bit (a week, if I’m on a *good* streak), it always just feels like something’s missing. I let my guard down, take a toke, and fall right back to square one. It’s incredible the mental gymnastics it takes to convince myself it’ll be “just once,” and it inevitably never is. But for some reason, I am discontent to some extent in either stage.

What’s really sad is that weed is like really bad now. I’m pretty sure I’m allergic from the reaction my body has to it. I don’t know why anyone likes hanging out with me when I’m high, because I just shut off. I become this zombified fiend. Nine times out of ten, I’ll be miserable and immediately wish I was sober. Somehow, I convince myself it won’t be that way though.

Well, no time like the present to try again. I can’t concede to the idea that I can’t do it, because that isn’t true. I just need to try harder, and be honest with myself about how hard I am trying, and remind myself how terrible I always feel when I slip.

Thanks for reading if anyone bothered to read all that. Would appreciate pointers."
"1 week off weed, 1 month without cigarettes, 2 months without alcohol.. feels good man. also 3 weeks nofap, started meditating, depression and anxiety slowly but surely fading away, im finally starting to see purpose in my life."
"Suffering by Comparison-- the Illusion of Weed I think for many people, it can be difficult to come to the understanding that they are better without weed. It's become so mainstream and pervasive in culture. There are tons of myths and misconceptions about it, mostly about how harmless it is. Who hasn't heard someone rant about why weed should be legal or how it's not as bad as alcohol, as if it's a novel point?

Also, weed, as many have pointed out, doesn't usually ruin lives. You can be high 24/7 and still make the case that you're life is fine. It's somehow become acceptable to be high all the time, yet it someone gets drunk every night they are an alcoholic?

This, combined with the fact that weed generally enhances any experience, causes us to be weary of the idea that being sober is better. I read in an article, ""How can weed be bad if it's good?"" 

The fact that weed is good IS the reason it's bad. It is a form of pleasure that is incredibly accessible and powerful. At first, weed will just make other pleasure more intense, like hanging with friends or going into nature. Over time though, it just becomes an act of desperation, melting into your couch, watching mediocre sitcoms, and eating junk food.

Even though what I described above doesn't sound all that great, and it really isn't, for a stoner it's the best thing they have. Weed take precedence over other pleasures. It's a sad but very true fact. If you smoke all the time, you will simply be less interested in connecting socially. You won't feel the same about your hobbies. Everything you once enjoyed will suffer by comparison to the extreme pleasure of smoking. The mundane, everyday drill of life will lose any of the excitement and novelty it had. You'll just be angrily trudging through the mud until you finally find relief, getting high at home. And even that starts to suffer by comparison to the 'old days' when you first started smoking.

So when you're trying to quit, and after a while the whispers in your ear try to convince you that, ""your relationship with weed wasn't really all that bad,"" just remember that it was. You quit for a reason.


Understanding the above has helped keep me from relapsing. I try to remember Albert Einstein's definition of insanity, which is: to try something over and over again, expecting different results."
"One Year Hey everyone. Tomorrow will be one entire year without smoking after ten years of daily use. I see there are many new members. I joined a little over a year ago and this community really helped me with my decision. I just wanted to thank all of you. The withdrawals and then the boredom were rough for a couple of months, but now it’s almost like I don’t think about it anymore at all. I turned my smoking time into reading time, and that really helped me get through the tougher times of quitting. 

Overall, I’d say my mental health has improved. I went up to a healthy weight as I was frail and couldn’t eat if I wasn’t high. I feel sharp and like a weight is off of me, and I feel clarity, like I am in control of my life. I have been going to therapy regularly and have been managing and working through my anxiety, PTSD, and depression in healthy ways instead of escaping like I always did with smoking. My grandfather was a longtime smoker as well, and lately he told me that “You are the captain of the starship.. to think anything in your life is in control is resigning your responsibility to yourself”, and I wanted to pass that to you guys. 

I’m hope someone sees this and it helps them keep pushing forward. Big love to you all."
One of the cool side effects of leaving pot behind is remembering your dreams when you wake up in the morning 
"As if dreaming again on its own wasn't cool enough, this was a nice realization this morning (day 5) "
"Day 33. After kicking daily the THC Demon's ass, he finally left my mental jail. I no longer desire weed. That need is gone. PAWS are hitting, daily dabber for 5+ years, and daily bong smoker for 10 years more before banging, but I don't want weed to ease them anymore. I started training hard again and I just registered for a Half Ironman competition. I'm fucking happy. Just wanted to share my happiness with you. Love you all."
"Day 3: I did not toke My roommate came in and dropped off a cart he got and said to take some of I wanted. I was in the middle of a game but I felt my brain immediately get excited. I even considered it for a moment. But I’m on day 3 of my second attempt, and I did. not. toke."
"Instead of shaming yourself, try this: Came across this today & thought it could help the community

INSTEAD OF:


It's bad (I'm bad) that I need drugs to feel better.

TRY:


It's extremely resourceful that my nervous system has found something to regulate itself. I wonder what else I could utilize that's inside myself and would make me feel better in the long run?"
"Instead of Smoking myself to sleep, I read On day 20. 

Last night, I hung out with a bigger group, didn’t like one interaction, so I removed myself from the situation.  

When I got home, I was replaying the interaction in my head. I definitely wanted to smoke, but I decided to read a book instead.  Within 20 minutes, I was sound asleep. 

Woke up today accepting of last night’s discomfort. It’s wild that I can choose to handle life’s realities instead of smoking for hours straight. Loving this shift in values, action, and perspective. 

Feeling proud about my recent choices!"
Don't let the festivities of the 4th of July holiday trick you into smoking. Fire up some fireworks or the grill instead. You can do it. 
"Smoking to sleep = bad quality sleep, smoking to wake up = not waking up, and smoking for fun = nothing is fun. TIME. TO. QUIT. These are the facts, and unless I get it down to at most twice a month my life is going to continue this downward spiral. Yesterday I had a great day, stuck to my schedule, and got everything done. Sober. So I decided to reward myself at the end of the day not with meditation and a good book, but with pot and some good ole Dota 2 (video games). The 2 hours I planned for relaxing at the end of the day turned into 7 FUCKING HOURS! And I was up until 4am getting high as hell and playing games. It was sort of fun, but here I am the next day, groggy, sleepy, bored, unproductive, and already out of time in the day to get done what I need to get done. I hate this. All I want is to follow my schedule, have good habits, and acheive my goals. I do not want to spend hours and hours alone in the dark with online strangers whilst doing drugs. 



What do you guys tell yourselves if you slip up? I tend to dwell on this type of thing and right now I'm quite mad at myself... Love you!"
"Quitting tip I've found useful Almost four weeks clean after smoking all day, everyday for years. Just thought I'd share something that has helped me so far. Basically start a list and record everything you've achieved since quitting, keep adding to it regularly and whenever you're tempted to smoke, read over the list. It'll remind you why you chose to give it up in the first place and show you what can be accomplished without Mary. My list has stuff on it like 'sorted out drivers liscense', 'getting more sociable' and so on. Hope this helps. Good luck, and remember, you can do this!"
"I didn’t buy weed today I just turned 21 yesterday, so for the last 7 years I have been smoking marijuana regularly, and for the last 4 years I haven’t been able to go more than 24 hours without smoking.

I don’t smoke copious amounts, just a bowl once or twice a day. I have Crohn’s disease and it helps bring back my appetite, alleviate inflammation, and generally helps me when it comes out of remission. It sucks because it genuinely helps me with my disease, which makes it even harder to even begin fighting my dependence.

And my dependence is just that. I spend hundreds of dollars on weed every year (and I am a very poor college student.) because I have no control. I must always have it, and when I begin running low, I hit my man for another 1/2 ounce. 

When I don’t have it I go crazy. My anxiety flares to it’s worst places. I panic over everything. My life plan feels hopeless, the tasks I need to complete seem impossible, the consequences to failing feel like they’ll be the literal end of the world. I can’t relax. I can’t focus. I can’t enjoy the things I like to do when I’m high (which is everything.) Suicidal thoughts sometimes come in common as thinking about the weather. It has nothing to do with the high either. I can be high as fuck, but the second I finish my last bud the panic sets in untill ive worked out with my dealer what time I’m picking up the next day.

There’s physical effects on my body as well. I stop eating almost completely as my appetite is gone. For example, when I travel with friends outside the country I lose weight like crazy because I physically can’t eat while I don’t have access to marijuana. My friends (who are coincidentally non-smokers) literally make it a priority to figure out how to safely get their sick friend weed any time we travel then plan around finding places where I can smoke so I can actually eat around every meal. It makes me feel like a huge burden to them. On a different trip to the Middle East it was even harder and more dangerous to find, and my weight dropped over thirty pounds while I was there. My doctor was immensely alarmed but just chalked it up to heat and an exit from remission rather than the more serious problem that I have- not that I’ve discussed it with her.

I want to quit so bad. I have law school coming up after my final year in college and beyond that the world. I’m tired of this shackle holding me down where ever I go. 

Two days ago I realized that I was running out. But rather than immediately dropping another 90 on a 1/2 ounce, I decided I would wait until the next day. 

Yesterday something within me told me that I could do this. And I was able to resist texting my dealer and forced myself to eat lightly.

Today I kept myself busy with work and studying for the LSAT, but in the back of my mind the urge and panic remained, gnawing at me. I felt like I KNEW I was going to break down when I was home for the night and go buy again. 

But I didn’t. It’s now 3am and I’m resisting the urge to get my pipe and do a resin hit. I know that I have a long, long way to go and I don’t know if I can ever have a casual relationship with weed or if I need to cut it out completely. I also don’t know that I’m strong enough to keep this up.

But for the first time in years: I didn’t buy weed today."
"Life is SO much better when your mind isn’t always occupied with the thought of when and how you’re going to get high next. When I was using heavily the thought of “when am I’m going to high next” and “how am I going to get high next” (mainly because I was broke from blowing all my money on weed) was never far from the forefront of my mind. It was practically my daily goal. I hated it. Now that I’m not smoking I can focus my attention, time, energy, and money on MUCH more meaningful and fulfilling things, such as family and friends, It’s very freeing not to be a slave to addiction."
"Day 23. Looking back, while I was using, weed took up so damn much mental space. I was always thinking about it in some way. The best part of quitting has been having the freedom to focus on life instead. "
"Instead of killing time, make use of it. Life keeps going after weed ... There's so much to do I used to smoke to kill time, now I been finding things to do. Suddenly life is happening before my eyes and I'm choosing to actively be a part of it. There's dishes to be cleaned, recipes to make, dogs to walk, people to see, workouts to happen. There's so much going on... It's been two weeks and I think I don't have anymore time left to kill. I even painted the other day. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was something."
"Almost there, can't believe it! "
"Unplanned check in, my dealer just got in touch 😱 I said no, don't worry!

Stay strong fellow leavers ❤️

EDIT: My luck continues... I'm no longer unemployed either 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳❤️

Thanks for all the comments and upvotes means a lot 💪🏻❤️"
"I'm done. I just woke up, and today is going to be my first day completely thc-free. I'm tired of having no motivation and not being present in my daily life. I'm not too great at long posts but it's long past time to do this.

Wish me luck guys.


Edit: Thank you guys so much for the support. I can't wait to start living life with a clear head."
"All you 20-something’s quitting smoking... ...you are awesome! I am so jealous of you all making these realisations at your age. You are young, you have a whole life ahead of you. You have made a decision that will make that life better, one way or another. It took me until my late 30’s to come to the same realisations as you and I am now thousands and thousands of ££s in debt. Don’t be me. Don’t wait until the debt and the guilt have eaten away at any self-respect you might have had. Even if you look at your life and think it’s a pile of shit thanks to weed/depression/insert life-issue here, you are taking a huge step towards improving your life by admitting that weed isn’t helping you, and choosing a life without it. 

You have my utmost admiration and respect for that. 🌟"
"Day 57 - My mood is finally starting to level out. Took me about 50 days or so to start to feel 'normal'. This takes time, commitment, consistency, hard work and most of all, patience. STICK WITH IT, DO NOT GIVE IN! Guys and gals, 

My mood has been much more consistent. Before, if I had a lack of sleep, that was a trigger for a depressing day. No joke, I'd be stressed and angry and just not in a good mood and I would be depressed. Now, I'm just tired like a normal adult. Wake up in a decent mood/kinda excited or whatever, but just tired like a normal fucking adult. I track my moods and the last week has been great. Even on Sunday, I was hungover AF but I wasn't depressed or triggered to smoke, I was just tired and hungover lol. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, DO NOT FUCKING GIVE IN. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PROGRESS AND GOT TO START OVER AND GO THROUGH ALL THAT DEPRESSIVE BULLSHIT AGAIN. 

&#x200B;

I have never been more determined to not smoke again or for a longgggg ass time. I love this consistent mood/sobriety life. Here are some keys:

&#x200B;

1. Consistent exercise 
2. Good diet
3. Talking with people and stepping out of your comfort zone 
4. Compliment and love yourself 
5. Take ownership of your life and stop being a bitch. Stay sober. Do the hard thing. Be an adult. No one gives a shit about you except you. Be cognoscente of your life decisions. The past is the past, the present in now and the future is determined by what you do right now. 
6. Fill your schedule with other things. You have to swap out being a stoner and doing nothing for actually doing something. Boredom is the biggest trigger to smoke.

&#x200B;

Good luck my friends, please reach out if you want to talk. I am here for you"
Wish me luck! 😐 
"I went to a reggae show last night It was great.  I smelled plenty of ganja but I wasn't tempted.  I enjoyed the show completely sober (I'm alcohol free as well) and I remember every minute.  I was even able to watch the young kids dancing and smoking with a sense of peace. Let the weed work for them until it doesn't, ya know? 3 weeks and 2 days down,  thanks for all your support and guidance. "
"60 days herbfree goddamn I’ve never been this sober in 24yrs. Been smoking since I was 15yrs old and I’m 39 now. I planned on stopping Jan 1st 2020, but I woke up dec 15th, 2019 took my weed trays, papers, bongs, pipes and just three in the the trash. I couldn’t deal with the pressure of having to wait till the 1st, so I was like fuck it let’s get it over it. The 1st week was HELL on earth (shout out to mobbing deep). But this community has been my saving grace. You guys and gals have supported me because I’ve never felt alone throughout my journey. During the toughest of times, this community always has a positive person that gives me encouraging advice that keeps me going. I’m taking it one day at a time never think about tomorrow until it gets here. To all my fellow quitters, thank you and keep it up. I appreciate you all."
"1 Year/365 Days Weed Free - This Is What I’ve Learned: A No BS Guide  

So you’ve decided you wanna quit smoking weed. Maybe you’ve been thinking about it for a while and you’re yet to make the change. Maybe you’ve started quitting already and it’s early days. Or maybe you’ve tried and failed multiple times and are just finding it too easy to get back to smoking that shit and going back to square one. This has ended up kinda long but I’ve tried to keep it readable. Besides, spending a few minutes making the effort even if you don’t feel like it at the beginning might be the kind of thing you can apply in your attempt to quit weed for good (more on that later).

&#x200B;

Some background (bear with me). I personally tried and failed a few times; I went about 6 weeks during one effort. There was a week here, a day or two there. I always seemed to go back to it at some point, but I wanted to quit and I didn’t like the way my life was with weed being a constant part of it: During my days of “peak usage”, and even at minimal usage to be honest, it’d be stuff like choosing to smoke after work instead of building new skills, being too stoned to cook so ordering shitty expensive takeaways or avoiding eating altogether, doing the bare minimum in terms of household tasks, wanting to watch a movie/play a video game high, but as soon as I was high I couldn’t even be bothered to choose a film or start up a game; I’d just sit in front of youtube consuming short form videos at the press of a button as it got later into the night and the videos got progressively more useless. Being too lazy to brush my teeth before bed, pissing in a bottle sometimes instead of leaving my room to walk across the landing and use the toilet at night, being unreliable, disorganised, life admin tasks building up around me, putting off social engagements because I’d rather be in my little stoned bubble. It was disgusting. Pathetic.

&#x200B;

I was 33 when I began my most recent effort to quit, and weed had been a part of my life to varying degrees since I was around 17. For a while there it was great. Smoking after work with friends and laughing until it hurt, smoking alone and having all my activities enhanced and just… better. I moved in with some friends and we all smoked every night, played games and just had a great time. I was in my twenties now and weed was just the best. Things were  fun and weed made it even more so. I moved in with a girl and my usage dipped. It was still in my life once or twice a week, but I smoked less (I was never a daytime, wake and bake kind of guy anyway. I’d do it occasionally but always felt a bit dirty being stoned and still having the day ahead of me. I guess I always had some kind of standard about what my lifestyle ought to be). Still, I was getting older - mid to late twenties at this point - and still wasting my time after work and not really making any life progress. I’d sleep in late, play video games, watch movies. My girlfriend was the opposite. The inevitable happened, I moved into a place on my own. It was a dark time and weed came back to comfort me. I decided to go self employed at the time too. Let me tell you, weed and depression do not make a good combination if you gotta be switched on enough to start a business. It was the worst, most shameful period of my life.

&#x200B;

So, after a few more years of being at rock bottom in every aspect of my life, seeing how my friends had transformed over the years from outgoing guys to introverted stoners (they still are to some degree. One of them now lives with me and his weed use is at an all time high) my mindset began to change and I started thinking seriously about how to get my shit together. 

&#x200B;

At this point I’ll offer you what I believe to be an important piece of advice: **Quitting weed will not solve your problems**. **But it will remove the obstacle that’s blocking your chances of solving them**. You land on the beaches of Normandy and start strutting around like the job is done, you're gonna get mown down. You gotta keep moving forward if you're gonna win the war. 

&#x200B;

I’ll also say this: I don’t believe I was addicted to weed. I was addicted to the short term dopamine rush I'd get when I finally sat down to smoke and enjoy short term, shitty rewards in the form of youtube videos, porn, junk food etc. Try rolling a joint and then just not smoking it for a while. It’s not so hard because you know it’s there whenever you want to light it up. Smoking that joint? It’s wonderful. As soon as it’s finished? Boring. Oh well, better roll another. It’s not being stoned that’s fun; it’s *getting* stoned (not counting the early days when you start smoking weed). In fact, if you’re reading this you’re probably at that point where being stoned makes you feel like shit every night as you try to mask the state of your situation. So no, I don’t believe I was addicted to weed. I was addicted to that life of short term dopamine and zero effort, which leads me to what I consider the “secret” to quitting weed, and to a better life than your current one:

&#x200B;

**Discipline**. **The way to stop smoking is to not smoke**. The way I did that is via not being soft and going right back to smoking the minute it started getting hard. If I really wanted to quit and better my situation then that’s what I had to do, no two ways about it. **Nothing worth doing is easy**. The hard times will last a week or two - nothing in the grand scheme of things. But it might feel like everything at the time because you’ve conditioned yourself as a stoner to avoid any kind of real effort. **The weed life is the easy life, the easy life is the shit life**. Expect sleepless nights, vivid dreams, nightmares, a feeling called boredom you might not have felt for some time. The feeling of having nothing to do. Except that’s isn't true. Start using that feeling to do something else. Get up, sort your paperwork, tidy your house, do the dishes, brush your teeth, start a project, pick up a project you left hanging, start some tutorials on something. These amazing feats of productivity are what regular people call real life, something I had been numbing myself to all this time while I polluted my brain with weed. And the more you do these tasks, the more they become normal. So you start picking up new ones bit by bit. They snowball. I’m sure you might find it easy to play an RPG; start a character from nothing, grind along the way, keep levelling up, completing repetitive quests for that sweet reward, getting better and more powerful along the way - as humans that’s what we do to make us happy, but you gotta apply it to your own life.

&#x200B;

One of my favourite motivational guys, David Goggins, calls it callusing the mind. The more hard shit you do, the stronger your mind becomes and the easier those things become. Back then I was soft. I had to become hard. As humans we’re supposed to do shit. We do a task to some degree of difficulty, we complete that task, we feel good about it. The harder the task, the bigger the reward when it’s complete. You even get a reward for pursuing the task in the first place and actively making progress. It’s keeping on top of these tasks and objectives, following some form of path, that gives us a feeling that some might call happiness.

&#x200B;

But back to the weed. I wasn't doing shit until it was gone. It’s a plant. I was destroying my life by smoking a plant. It had to stop. You can make quitting easier for yourself by tapering off for a while. That’s exactly what I did. I smoked one joint a night for around a few weeks before my most recent attempt to quit. And I’d smoke it right before bed. I’d get all my shit done using discipline, reward myself with the joint. But a joint every night is still weed every night which meant weed in my system holding me back, so it had to go.

&#x200B;

I stopped smoking one year ago today and I’ve never looked back. I don’t miss it at all. I live with a stoner; my friends are stoners. The phrase “high on life” always seemed like bullshit to me but it’s accurate. There was a time when watching a movie without weed would have seemed so boring, so vanilla, but I don’t notice it now. Ever watched a film baked, felt like you were completely immersed, then barely remember watching it the next day? I’m 100% dialled in to everything via a combination of zero weed, and effort to keep the plates that are my life spinning. And I’m far from a success, by the way. But I get out of bed with no grogginess, I arrive to work early, I brush my teeth every night without fail, I pay my bills early, I add to/tick things off of my Google Keep to-do list every night, I work out 3 days a week right after work, I sit at my computer after work and build my skillset, I tick that off my Loop Habit Tracker app every day along with “Don’t Smoke Weed” that I added on there exactly a year ago today. I keep on top of household tasks, I don’t nap anymore, I sleep about 8 hours a night of real, good quality sleep with real dreams, I wake up early even on my days off. I look and feel better than I have for years. I’m responsible and I’m organised. I’ve just sat down and typed this out a few days before I posted it as it was on my to-do list and I wanted to have it typed up ready for today.

&#x200B;

Anyway, It won’t be easy but nothing worth doing is. The weed life is the easy life, the easy life is the shit life. Stay Hard, as my man Goggins would say."
"I am definitely addicted and I am quitting right now I’ve only have a few 2 week breaks since I started smoking 10 years ago. I’m 26. That, in itself, is crazy! I always rationalize even though I know it makes me anxious, lazy, unable to communicate, a worse-version of myself. I now realize that’s my addict brain. I use weed for everything. Always tuning out, always procrastinating... My brain is now dependent on it, and it shows with my moods and my harmful behaviors and sleep patterns. 

I don’t want to accept the mediocre version of myself that weed perpetuates. I want to be clear headed. I want to heal the pain I’ve been avoiding since I started smoking. I have to be confident and present to do that- two things that weed doesn’t allow for. 

I smoked this morning before the gym(bc I’ve paired weed with everything) and normally I would smoke the rest of the day since I already started...tell myself to start sobriety tomorrow.. then never start... NOT TODAY I am going to run it out and stay sober. That was my last smoke, ya’ll. 

Is this also the place to vent about withdrawal? Bc I fear I have a gnarly few weeks of feelings coming."
"One of the reasons r/leaves is so great is because we're not all going completely crazy on the same day. If you're having a day that isn't driving you crazy or may be looking up, be sure to come by and care for the people who aren't. I think I'm repurposing a stupid thing I saw on facebook, but it's true: every day on r/leaves I see people in crisis being helped by people not in crisis, and then a day or a week or a month later, the roles are reversed, and the person who was in crisis is helping someone else.

Love all you guys and how much you give back in exchange for your own sobriety."
"Found a nugget of weed... I just moved to a new house with my lady. I was looking for the charger to my cordless drill (yay household chores!) and at the bottom of a box of junk I found a small nugget of weed.

I held that nug. I stared at it. I thought about hiding it so that when my lady was at work today, I could smoke it when I was alone.

I sized it up. I thought about just how high I'd get from that much weed. How many hits it would break down to. Four, maybe even five if I took small ones.

I smelled it. I looked for hiding places. I felt terrible. I saw a glimpse of my former self.

I went to the kitchen sink. I crushed up the nug, and smelled the herb and dammit I missed it. I tossed it in the sink, turned on the water, and watched it go away. Washed the smell off my hands, and went on about my chores.

The streak remains. Stay strong out there. "
"Seven month checkin - I don't think about it at all anymore I don't think about weed when I wake up in the morning (when I used to wake and bake)

I don't think about weed when I talk to my stoner friends

I don't think about weed at the end of the work day (when I used to be itching to close out and go get stoned)

I don't think about weed when I'm upset

I don't think about weed at night after the kids are in bed

Pretty much the only time I think about it is when I read posts on r/leaves, and I don't mind because when I'm supporting other folks here...I feel free"
"Day 1 of quitting weed. Flushed a bag of 10g I just bough yesterday. I cant sleep now and I feel sad I really want to quit weed. It affects you in a way you only see when you quit and are sober. Ive always felt I had more energy and I was more myself and clear headed whenever I tried to quit before.  This time is the right one, I quit cigarettes after being a heavy smoker for 9 year This friday it will be my fourth week nicotine free. Now Its weeds turn! I dont want to be a pot head anymore, or constantly high. I want to enjoy stuff Without thinking that I have to light up first.

Fuck weed, it gets you addicted without you even realizing it and its so hard to quit! 

You guys and this sub are helping me a lot! I hope I will make it!"
"Just hit a year of being substance free from everything, alcohol included. I just hit a year of being completely sober from everything. I feel good, but unfortunately I really just have the urge to order a volcano from storz and Bickel and vape more than ever now, especially with how boring it has been during this whole covid situation. I’ve been making the most of my days, been working out frequently, reading a bit, making money investing, and getting straight A’s in all my online classes. Yet the monotony of life without being able to occasionally get a substance buzz and escape from dull-witted reality seems depressing and vainly pointless. Anyone else at this point who is feeling similar, or has any advice? I know how slippery of a slope it can be going back. As I’ve quit and went back many times in my life, but this is the longest I’ve ever made it, and the fact that I went balls to the wall and took drinking out fully too made it that much more challenging (although I’ve never had a problem or addictive personality at all with drinking). I know I’m strong enough to continue on this journey but I feel it to be pointless if I can’t still learn to truly enjoy life along the way and celebrate all the hard work I’ve put in. I’ve saved a lot of money, taken care of my body, and am blessed to have a great group of core friends and family around me, yet I just want to be able to enjoy a smoke session and a few drinks here and there. At this point I’m just rambling lol but all advice/perspective would be much appreciated. Much love to all of you✌️🙏"
"Anyone else get hella pissed off all the time after they quit? I'm only four days clean, but damn it, I get pissed off at tons of little things now, and it's driving me up a wall. Anyone have a problem of being on the borderline of rage the whole day when they quit?

Edit: I went for a bike ride, ate, and squeezed one out. Feeling much better. It's not gone, but I feel better"
"53 days clean!! One of the hardest things I have done so far, but one of the best! Please, if you’re thinking of quitting, you can do it!!! ♥️♥️♥️ "
"I ""relapsed"" last night after 476 days Last night I smoked, and it was an overall beneficial experience for me.

&nbsp;

I'd been sober for 1 year and ~3 months, and had/have been feeling confident in my ability to abstain since the winter holidays. My life has changed drastically since I got sober, dream job, moved states, and most importantly I've recently begun to enjoy life without the use of intoxicants. When I first quit I thought I'd never have fun again, and that certainly seemed true for the first 6 months, but as time went on that's disproved itself over and over again. Being sober has given me the opportunity to address the root causes of my substance use (marijuana has always been my drug of choice, but in the past it didn't matter what I was putting into my body as long as I felt inebriated) I've made lots of progress on my depression and suicidal tendencies, and have gotten close to ridding myself of a previously crippling anxiety with the help of prescribed medications and Cognitive Behavioral therapy. Life still isn't perfect, it never will be, but 5-6/7 days of the week I feel damn good.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I drove a couple hours to visit an old friend, a brother, somebody who'd I'd lived with and used with, and the only person whose ever known me better than I know myself. He's still self-medicating with drugs in a very unhealthy way, and I knew going in I'd be around plenty of weed. In the past 4 months I've started going to parties again, and surprisingly having a great time regardless of being the only sober person and surrounded by intoxicants, so I wasn't worried about losing control of myself. And I didn't.

&nbsp;

We had a great afternoon, walked to the beach, longboarded, had the deep meaningful talks only two people who are on the same wavelength can. He was high the whole time, I was sober, but it felt just like the old times except less depressing. When we settled in that night to get lost in the weird depths of youtube, I had an idea. I knew I could have a perfectly fun time with him sober, but I wanted to try smoking again; an experiment. At the very worst I'd be starting from day 1 again and have a month or so of strong cravings, and at best I'd learn I could smoke recreationally. I was torn between trying the experiment or not, I thought it might be useful, but the thought of starting at day 1 again was painful. I decided to flip a coin, heads I smoke, tails I don't. The coin landed on heads.

&nbsp;

So I smoked.

&nbsp;

To my complete surprise it was...meh. I had built up what being high felt like in my head so much during my sobriety that the real thing just couldn't even come close to living up to it. At the end of the night while falling asleep I had the biggest shock of all, I regretted smoking. Not because I felt guilty for relapsing, or because I was worried I'd sent my self back down the spiral of abuse, but because I would have had more fun if I'd stayed sober. I disliked how cloudy I felt, how my anxiety got worse, and how I ate an entire bag of cereal dry. I disliked losing my train of thought, not being able to hold up a meaningful conversation, and the god damn cotton mouth. I disliked feeling sluggish, lazy, and like I'd be fine with never leaving the couch again. I disliked being high.

&nbsp;

What a marvelous revelation. I went from feeling like I was missing out by not partaking, to now being truly grateful that I'm not. I woke up this morning with no urge to smoke again. 

&nbsp;

This is truly the best outcome, one that I hadn't even considered."
"My favourite quote about weed The best thing I've ever heard about weed comes from an episode of South Park, back in season 6 I believe, where Randy is finally honest with Stan about the dangers of smoking pot after using lies and manipulation to scare him away from it the whole episode. He says something along the lines of ""look, pot won't kill you, or turn you into some kind of monster, but the truth is it makes you feel ok with being bored. And it's when you're bored when you should be learning a new skill or bettering yourself in some way"". It's always really stuck with me, he's absolutely right. For the last two years of my life I spent high, I was just bored all the time and fine with it, and that's no way to live a life. Six weeks sober now, and really enjoying finally beginning to feel like a real person again"
"Weed the Sleep Killer!! Weed is bad for your sleep. Sure maybe you get more hours of sleep, but the sleep is less restful, this has been well documented in multiple studies. Also do you think not dreaming could possibly be good for you? There is a reason we dream, and weed inhibits the dreams. I think dreaming and deep sleep has a lot to do with memory storage and function and this is why chronic smokers have memory and recall problems. Can’t remember the name of that band? Forgot you had to do that thing? Ditch the weed and dream again, get a solid nights rest and be ready for the day. Stop interrupting the nature of nature. We are primordial perfection, perfect as is; a magical robot. Weed is like mud on a white wedding cake."
"The problem wasn’t so much weed; it was ME This was being discussed at a meeting I went to. Yes, I know I can’t do it anymore. There is no way I can get into weed again and have it be OK. Just no way. And that’s scary to accept. But I have to if I care about myself. And I do care about myself. 

However I realize as time goes by that it wasn’t weed; it was ME. Because even after being weed-free for 6 months, I still have a lot of the same problems!! In other words, I am still me. Just a less crazy fucked up version. 

The immediate problems are gone, but I feel the long term ones stewing beneath the surface still. Maybe they will always be there. (Maybe I need to talk about them more so they are less threatening.)

I had to get weed out of the way so I at least have a CHANCE to change my longtime issues of isolation, low self-confidence, anxiety, procrastination, indecisiveness, anger, depression, and resentment. To name a few. 

My weed addiction wasn’t the root of the problem; it was the sign of how bad things had finally become inside."
"The temporary euphoric high you get from weed is seriously not worth it for how it make you feel throughout the next day I’ve started to liken it to stimulants from back in the day. Yes, ecstasy was nice at the time but the next day (and beyond) made me feel like shit. Weed does the same after smoking the night before - no motivation, low mood, indecision etc.

Stay strong people. Do not give up on giving up, it really isn’t worth it. Think how much better you feel waking up with a clearer mind as each day passes.

Nearly one month clean now and I’m fully done with giving Mary Jane my energy."
"240 Days In and smoked twice yesterday Just making this post as an accountability post for myself.

I work as a tax preparer so it was my first day off since January 20th. I got a little excited and ended up taking two hits from my friends Joint in the afternoon and at night a bong hit. 

I'm writing this because although I smoked twice yesterday Im not gonna be too hard on myself and just keep it going. I know that I shouldn't keep on smoking and to be honest it wasn't anything special anyway. I'm glad that I am not a stoner anymore smoking every day!"
"not smoking weed feels so fucking great 7 year daily toker here.

i smoked because i was ""tired and needed to rest tonight."" i felt more tired the next day.

i smoked because i ""felt depressed."" i was still down and foggy the next morning.

i smoked because i was bored. then i was just bored and high.

i smoked because i was ""taking today off, and i'll be even more productive tomorrow!"" then i just wanted to take the next day off, too.

i used to do things! i used to read books and play music and go on adventures. and then i started doing those things while high, and wow! it was so much fun. and then smoking weed *became* the activity, instead of being *part* of the activity. and then i just smoked weed. and then i was just boring and high.

i have used the herb to escape many things in the last seven years. i'm in professional school. i'm in great shape and have a sexy girlfriend. i have all the things most people cite when needing reasons to ""quit and get their shit together."" but i am capable of even more! everyone is capable of more. i have not had a healthy relationship with cannabis for a long time.

i am on day five and not smoking is just fucking great. i am proud of myself every minute that i choose to do something other than smoking weed. 

-------

i did LSD and mushrooms a couple of times during college in the name of psychedelic exploration- some of my best realizations about life and my place in it came from those trips. i remember being so damn uncomfortable at times on acid, and i remember the glorious, triumphant comedown on the back end of a trip. i remember thinking i had overcome something, and i was always beautifully aware and mindful and focused in the days after the trip. 

i decided to treat the first few days of sobriety like a ""trip."" i embraced being uncomfortable. i embraced sitting on my couch sweaty and unable to sleep on the first night. i embraced the unpleasant disruption of my nightly ritual. i was *present* with myself, and for the first time in months i actually *felt* what i was feeling. it wasn't pleasant, but it was real. and it was so much better than 'just getting high.'


change is a natural part of life. don't be afraid to change. don't be afraid to be a better version of yourself. don't be afraid to be present within your own life- if you spend it numb and stoned, it could slip you by.

"We're awesome! It doesn't matter where you are, maybe you are in the early stages and contemplating, maybe you just got through the first 24 hours, 30 days or 300 days, it doesn't matter. Perhaps you've smoked for 1 year, or ten. You should all give yourselves a pat on the back for acknowledging and accepting that you need to make a change and doing something about it. For many participating in a group like this will be the extra boost they need. There are so many who never get to this point to try to help themselves. You are awesome because you have the wherewithal to make a change and you are trying. Even if you think you have failed, you're still here reading this and that means you haven't because you are still trying. Keep up the good work everyone."
"Haven’t dabbled with the Jazz cabbage in over a month for the first time since my junior year of high school!! My mind feels clear and I’ve been getting so much done lately :) I feel so much better about life in general and I’ve picked up a lot of healthy habits. I hope everyone is having a good day and I wish u all success on this path ❤️
Love
John"
"3 year secret I’ve never told anyone in my life that I smoked weed everyday. It has made my life worse and I’ve felt nothing but embarrassment and weakness. Days and nights are structured around when I can get high. I feel like I have to be high before ANYTHING I do but I’m not even happy when I’m high, I’m just not sad. Today was my first sober day in a long time, I’m proud of myself and I wanted somewhere to share that.

This post is more of a confession than anything and I’m hoping it will make the process of quitting more real."
"Weed and Depression: Lying to Yourself This post is about my experiences with a deep and dark depression, and my abuse of cannabis which only exacerbated the issue. 

To start off, I will give some background to my issues with depression. I grew up in an abusive household. My first experiences with it came before birth as I’ve heard stories of my father beating my mother while she was in the late stages of being pregnant with me. Black eyes and cut faces were not an uncommon sight in my household. On the night of my 11th birthday my mom couldn’t take it anymore and I watched as she attempted suicide in my kitchen. After that night my parents were divorced. The divorce was tough on me and the first time I’d attempted suicide I was 11-12. I remember praying to God asking him to take me to heaven as early as 6 years old. I went through most of my life horribly depressed and didn’t realize it until highschool.

This is where weed came on the scene. My sophomore year I smoked for the first time and felt really good. I remember equating the feeling to when you’re walking barefoot on hot sand on the beach and then you touch the water of the beach and instantly feel that cooling sensation. Weed and me were a match made in heaven. I spent the next three years smoking everyday, and doing relatively well in life. I was a captain on my football team, and a top 10 hurdler in San Diego county. I also had a relatively high GPA. I graduated highschool and this is where it all came crashing down.

My first year spent in the real world was a wake up call because I could no longer use my highschool achievements as a crutch since they no longer mattered. To make matters worse I had lost my motivation for sports and quit my collegiate football team. (I truly blame this on my weed abuse). 

This is where my depression caught up with me. I could not get out of bed when I had free time for the life of me. I would get home and immediately just collapse on my floor and dream of killing my self. The only thing that got me out of the house was to smoke weed. I would feel good then, but the entire day before that point would be consumed in suicidal thoughts. I lied to myself so much about my weed abuse, saying that it was helping my depression when in reality it only made it worse. I only felt good when I smoked, and the rest of the day was a pit of despair.

Oh May 24th of this year I had worked up enough steam and decided that was going to be the night I killed myself. Only when it came time to do it I pussied out. Thank God I did. 4 days later I got a call with a job offer in Wyoming. I accepted with no second thoughts, and have been here the last 2 and 1/2 months. In that time I have not smoked. My depression has slowly reversed. I attribute it to my sobriety, and this new feeling of moving forward with my life. Each day gets easier. I still long for weed, and want to smoke so badly. Not sure if that will ever go away. My belief is that my brains reward system is slowly being reset to normal levels. I feel good when I accomplish something or learn something new. This is what gets me out the door whenever I have free time to do hikes or adventure. I never used to care about these things because my mind was set on snapping a big old bowl that evening.

Tl:dr/The point of my story: Weed fucking bodies your desire to experience new things. Being uncomfortable is good because it often implies growth. You will not grow in the hazy comfort of beautiful bud. Weed should not be considered a medicine for depression because it only makes you comfortable in the circumstances which caused the depression in the first place. You train yourself to be content with something which your spirit despises. Depression, anxiety, and anger are the mechanisms your spirit uses to tell your conscious mind to fucking change something. If you shut your spirit up by sedating it, your spirit is still dying but you no longer have the motivation to change the pattern."
"30 years stoned - 72 days sober - Reality check, thoughts, and aspirations. I will never be able to ""moderate"" my weed consumption because I am an addict.

I will never again believe the lies that Mary Jane told me when I was a user.

I will enjoy my sobriety everyday, even when days are difficult because life is not always kind.

I will aspire to be a giver.  A giver of love, strength, and encouragement.

I will cultivate my being by first pulling out the weeds of despair, and planting kindness in their place.

I will enjoy the discoveries I have not yet discovered.

I will no longer escape fear by escaping and getting stoned. I will confront it, and learn what fear has to teach me.

I will not let a bad day in the past ruin my future.

I will always remember that no matter how difficult life seems, there is always something I can be successful doing.

"500 days sober, found a dab cart in a vent... So a while ago I vacuumed out all of vents, cause that’s the kind of stuff you do when you’re sober rather than smoking all your money up. I left one dirty because it’s under this big book shelf with lots of breakables on it, and was also just tired of cleaning. I was burning incense and dropped my lighter down there, didn’t see it, put my phone flash light on it, and what do you know! A FULL dab cart, perhaps from me or the girl who lived here before me as she was a huge stoner who actually sold me carts and fake carts all the time... And lots of Christmas tree needles, as in 2017 she had her Christmas tree above that very spot... I have been struggling with sobriety in quarantine, particularly with weed, because it’s not that bad, right? If I was still smoking, I would have immediately moved the book shelf, probably broke a few things, lifted up the grates, put the filthy cart into my pen and see if it still hit... Sober me just went back to being sad and bored and lonely, without making my life 10000 times worse by breaking my sobriety to get stoned alone off of what is probably almost a 3 year old dab pen lol..."
"Just because you have a long sobriety spree doesnt mean you can smoke again and control it. My warning. 

Im a 23 year old guy from Canada. I first tried the devils lettuce when i was just 13 years old. From than on out i had always had an unhealthy relationship with weed. It took over my life for 7.5 years untill i finally had enough and quit. July 1st wouldve been my 3 year sobriety, but i relapsed back in december. After 2.5 years of sobriety 

For 2 and a half years i was clean! 2 and a half years! And than this Christmas i thought hey you know what? I can have a little puff, why not? and i tried it. Nope. I tried to justify it in my mind like oh ""now ive got my career started ive finished school ive basically cured my depression and anxiety i wont use weed as a crutch this time around because now im in control of my life."" 

I had one bong rip. One. And 2 days later i bought a half ounce of kush a bong and a grinder. 2 months after that i was already onto extracts. I started with ""only smoking on the weekends"" (ya okay hemphead) and at its peak i was dabbing 3-4 times a day. Every. Day. 

Guess what? My anxietys back my depression is DEFFENITLY back and now my irritable bowel syndrome is back as well. 

Why?

Why'd i throw it all away? 

Because thats addiction. My brain was still against me. It still after all this time manipulated me into thinking i was okay to smoke. 

Im not. 

And i never will be.

Round two begins now and i know it wont be hard this time because now i know the truth. Im just one of those people that cant smoke weed. 

July 5th 2018 was the last time i got stoned."
94 on first engineering midterm this semester! Average was a 77 too so I’m pumped. Would’ve cheated my way through if I were still smoking. Been studying 12 hours a day for the last week and I’m not even getting tired. This sub literally saved me so thank you everyone. And screw Mary Jane.
How come we only know that smoking weed is bad while smoking weed lol 
"20 reasons why I want to quit smoking weed 1. Groggy mornings
2. Often tired
3. I second guess my sober self (my real self) when I get high
4. Recurring negative thought patterns
5. Bad memory
6. Always craving something
7. Anxiety when not high
8. Big distractor from goals and dreams
9. Dulls the senses / emotions
10. Less emotional maturity (runaway from problems mentality)
11. Slower reaction time
12. Loss of wide range of vocabulary
13. ""I'll do it tomorrow"" mentality
14. Uncertainty of my true feelings
15. Gateway to other addictions
16. No energy to do mentally difficult tasks or tiring tasks
17. Easily more irritable when doing meticulous tasks. I think ""screw this I just want to be high""
18. “Pot is for the people who want to distract themselves from the difficulty of reality”
19. Wasting time, sitting around, lazy, anti-social
20. Causes daydream about a different, better life that leave me stuck

Ive been getting high for about 8 years and I realize how strongly its affected me living the life of my dreams. In fact I've realized that getting high has been a distraction used as a tool to make myself feel better for not following my passions and what my spirit is telling me. Im on the spectrum of one or the other. Especially when I'm home alone getting high often.

Don't get me wrong, weed has many beautiful benefits. But when it becomes an escape from what I'm really feeling, it causes suffering. Weed has always been there for me when I haven't been there for myself. When I've neglected my feelings, my energies, my passions. I turn to weed to make me feel better. So thank you weed for what you've done so far. But I can handle the rest without you.

One year ago I made a conscious decision to change my life... 
Smoking weed is like hitting the snooze button on life 
"Smoked more last joints than some ever have. Hey there guys, first post here and generally more of a lurker on reddit but I figured I'll share some stuff here, because it's quite important for me and my journey of quitting.

&#x200B;

So, I'm living in Germany, 20 years old and have been smoking for close to 6 years, way too long to begin with. Since my 18th Birthday I've probably smoked close to everyday, not huge amounts like some of you may have, but at least 1-2 joints per day, way more on the weekends obviously...Smoking for so long I think it's just logical that almost all my friends are smoking as well, which doesn't make any of this easier. I'm also living in an area where weed in general is just really popular and easily accessible, which stems from the fact that we are really close to the netherlands.

I think most of you can relate to the good ole days, somehow getting your weed after getting send from number to number, sneaking through the neighbourhood looking for a secret smoking spot, then sneaking in high as fuck and having the time of your life laughing your asses off over hilarious convos and videos.

But somehow someway these times started to fade, the more you smoked, the more regular it got, the more it went from this really fun high to a quite boring, couchlocky, demotivating high. Binging some stupid tv shows, not remembering half of it, playing video games spaced out af, just kinda vegetating together in your room. While others went out with their friends, doing fun activities, going to the bars (not saying that alcohol is better, but you get what I mean) you were just living life on standby. And weed kinda told me that it was ok. It never really occured to me just how much time I was wasting day to day, night to night doing something, but not really doing anything at all. I guess some of you can relate.

&#x200B;

Somewhere around last year my highs have also become quite uncomfortable, with racing thoughts almost everytime and not really enjoying the high anymore at all. It happened really often, but I still continued because ""the good old highs will come again for sure"". But no, weed started giving me really bad panic attacks most of the time, which maybe started because my life didn't fall apart per se, but it just didn't go the way I wanted it to. School was not going as well as it should have, me and my gf of 2.5 years broke up and in general I just became kind of a sad person deep down, even if it didn't seem so to most other people, I was pretty good at masking it. To this day I don't know if I really had some kind of depression, but I just wanted to numb everything out with weed, which didn't work anymore because of those panic attacks.

&#x200B;

A few months ago I stumbled across this subreddit in a /r/trees comment section and scrolled through here for a bit, but I was still convinced that all of my problems didn't have anything to do with weed (which I know not all of them do, but most of them). More to that later.

&#x200B;

Also a few months ago I found the instagram page of a girl that really sparked my interest, she literally looks like the girl of my dreams, I couldn't create a more beautiful girl for me even if god gave me the tools to do so, she also lives in the town right next to mine. I said fuck it, send her a message and she actually answered, even though she is in my eyes way out of my league. We were messaging on and off and a few weeks later we arranged a date. At this time I was still smoking daily. The day came, we met and I was nervous as fuck, probably the most nervous I've ever been, more nervous than before my A Levels or aynthing like that. Weed also made my social anxiety and awkwardness worse, which didnt help at all.The date went okay, but after she messaged me and told me that I was just not really conversative, not really talking much myself, just answering to stuff that she said and generally not really coming up with topics myself. That shit hit me hard, I used to be a really witty talker, not to tap my own shoulder or anything, but I used to be a good talker. Hearing this from her, kinda opened my eyes, I didnt even notice how much weed had affected my ability to socialice with other people, how much it affected my life in generaly, how little I was actually doing in life that I have so little interesting stuff to talk about. It kinda crushed me, but we still continued messaging and all that, but not much anymore.

Now last sunday was the day I decided it was time to quit for good, my lungs were getting fucked up, I felt foggy all the time, you know what I'm talking about. This wednesday I then messaged her again, asking if we might meet up again, and luckily she agreed for this friday, yesterday.

Again I was nervous, but not close to as nervous as I was the time before.

And what should I say, it went great. My socials skills were back after almost a week, I could hold a conversation and eye contact, come up with topics, ask interesting questions about stuff she talked about and generally engage so much more in the conversation.

She told me she had a great time and it seems like we'll be meeting up more often now, and I couldn't be happier, it's encouraging me even more to stay off of weed, the best motivation I could probably have, getting the girl of my dreams.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text guys, but I just needed to get all of this off my chest, have a great day and stay strong guys! (And wish me luck!! :P)

"A month without smoking with my fiancé Last night we ordered pizza to celebrate :) and it feels great to be always present, to have energy and i feel like we are connecting better.

I wish you strength to continue adding days sober!!"
"I wasn't missing anything... Boyfriend and I decided to break our almost 2.5-month streak of sobriety. We'd both been missing it, and were curious if our habits had changed (ie - could we moderate?). I've felt like a zombie for the past few days. No energy, no focus, no drive. My lungs hurt, my mouth is dry, and I've got a wicked headache. If anything, this has served as a great reminder of why I gave it up in the first place. I wasn't missing *anything*. I'm done with it. Totally done."
"I didn’t smoke weed today I was in an old and comfortable situation where I would’ve smoked my face off 100% a couple weeks ago.

I didn’t. Feels good, man.

✌️"
One Day At A Time - The small reminders make the biggest difference for me 
"One year weed free today! I smoked weed daily for about 4 years (from 21 to 25 years old) and smoked frequently with friends for 5ish years before that. 

At this date last year I was in the hospital, hooked on an IV after a week straight of not being able to eat or drink anything. As soon as I got to the hospital and told the triage nurse what symptoms I had, she asked me if I smoked weed frequently, to which I said yes. I got sent into the back on a bed straight away, and after a while a doctor came and told me I was very likely suffering from Cannabinoid Hyperhemesis Syndrome. 

I had read a little bit about it before, but I’ve had issues with digestion and vomiting (which I take meds for) for a long time before I started smoking weed regularly so never thought the 5-6 times I was sick every month were due to the fact I was smoking too much marijuana... Then the doctor told me the only real way for the constant nausea, not being able to eat, and vomiting to cease was to stop smoking weed. 

I haven’t smoked since. 

I was so sick all the time I just couldn’t take it anymore, and the fact that the answer to my problems was so “easy” made me stop smoking right there without looking back. 

I can’t say I didn’t miss weed at all during the past year. I did. I missed it *a lot* at first, because it was such a habit for me and it was kind of like a safe place. I had to relearn how to do everything sober, like watching tv shows, drawing, sleeping, and eating. It was really hard at first, and I felt like shit and I wanted to smoke so bad sometimes, but on the other hand I could eat everything and not risk throwing it up after a few hours or the next morning, and that was the thing that trumped every other insidious weed smoking thoughts I had. 

I am also fortunate enough to have a very supportive girlfriend who helped me through the process. She also, on my request, took my weed box and hid it somewhere in the house. I haven’t tried to search for it once, and I am pretty proud of that. 

Overall, I’m really happy that I stopped smoking. I didn’t want to see that I smoked a lot and that I used weed to hide from my problems. I am also much more healthy now (I’ve gained weight, but at least it’s because I can eat all the things and not throw up every other morning ahaha) and I think about weed way less. 

I’m still nostalgic of the times I spent high with my friends and what fun we had, but I’m still able to have as much fun with them sober. I’m also happy that I dream every night now, it makes sleep that much more interesting! And I’m not ever paranoid that people will know I’m high anymore because I’m never high anymore ahaha. 

I feel like I’m rambling so I’ll end this here (this is so long I’m so sorry), but I’m really glad for this community. I’m just a lurker, but it helped me to see other people’s experiences with quitting weed and it greatly helped me to see that recovery is not linear and that having setbacks is okay. 

I wish everyone here the best and to have a great day!"
"Two days sober! Going on hour 50 of no weed. I know it’s not that impressive but I’ve spent the last few years getting high everyday, usually all day. I’ve been subbed here for over a year and finally decided that I can’t continue at this rate. All of the posts here are so inspiring and I’m proud to be apart of this amazing community!"
"Hi leaves! in 3 days will be my 11 months weed free, and today is my 74th day without alcohol its weird its been so long that today I went to my friends birthday and they were all like, remember last year? and i was like I do! i guess i quit the next month but thats indication that a whole year had passed somehow hahaha I turned down a joint twice actually and didnt drink a drop although i dont actually have a drinking problem but quit for personal reasons! much love!"
"I have hobbies again; celebrating 3mo. sober I didn’t fully realize how much time I wasted getting baked and doing nothing. Like Randy on South Park said, smoking weed makes you fine with being bored.

I forgot how much I enjoy making things with my hands. I’ve rekindled and furthered my love for metalsmithing and woodworking. Past couple weeks I’ve been spending my evenings in the garage having a great time making stuff—little robot figurine, mini tank for my fiancé, and more. And I can’t believe how much more productive I am at work!

Tonight my fiancé and I are going to get some ice cream to celebrate his raise at work and my three months sober. Life is good."
"I'm now 6 months clean. To the lurkers, and the strugglers. You really can do it. You've lived life without weed before, and you can definitely do it again. Something that helped me is remembering that even if I'm smoking or not, time goes by at the same rate. 2 weeks from now, do I want to be proud of myself or be disappointed in myself for smoking?

You have the willpower, but you're too afraid to accept reality without it. You have the ability, but not the drive. You have a goal in mind, but not the strength to make it. You think this way, but you have ALL of these things! Challenge yourself. Learn from yourself, and remember your not alone. You can do it. I love and believe in all of you."
"I have to face reality now. I am 40 plus days sober and now have nothing to mask my feelings, past, and reality. My brain is on overdrive. I can't seem to accept myself this way. I want to smoke but I don't at the same time. Facing my real life is almost disturbing to me. But I have to try. I just dont know a lot of who I am. Now I have to figure it out.

Just venting."
"Sober is the new high Every time I get a craving to get stoned I tell myself you will hate that feeling after the first hit. It ain’t worth it, being sober and clear is the New high after 10 years of having my system flooded with THC. I told myself do it socially with friends here and there, fuck that I don’t even want it in my system. Rather be alone and present in my mind and life, not numbed out. I feel like I’m missing out if I bury weed but we all gotta grow up, I wouldn’t want my kids becoming potheads if I had kids so why should I keep pumping myself with poison. It’s literally awful for mental health but everyone thinks it’s “medicine” and goodforyou. What an oxymoron lol."
"I wish I could smoke weed every night and not have to worry about the side effects. Weed is so great, but at the same time it sucks. "
"Recently hit 3 months clean. Here are some improvements I've noticed. I wrote this as a reply to another thread but thought it might be worth posting in case it helps anyone stay motivated. I know the first month can be tough but I promise things get better

 1. Clear thoughts and better short term memory

 2. Much better sleep quality

 3. I'm more self disciplined and motivated

 4. Anxiety is pretty much completely gone and can no longer constantly feel my heart pounding

 5. Much happier in general

 6. More social and less awkwardly self conscious

 7. Proud of myself every day

 8. Started new hobbies and routines that I would have never done while I was a stoner

 9. I enjoy films and TV shows more

 10. Reading is easier and more enjoyable

 11. My diet has improved

 12. I've saved lots of money that otherwise would have been wasted on getting high

 13. I no longer have the constant underlying guilty feeling of doing something I know is not good for me

 14. My lungs and overall health feels amazing

 15. Not having to visit dealers every few days

 16. Not having that constant nagging feeling of a depleting stash

 17. Appreciating small things in life that seemed meaningless when I was high all the time

 18. Creativity comes to me more naturally

 19. More productive at work and not constantly clock watching thinking about when I can next smoke, which actually makes the day go quicker

 20. I feel much more present and mindful"
"Nearly 4 Years Clean As I approach this time of year I always think about when I finally made the decision to quit relying on smoking a plant every day to feel ""good"". I think I would have fit in as your typical stoner. I smoked for 8 years daily, always when hanging out in my friends garage, playing music or countless hours on my PC playing video games. I thought it made these things I loved so much better. I thought anyone who didn't get high and listen to the Avett Brothers live vol 2 was really missing out. It felt so critical to my enjoyment in life that I never imagined I would stop. 

One morning I woke up, and in a total light bulb moment I decided I wasn't going to smoke. I didn't need it today. I dont know what made me do the next step, but I packed up my stuff and ran to drop it in my trash can literally as the garbage truck was 2 houses away. I felt a sudden calmness, and of course some panic, as that trash bin dumped into the truck. Still standing in the driveway the next thing I did was delete all my dudeman phone numbers from my phone, and thus started a new life. I decided to try some new things, escape my comfort zone, and just a few weeks after I quit I met someone exciting. 

Since then, I've gotten married, bought a house, got a few promotions, and now have a beautiful daughter. I love all of my hobbies even more than I did when I was smoking. I am more focused and have a clearer mindset on life and the person I want to be. I quit simply because it wasn't as fun as it used to be. I outgrew it. Something we all eventually do. The choice is yours in the end on when its time to move on.  

Good luck to all of you out there, and always stay positive."
I've gotten into drawing much more since I stopped smoking a few days ago. It has a weird way of stopping time similar to pot. I drew me. I'm proud of it. 
"30 days today...longest sober period in over three years. Today marks 30 days since I last smoked weed. I've been a regular user for over 5 years, mostly every evening as soon as I could after getting home or finishing up with work. Been lurking on this sub off and on for the last two years and even posted some small successes on my previous attempts (under a different account). This time I intentionally waited 30 days until posting because I didn't believe I could actually do it. 

I haven't gone this long without smoking in a very long time, so I consider it a real achievement but I'm cautiously optimistic. At first it was very tough as with previous breaks but now I don't have many cravings, just battling fatigue and more recently an intense guilt for not being able to stop sooner. It feels like my life was on auto-pilot for the last five years and I wasn't doing things for myself but rather what others expected of me. I was a fully functional stoner because I convinced myself the bare minimum was good enough to get by in life. 

Having this clarity again for the first time helped me realize I was never a ""just get by"" kind of person. Slowly but surely my motivation and drive are coming back but definitely not 100%. 

Over the last 30 days I've continually come to this subreddit and just read posts whenever I had cravings or thought about giving up. It's amazing how just reading about completely random strangers struggles that are so similar to your own can motivate you. For that, I want to thank each of you for sharing and helping others. 

Not really sure where I was going with the post but thought I'd share the milestone and some of my thoughts. I guess I'll say keep up the good fight. Keep coming here for motivation when you feel like giving up and know that there's complete strangers out there rooting for you. 

Positive vibes!

Edit: Thanks everyone for the replies! I'm glad I can offer some words of encouragement and I'm super proud of you all for continuing the fight. Let's hit the next big milestone together!"
"I FINALLY GOT MY APPETITE BACK! Guys. I can finally eat without throwing up. 

Oh my god, this is incredible. I never thought that I would get over it, but I did. I can finally EAT! 

To anyone experiencing loss of appetite, you will eat. And you will get better. Meal replacement drinks saved my life.

Just thought I’d share this because I’m so happy. I thought I was going to die."
"There are a LOT of hours in the day when you aren’t stoned. A. LOT. First sober weekend. House is spotless, errands are run, even the cats have been brushed.

I feel like an ass complaining about boredom but...I’m doing it.

EITA: Title should be: Day 6: et al."
"I wish I never tried weed I’m 28 and have been smoking chronically for about 10 years. There have been so many times where I’ve said I’m going to quit, or at the very least play that “maybe if I just smoke once a week” game in my head, yet I always end up relapsing back into daily use. I have a serious love/hate relationship with weed. When I’m sober, I wanna smoke really bad. Yet when I’m baked, I wish I had stayed sober. The weed buzz is really nice, but along with it comes with a long list of downsides: Anxiety, depression, laziness, fear of conflict, fear of death, way more anti-social, inability to focus on my studies, munchies, need more sleep, lack of motivation to do shit even after the buzz wears off...

I’ve actually cut out a lot of bad habits during the Covid pandemic, and I’ve therefore been really proud of myself...mostly. I’ve been smoking less (up until the last couple weeks), I’m drinking less (granted I wasn’t a big drinker beforehand either), I quit jacking off, I quit caffeine, and while I still eat meat, I’ve incorporated more plant-based meals into my diet. And I’m starting school in two weeks for my M.S. in computer science. That said, I just can’t see myself being as successful in school as I want to be if I don’t cut weed out of my life entirely. I don’t even think I can be one of those “just during Christmas time” or “just during my birthday” people, because then it will be the only thing I think about all year. I wish I had that kind of control, but I’ve proven over and over and over that I don’t. I don’t even think I can drink, because my desire to smoke increases tenfold when I’ve been consuming alcohol.

Fuck man. I wish I never tried weed."
"Day 4. Irritable and miserable but putting the anxious energy into cleaning and Christmas. I’ve accomplished more this morning clear headed in 3 hours than I have the past 6 months combined. Weed adds to the anxiety and depression for me, that’s the bottom line. Stay strong my Reddit leavers. "
"I know this Reddit is primarily for weed; but yesterday I decided to stop smoking meth. Some pretext is that im 21 years old; first started using at 15 and this is my 3rd and shortest relapse lasting a little over a month (August) with as little as 26 hours of sleep across the entire month while working a 9 hour shift 6 days a week at a restaurant that often does 300 covers in one morning. 
I have completely and entirely drained my body of any nutrients its been clinging to and I have started to feel the most intense withdrawals the likes of which I've never experienced so harshly. I would love some kind words and support from my R/leaves community.


thanK You all for the kind words; i take them all very seriosuly and have helped me get through the work day that much more. I really needed this; thank you.




Update 10/12/18; 42 days sober and going strong. No desire to return.  Thank you all."
"My very strange milestone🙄 Today a reached 4 months 20 days sober.

Stopped in may 6 and my main motivation was to get that freaking brain fog out of my head and I succesfully won.
In that stoned days, having to think difficult things ever resulted in scapism, its a pattern I see in the ones that smoke, we only want to go throught the way of entertainment...

Life isnt yet a bed of roses for me, but really help to be totally aware of my situation and not numbed.


Also everything I try to learn my mind register.

For example: I started to study video edition with a very hard software called Adobe Premiere.
In this program IT IS A MUST to remember dozens of  keyboard shortcuts that makes our workflow economically viable to be a professional editor.
Now I ask: would I be able to learn so much in less than 2 months I kept smoking: absolutely no.

So its being so much better to be sober, even when I have cravings I remeber the slime-minded I was before...

Hugs from Brazil"
"16 years of daily smoking, to day 18 of sobriety... I'd never have believed it. It's possible and you CAN do it. I'm about to finish my 18th day of sobriety from weed. 

I'm going to bed with a full stomach and I'm on the second chapter of a book (I never read and I can even partially remember chapter one!). 

I have smoked north of 3gs every day for 11 of those 16 years, bar 2 when I was stuck in a hospital for a week - I had some delivered for the remainder of my time there. 

18 days ago I read the threads on r/leaves and they inspired me so I want to share my experiences so far and I'll be brutally honest. 

ITS THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE. It may also be the hardest mountain you ever climb but it's possible and its f$%k%&g worth it.

I've had two real phases so far.

1st: 

10-12 days of utter misery, depression beyond anything I've ever experienced (I've been in residential therapy before due to PTSD and this was worse). The anger and rage was unreal, the lack of sleep was physically painful and I resigned from my job in a tantrum and cut off life long friendships for good. It's unbearable and heartbreaking but each day I didn't smoke, or give in and I woke up feeling slightly more balanced. 

There were 48 hours when suicide was the only option I saw feasible. On these days, I took diazepam (Dr's orders over the phone) and slept. Perhaps I cheated but the alternative would have been worse- But... I didn't smoke. 

There were other symptoms I experienced but everyone is different.

Phase 2:

In the last week I'm definitely more irritable than I was when stoned but I'm calming more, day by day. My appetite is returning, and I've slept two nights for 7 hours now without it taking an age to get there. 
My sex drive is non existent and headaches are pretty overwhelming but my physical craving for smoke has 99% passed. Finally. I still haven't had one dream/nightmare though...  

I can say that today I have 'seen a light'. I feel like I can think more and feel more (in a good way). I'm excited about life and my future. 

If I'd given in and smoked, or hung myself, I'd never have seen this 'light' which I'm confident will help me through the rest of my recovery. As deep as it sounds, it really is so real and possible that anyone wishing to quit, no matter how long you've smoked, CAN. 

I've got a long way to go yet and I'm sure there'll be more phases as I progress to gaining my life back. This is new territory for me as a man and no longer someone hiding behind a joint. 

One thing I'd say helped me the most:

Whatever you feel, however dark and physically unbearable, DO NOT GIVE IN, no matter the excuse. Be it succumbing to sadness and smoking - DO NOT SMOKE and I promise, it'll get brighter. The first week, two weeks, might even even be longer for you, it will get better.

Now it's looking like I'll have my job back, and I can start to think of a wider plan. It's a tiny step in paying back the pain caused to myself for over half of my life but it's the beginning. 

I hope everyone going through this journey feels empowered by this community and I'm really excited for anyone getting their life back. 

You can do it. It is possible and your life will be the way you feel it should be. Its just that first step to see a brighter you and cut that shit out of your existence. 

Good luck r/leaves fam- I'm excited for everyone here and send you all the power and courage I can. 

You'll do it.

"I'm sorry At some point in the past... Was it a year ago? Maybe two? I came across this sub or one like this, where all participants focused on giving up weed. I scrolled through the titles, thinking something in the lines of ""wow, these people clearly cannot handle their weed. Maybe it really is not for them"". Myself, I had no intention of quitting. I knew it was slightly inconvenient to always think about having enough, always chasing the high, but I knew I was not like these poor souls who need to quit to feel better about their lives. People who let weed ruin them. I knew people who would become paranoid and very affected after one puff, so they had to stay sober. I used to smoke bowls while hanging out with them and feel so in control of myself. I thought it was those people who end up addicted and miserable. 

But I was different, was able to handle it well, I was ""cool"". Ha ha ha. I had other interests besides weed, scholarly, artistic, athletic pursuits and refused to believe weed was changing my ability to perform them. 

I'm sorry. My judgment, even though never outwardly expressed, was a real stoner thought process. 

Recently after quitting few other habits, I clinged on to smoking weed, because it was a relationship for life, I assumed! Slowly but surely it became clear the substance was stalling me, impeding my growth and rhythm, affecting all aforementioned interests and results thereof. Putting a wall of smoke between me and people, smokers and non smokers. Obscuring the experiences and connections. 

In the emptiness caused by not being high I can catch and recognize many more thought forms flying through my consciousness and not fall into a self perpetuating ganja loop. Had a puff the other day and really felt it... 

I became like those kids who can't handle their weed ;)"
"Woke up feeling okay Last night was really hard. I was angry and wanted to cry. i made dinner for my family and hated it, no flavor despite them liking it. Hubby was standing in the kitchen wrong (wtf does that even mean??). Just a horrible night. I really wanted to give in and just be happy.

I didn’t though, I cleaned my house, played with my kid, snuggle my cat. Knit a sweater I started last year for my husband to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, I didn’t realize I could angrily knit lol! I’m almost done with it now!

I couldn’t fall asleep until 1am and daughter woke up at 3am because of the storm. I fell asleep on her floor while holding her hand and comforting her. 

Despite all that I woke up feeling okay. My eyes are super funky but I made it though a rough night. Thank you everyone."
"The struggle you feel today, will offer you the strength you will need for tomorrow. Keep pushing forward, don't look back. You can do this..you can. "
"I think we should breakup... I think we should breakup.

I want a different life. 

I don't know exactly what that looks like now, but if I stay with you, I'll never know my full potential.

This isn't easy, and a part of me will always love you.

You alone, were there at my worst.  For that, I thank you.

I'll never forget you.

But I want to move on.

I want to think all my thoughts without your influence.

I want to feel all my feelings without your fog.

I want to know just how bold I can be.

What is my limit?  How far can I go?

I do not know, but I am excited to find out.

This is my adventure, and you are holding me back.

That is why I've decided, to break up with you.

Goodbye."
"If you need to DM me for extra support I'm here. No matter how many days, months or years you've been sober, support is necessary. "
"Everything’s going to be ok. This is a sign, you’ve been looking for a sign and this is it. You’ve been through a lot, and i’m proud of you.

edit: love y’all, this was from the soul. and it was meant for you."
"My day was ruined my weed yesterday My friends and I all had this extravagant day planned. As soon as I woke up, I ate breakfast and headed to a friends new apartment in a major city. We were going to drink mimosas and watch college football before attending an MLB game at 7pm. Around 2 o’clock, they convinced me to rip the bong. 

I used to smoke everyday for 2+ years. I took some time off and eventually ended up “quitting.” 

I ripped the bong and my day was ruined. I was in a sleepy/dazed state until I went to sleep that night. I felt like shit at the game. Even before we left for the game, I was half asleep. 

I became lazy, unaware, and antisocial because of weed. This awesome day we had planned was ruined by my inability to just say no. 

How did I used to function off weed..? *I probably didnt* but now that I’m living sober, I can actually realize how much it was fucking with my powerful sober mind."
"I just wanted to say thank you to this sub for a different reason This is one of the few places on the internet that does not preach weed as a miracle drug. All of your heart-wrenching stories have stopped me, as someone who recently graduated high school, from falling down the rabbit hole. I know the purpose of this sub is to be a support group for those already affected, but, as someone who has tried weed and owned a pen for a while, the stories on this sub have helped me nip it in the bud (pun intended) before it became a problem. Thank you and keep fighting"
"We should stop saying “I’ll quit tomorrow”, here’s why. I see at least one post daily saying “I’m quitting tomorrow”. I’m 44, been smoking weed since I was a teen and the only thing I’ve learned about quitting is it just doesn’t happen that way. 
There’s a reason you (we) keep saying tomorrow, and that’s because you didn’t quit today. Tomorrow always seems like it will be the easy day to do it. You’ll wake up refreshed, focused, motivated and ready to quit....right? 

A whole lot of tomorrows have turned into yesterday’s. And that means a whole lot of failed quitting days. It adds up in your psyche.  The more you feel like a failure the more you use to cope. The more you tell yourself you just can’t quit. 

Instead tell yourself you need to quit. And maybe you’ll do it tomorrow or maybe the next day. And maybe it takes a while. But hopefully one day soon you’ll wake up and tell yourself that it’s today. 

For me the first day is and always has been the hardest. I never know when that day is coming. It’s always a surprise. Once I get one day under my belt I know I can do two. On day 3 today. 

"
Write down how you feel before and after smoking. It usually isn't how we expect. Look at this writing every time you feel like relapsing. This has helped me a lot. 
"Why I Quit (High Binge Eating) I don’t have any contempt towards weed, or anyone who smokes. I still have a lot of friends who continue to smoke and I respect them.
I quit for a multitude of reasons, none too large or theatrical. To be honest about it, the overeating was the worst aspect of smoking.
I know overeating is typically joked and characterized in the cannabis community, or even at them, but for me it turned into a serious issue. When I was high, or in that post-high haze, I’d crave, and crave only, junk food. Sugar, trans fats and processed to a shred.
If I could smoke and maintain a healthy diet, feeling no urge for junk food, I’d probably still smoke. I’d ask friends, “how do you smoke and NOT get hungry for 2 large dominos pizzas?” Each answer was different but not significant enough to change my eating habits. Even if I encouraged myself to eat carrots and water while smoking, the cravings would always return.
I’ve felt an unbelievable amount of benefits since I’ve quit smoking, but that’s a post on its own. My point is, THC-induced binge eating was not some funny stoner stereotype for me, but a day-ruining consequence that could only be stopped in one way: cessation of smoking altogether.
If anyone can relate to this feeling, then I’ll feel accomplished in posting this."
It’s been 3 weeks since my last toke and I haven’t looked back since. In that time I got my motorcycle license and lost 10 lbs 
"I’ve been a “stoner” my whole adult life... Hi friends! I’m hannah. I started smoking weed when I was 15 years old. I was excited to try it - I had heard it helps with anxiety and opens your mind, both things I wanted very much. It quickly became a daily habit. I do believe it helped with my depression for awhile, and in other ways I think it fed into it. I am now 22 years old. I still smoke regularly, feel extra anxiety if I don’t have weed on hand, and get quiet in social situations. It kills my motivation when I smoke during the day. I know I can do MORE with my life. I could be a better me without it. 
My mind though is stuck on the excuses. When I crave it or feel poorly I find a way to get it. I honestly feel like an addict with weed, and I am. 
I’m ready to let go of that identity. Any support appreciated!"
My nan commented about how much better I seem. Day 25 and visited my nan on the way back from an audition and she commented on how much better I look and how I seem so much more extroverted again. She knows I’ve been battling with depression and bipolar 2 (which are getting better thanks to meds) but doesn’t that the main reason was because I recently quit weed. Hearing that from her made me realise how much it really was affecting me and my personality as well. Felt like a pretty big win for me.
"Took me 10 years to get clean for 1 month. Here I am. It’s incredible what perspective a sober mind can provide.  Yea, I might not be as fun or social.  I’m not as exciting to be around, nor do I find as much excitement in life.

But I’ve had my most productive 4 weeks at work and got assigned to a really incredible opportunity.  I’ve paid off $5K worth of my $20K in credit card debt.  I’ve rekindled my relationship with my parents.

Weed made me so apathetic that I buried myself in debt and surrounded myself with toxic people.  I was having an INCREDIBLY FUN TIME BEING HIGH!  

But after several paranoid, sleepless nights, I finally found the courage inside me to make a positive, yet difficult life decision.  After 10 years of daily use, I’ve never felt better or more confident than I do today.  I’m genuinely enjoying my sobriety.

I’m ready to live again."
"Feel like a 17 year old in a 21 year old guys body. I spent the last 4 years in my room taking dabs 247 ,  I lost all touch with reality for that period of time. I am trying to reintegrate back into life but I feel like I’m an imposter trying to play human."
I’ve been smoking blunts daily (not exaggerating) for over a year. I started when I was 15 and now I’m 16 . I stopped smoking today because I’ve noticed an extreme change in myself (not as active) . I want to quit for at least 6 months to show myself I’m not in need of THC. Please support me. 
"Quit weed July 22, 2006, still going! Quit-iversary today marks 14 years WEED FREE!
Cannabis might be a substance that most people can use without getting addicted; however, for a small percentage of people (roughly 9%), it can become really hard to quit. I appreciate the ""protection"" the cloud of cannabis offered me through my youth. But when I attempted to use it in moderation, I was always gradually drawn back into daily use. These repeated failed attempts at using in moderation continued for 10 years. During a weekend workshop (in which I had to be sober for 24 hours before and afterwards) I was finally able to see that my excessive cannabis use was keeping me timid and withdrawn. My circle stayed small, due to the fear of the unknown. I stayed ""self-medicated"" in that comfort bubble for too many years. 

I finally stopped altogether on July 22, 2006.
Today I celebrate 14 years since I set down my cannabis crutch.

I now have the first-hand knowledge that my life is more courageous and inspired. I feel proud to be free from the haze of weed."
"I cant take this anymore I am so lost in this life.  I toked at 14 to cope with the abuse and the bullying. I was close to jump from a high building around that time. Just sat there looking down on the world that hated me so much. Smoked the first joint a few days after and found something that made my life simple. I could take the beatings and the horrible shit that was on the daily.

I found a way to survive, as long as i had weed i could manage. So life became about gathering for tomorrow and escape for today.

Somewhere around in my twenties i got jacked and hold at gun point at a time i was very high. I have never felt that afraid and the high just vaporized and stood clearheaded in panic. 

Few months after i started hearing voices.  Thoughts that was not mine, commands that i did not think. I quit cold turkey and spend 2 months isolated from ""friends"". Was very hard and horrible to go thru. 

8 months after i got clean more or less i had life under control.. Well more than i had in may years. Started a education, talked to a nice girl. Got away from my abusive mother and thought life was about to change.

It did. My spine had some kinda ticking time bomb illness so out of nothing i found myself with chronic pain.  I could not cope with the reality that i had fought that hard and went thru such withdrawals and horrible memories of the person i had become thru the weed and hate towards the world.

I lost my education chance, the girl was nothing i had thought and ended alone in apartment with no other than my abusive mother to help me.

I was never taught how to be out in the real world as my mom kept on fucking with my head thru narcissistic games, perversions and guilt to keep my head locked in some weird shit. Told me such horrible tales and lies and started fucking with every last piece of what i had left out in the real world.

Found myself in such a hole i could no longer take life. Could not sleep, could not maintain. So i toked..Just once. And just like that i got pulled in the escape again. I lost my mind and my will to live. I just wanted to die. 

So i took a chance and tried to kill myself. Got locked in an asylum and stuffed with various drugs that ended up frying my brain in such a way i haven't felt myself ever since. Went in and out of this horrible place a few times until i had enough.

Everything in my life was shit. I was around 200kg. Fat, fried and fucked.

Took up the fight and started loosing weight. Lost over 100 kg. Was winning again. Was gaining myself again.  Then my back got worse and all the shit was crawling thru the walls and i fell in the weed big time again.

Government fucked me over and let me rot on welfare as they did not want to help me so i just kept on sinking in the depression. Weed started to become the only reason to get up. The only reason to exist. As i just wanted to die. Years went by that way. Just stoned every day all day. I wanted to die.

So i got up again and fought my way out of the shit again. Quit the weed. Found my life spark again aaaand.. Just like that i got hit with nerve infection that caused me to feel pain i had no idea existed.

They put me on so high doses of morphine i fried my head even worse. I wanted to die again. I started toking mad again and just hazed thru the day. 

So few weeks ago i reached 40. Meaning i have been sick close to 18 years now. With nothing to show for it. I want to die. To get away from this shit..These few people that does nothing but get me drugs and keep me down.

Few weeks ago i finally find a connection with somebody and i start to feel again.  But i am a mess and i yet again must realize i do not fit anywhere in this world as i have been locked in this apartment for nearly half my life. World goes on..Very fast. She could not return the feelings i had.

I feel every time i toke i get paranoid now. Get these weird reality perspectives that i cant seem to place anywhere. I cant seem to find myself anymore.. What is real..what is paranoia.. What is anything anymore.

So i started to cut down on weed. And again every toke is causing my mind to fly right off in bad paranoia and feeling people are going to hurt me.. Did that car follow me.. 

I tried cold turkey but smoking that much for that long is causing withdrawals and pain to get worse so what ever i choose its fucking horrible.

I cut down over the last few weeks and i am 4 days sober today. I cant sleep. Pain is horrible.

Depression is hard atm and all these things i have been thru and mind games and sexual advanced from my mother is really messing up my head.

I cant take this shit no more. I just want this to end. 

What the fuck shall i do?. I am so far away from reality and myself

It is like every time i get close to something good my life just takes a turn for the worse.

Sorry for the text wall and thanks to whom ever reads this. 

SBM."
What my Day 7 looks like :) 
I’m on Day 1 I have quit smoking plenty of times. But today is a new chapter to my life. Please welcome me with open arms and all I ask for is some support and I will do the same for you guys. 
"Hard for me to believe, but today is day 1000 So after being a daily smoker for over 25 years, today I can say I have not smoked in 1000 days!

It definitely wasn't easy at first, but I rarely even think about it anymore.  If it wasn't for the app I use (cleantime), I probably wouldn't have even realized it was a thousand days. 

Stay strong!"
"I’m finally ready to take back my life - 32 hours and counting Last time I smoked was 32 hours ago. I’m done. I’m finally done with weed and I’m happy and scared and nervous. 

Physically I feel weird, mentally a bit the same. Almost like I’m a bit empty. Plus hot and cold chills. 

After 15 years of being a pretty much daily smoker, I’m done. 

I’m a performer trying to get my business going. And three days ago I sat down and made a list of everything I needed to do. Then I flipped back through my notebook and found a page dated two years before. On it was the exact same damn list. I’ve wasted my talent and potential for 15 years. No more. 

Today is the day I take back my life."
"Day 64. Amazing things are happening in my life. It's probably just all coincidence, right? I still think about it sometimes. But far from every day.

Since I quit weed I have also quit cigarrettes.

I have been working out regularly for a month.

Lost 3kg and become a lot stronger.

Developed stable sleeping-habits. Stopped spending **any** time in bed between waking up and going to sleep.

Picked up several old hobbies that I want to improve on. Painting and drawing mainly. (I've been doing it daily for more than 5 weeks. Seeing improvements make me proud and happy.)

Re-found my joy for cooking.

Only ate healthy home cooked meals.

Fixed pretty much everything broken in my apartment. Got new furniture. Decorated my walls.

Meditated every day for 6 weeks.

Become much more productive at work (software developer) and found joy in developing my skills further.

Been happy. Not constantly. But that's not what we're aiming for, is it friends? We're aiming for happier on average, happier more often, healthier, more honest. A trajectory towards well being. I wish all of you best of luck and courage!

&#x200B;

\*edit\* Thank you for your kind responses! Here's a link to part of my story before. Just in case you feel the need to check out what kind of hopeless delinquent could still manage to turn things around. Just like you are able to.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cjhkz2/i\_want\_to\_share\_a\_bit\_of\_my\_story\_with\_you\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/cjhkz2/i_want_to_share_a_bit_of_my_story_with_you_as/)"
"I lost the love of my life tonight, due largely to the fact that I smoke pot. It's time for a change. So as the title states tonight my fianceé left me due in large part to my smoking. 

I smoke all day. It's the first thing I do in the morning and the last thing I do before bed. I use it for chronic pain and to help keep me mellow. I'm a naturally angry person I use pot to help me cope with other people and I realize that's a huge problem, but it helped so much for so long that I'm terrified about who I will be without it. I'm looking into getting a therapist to help deal with that side of myself, but I digress. 

However much good it did me, it has done so much more to ruin more than one of my long term relationships. I just get so lazy and stop caring about the little things. I stopped helping out around the house and would neglect to do important things cause I decided to get stoned as soon as I woke up. I justified it as it being my way to relax unwind
 from the shitty jobs I've had, but it's gotten to the point where I do everything stoned.  

I have these huge dreams of owning my own recording studio, but I always find a way to stop myself and I think that's due to being so nonchalant all the time and not striving for more. 

I've lost the love of my life, with no way back, because of the consequences of smoking a plant and who it's turned me into. I would give anything to go back and never start smoking pot. 

Here's to Day 1.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your amazing words of encouragement. I am definitely doing this for me because I don't think I can take another heartbreak like this and it's the second long term relationship that my smoking had affected and I'm just ashamed it took me so long to see it. I wish her the best, but as much as I want to, I can't let myself think there's a chance. I get my expectations set so high, that when it doesn't work out I fall into deep depression which definitely won't help things now. I've got a sober tracker on my phone now and I'm going to do my best to check in regularly. Y'all are the greatest. Thank you so much."
"Learn from my mistake I quit for all of 2019, I knew I had pushed my weed use to far so I committed to not smoking for a whole year. When 2020 hit I wanted to try it again so I did in January and it’s late May now. I kept justifying my use and saying it wasn’t a bad thing but it was. and now I’m back on Day 2 off weed. Really bad nausea all day today and no appetite. But I’m fortunate to have gone through this experience before and I know what’s ahead of me. First 2-3 weeks are going to be hell but even when I’m uncomfortable and feeling sick, I’m happier sober because I’m way more articulate and less nervous because I’m readily available when work needs me. And I’m just happier. I love life, as oppose to when I’m stoned and I’m trying to escape. 

I love you all, this community has been here for me in the past and I’ll always be here for anyone struggling with their sobriety"
Withdrawals lets you know that you are healing. Don't let the brain trick you. 
"I got pulled over tonight and it didn’t ruin my life I am 1 month 2 days sober.  I got pulled over tonight and it went very smooth.  I had a headlight out and got a warning. That’s it.   

If this had been a month or two ago I would have definitely had weed in the car.  I’d probably have been smoking a blunt.  This would have meant possession charges and a DUI.  This would end my career.  Make all the hours I’ve put into school worthless.  But, that didn’t happen.  Because I’m sober.  I’m so lucky. "
"Don't smoke once you start feeling better, it's a trap. I've been working out and doing productive shit for a while now since becoming sober. I had an intrusive thought come up 'Maybe since i'm feeling better I can smoke a little and it won't hurt'

Don't do that"
First day sober after smoking for 5 consecutive years! Let's to do this!! # First day sober after smoking for 5 consecutive years! Let's do this!!
Said NO to my bro when offered Joint. omg this is the best day yet...I said no to my smoking partner in crime. He is my oldest brother who I smoked with the first time ever. Right now I am triggered and want it bad but the toughest part is over.
I’m the Kobe of Quitting 
"Weed was the cause of my depression 3days sober, finally figured out that weed was the main cause of my depression. Haven't had any panic attack's or any withdrawal symptoms yet but keeping myself busy with games and gym. 
Finger's crossed hope i can hold on."
"Cracked one month !!! Let's get it, I cant believe I've made it this far !! "
"I have officially passed the “number of days before you break a habit” 22 days!!! I have passed the 3 week mark!!! I’m so much closer to being a nurse now that I’ve graduated, got my license, and started getting clean!!!! Living in a non-legal state is frustrating, but I’m taking it day-by-day and I am so thankful for sobriety today!!! 

My future pediatric patients deserve me to be at my very best, and I am getting there!!!! :-) I can’t wait to get back in the hospital to love the sick kiddos the way I should have been loved throughout my childhood. 

Today is day 22!!!!!!! 💙"
"I just flushed the rest of my weed down the toilet. I was gonna keep playing the “when i finish my stash game”. 

It’s tearing apart my relationship. Part of me regrets flushing it. 

Another part of me knows it was the right answer. 

I regret flushing it...
I’m in for a rough week."
I created a graph that shows my levels of satisfaction when using weed and when sober. 
"I always fail on day 17 it happened 3 times already, well today is day 17, I got rejected by the guy I love but I won't smoke weed. "
"Bong -> Vape -> Edibles -> 1 week clean! Im a 25 year old guy who started smoking at 13 years old. For as long as I can remember weed has been a big part of my life and there’s been many months where I’d do smoke every single day. 

Weed definitely hasn’t ruined my life or anything, its been more of a blessing and a curse. I graduated 2 years ago with a degree in computer science but was unfortunately laid off due to COVID a few months ago from my first software engineering job out of college. Since then weed has slowly crept more and more into my daily life.

It got to the point where I was taking hits from my bong every day and while it wasn’t as bad as when I was dabbing multiple times a day in college, I could still feel its effects on my mind and especially my lungs.

I decided to buy myself a nice vaporizer a month ago which definitely helped me feel a bit healthier. However, even vaping is still bad for you and so two weeks ago I switched to purely doing edibles. However, I’ve now been unemployed for about 4 months and am not receiving as much unemployment funds from the government as I once was.

I need to start taking my career and health more seriously and for this reason I decided to stop doing even edibles last weekend. It’s been nearly a week and I can feel my brain starting to get sharper and my body having more energy. Hopefully soon I’ll get my life back on track and I’ll find a job I love.

Looking forward to continuing this journey. Best of luck to all of you!"
"Every day ends with ""I need a joint"" When I get home from work, I'm exhausted and unmotivated, the only thing I'm feeling is this crazy craving. My mind is telling me ""I NEED this, YOU need this"".
It's all bullcrap. I don't need it. It's just going to make me feel the same tomorrow because I wouldn't take care of the things I should.
To heck with this stuff..."
"I used to look down on posts here - yesterday I flushed a bag and threw away my grinder and accessories. Today is day 1. After about 10 years I've decided to do a full stop. Had a good year so far and almost only smoked with friends and didn't bring anything home, until about a week ago. I told myself that I'd be able to manage just smoking on the weekends. What a fool I am. Of course it ended up being every day. I hate how I end up going behind my wife's back and sneak around for this shit. So yesterday I flushed it down, threw away the accessories and cleaned out everything. No more! Just had to share with someone.

Edit: wow this sort of blew up over night! I appreciate your support and I'll make sure to go through all the comments after work today. Thank you all :)"
"Two and a half weeks in, I was having a terrible day at work, and my coworker offered me his dab pen... ...And I didn't accept it. I've been having some really bad days recently and honestly would love to smoke so much, but I refused. Small steps are incredibly important everyone, and even when you are upset or just get that itch, just remember you're working on improving yourself.

Any step is a good step, so keep it up fellow Leavers!\

Edit: Thank you all for your responses, they mean a bunch and help keep me grounded and on the correct path. Keep it up everyone!"
"If I quit drinking, I can handle this! "
"4 days weed free after 4+ years of heavy smoking I really had cravings today, called dealer ( who always will deliver in the next 30 minutes )  and decided to cancel the order 10 minutes later"
"Self respect is back Looking in the mirror at myself and knowing that I am the master of my fate. Lungs finally opening up again after 10 years of extreme abuse (tobacco/weed). My brain is okay but my throat feels all cut up and so do my lungs. On day 4 I believe and feeling like a man. A man with will power that can change the world for the better. 

Give me support guys, this is my one millionth time trying to quit. If I go back again, I might lose this new found hope.

Love you guys. You are great people."
"Techniques for regulating stress and anxiety when quiting cannabis. I wrote a quick comment on the question of a fellow leaver, which migth be helpfull to other members of this community. So I copy/paste it in this post:

&#x200B;

Hey, I'm a leaver and psychologist - psychotherapist that specialised in psychotraumatology.

Quiting weed often disturbes the neurological inhibition and stress regulating systems. The brains are accustomed to quite a massive inhibition from using weed, so the normal regulation is disturbed. Leaving weed behind initially forces your brain to auto-regulate again and reach a new balance. Initially this seems to cause a further imbalance. This is paired with a hightened stress reaction that comes with stopping an addiction.

Therapeutically, I usually aim at stabilising my cliënts and learn them to stabilise themselves. There are multiple  techniques and self-soothing skills that you can aquire on yourself, to prevent or attenuate the normal reactions you now have.

Classic and well know are breathing techniques. A good, slow, deep ventral breathing can allready help a lot. A specific technique is called heart-coherence. This kind off breathing synchronises your breathing pattern and the fluctuations in your heartbeat/-rate. This improves the connection between your symathic and parasympatisc neuronal systems (i.c. the neocortex and your 'reptile brain'). This allows your brain to auto-regulate your emotional systems by your frontal cortical system. The disruption due to stress and a disturbed inhibition system that causes anxiety and  depersonalisation can be prevented or diminished this way. Practicing heart coherence for 5 minutes improves this connection up to 4 hours. Training this regularly (30 minutes a day for a month) even lets this coherence to become a new habit so you experience this continually.

There are mobile apps you can use for this. There are some which offer auto-feedback due to heart-rate monitoring. Some use the flashlight of your smartphone to monitor bloodflow in your fingertip. You can also use apps that just propose a breathing frequency that fits most people, they work well too. An alternative is just to put up a youtube video for heart coherence. Most applications let you breath in when a ball goes up and breath out when a ball goes down. Using deep ventrical breathing is not required but can improve the effects in my experience.

Other than that, there are a lot of normal healthy habbits that can help regulate tension. Walking, being attentive to nature arround you, a good hydratation, the company of a good friend...

Good luck on your journey. It's not about winning, it's about learning and finding a new way to live life that suits you best."
"If you're back to day one, read this, it might help We learn something from every attempt to quit, it's not a failure as such but a learning curve. Instead of thinking 'I've failed, this is day one again', look at the percentage of time you managed to go without. Being without 99% of the time is better than smoking everyday. 99% better

Personally I don't believe in counting the days as it's something that draws us back to the thought of 'I can't have it'. A better narrative is ""I don't smoke weed"". Using can't requires will power, replacing with don't requires no will power at all. 

An even better narrative is 'I'm living a healthy and productive life"" and remove all thoughts of weed completely

You got this!!!!!!!"
"Longest streak in 5 years, tomorrow is day 11. 5 years ago I almost quit, I went out of town for a whole week to Denver and on my last day there, 7th day sober, I relapsed.  Then I proceeded to fly home and smoke it up like nothing was different even though a week prior I had smashed all my paraphernalia and sold all my drugs.

I got back to town, hit up a dealer, got some papers, and started smoking joints.

Well now I'm going on day 11 after almost committing to quitting 5 years back.

It's surreal.  I'm trying not to dwell on how I almost quit back then and instead just focus on the now and how my mindset has changed.

Weed isn't for me, and this time I'm sticking to that mindset!"
"Two weeks in, tonight I experienced a feeling I haven’t felt before. After 17 years of smoking almost every day (13-30 years old) I decided it was time to move past my addiction. The first hundred time I tried to quit I was weak and let myself go “just one more day”. Upon recently finding out my third child is on the way, I told myself I need to do better things with my life and recognized that weed has been severely holding me back. My house has been “lived in” (my way of excusing the mess caused by me being lazy) for as long as I can remember, never dirty but unfolded laundry in baskets and dishes in the sink most of the time. I spent a time throughout the day tackling small jobs around the house, each one giving me motivation to start on another. Once my laundry pile was almost finished, I looked around and could see an empty sink, clean bedroom with my bed made, and almost all of the toys in the house picked up, and a sudden rush of endorphins came over me. For the first time in a long time my body gave me a huge dopamine hit from feeling accomplished, even when I would have a clean house in the past I was too stoned to feel anything other than tired and ready to smoke another bowl. I don’t want to call this a high for what I feel are obvious reasons, but this feeling is amazing and wanted to share my experience here with y’all. 

TLDR: I got my first endorphin rush from cleaning my house today, never felt so good from something that was typically a chore when I was using!"
"I am 100 days sober and it is my 24th birthday Today was such a good day. I got a call that I am through to the final rounds of interviews for a job I really want. 

I was so scared taking time off work for my mental health would ruin my career that's just starting. I even felt okay that if it was a rejection call I would handle it well. 

I used casual sex and weed to escape my pain, and now I face it head on and I feel so strong and purposeful.

I know theres going to be more trying times. If I get this role I will be in a very male dominated environment, some people may even smoke to release stress. 

My parents still have there struggles, and my brother still tries me with his issues. But this year I am focused completely on me. My happiness and career is my focus, I can think about dating again when I have created a beautiful life for myself.

I am so grateful for this community, I have relapsed before- now I have found this page and want to stay apart of it forever.
Stay strong everyone, letting go of the addiction pays off."
"5 years without weed and just found this sub! / AMA I'm a 26 year old guy in the UK.

After (nearly) 5 years of clean time two things are true - my life is immeasurably better and I still think about smoking weed almost daily.

Finding this sub is amazing; I haven't been to a group or meeting in years and didn't realise how much I missed the peer support.

I took drugs from the age of about 16 and after years of abuse this culminated in a few episodes of drug induced psychosis and residential care at an addiction treatment centre. 

Weed was always there, every, single, day. It was the last thing to go back in December of 2014. 

2015 was the worst year of my life. I had no idea what to do with myself, how to sleep, how to eat, how to spend time with friends, how to regulate anxiety and why did music suddenly sound so boring? But there were some silver linings...

I didn't have to worry about running out of weed, I didn't have to wait for unreliable dealers, I could be around my family without them being scared of me, everything became much much simpler.

Over the next four years every single element of my life has improved. My relationships are better, I'm more confident, I go to the gym and have a good job. I'm closer with my family than ever. I eat well, rather than having only one meal a day which is invariably a greasy takeaway. I can hang out with friends when I want and on my terms - without being that weird dude on the periphery that pops outside every couple of hours to smoke. People experience me as a much better person to be around. Also music sounds good again.

Getting free of weed is a fucking tough journey. And it's going to be horrible for a while. Just hang on to those silver linings and enjoy being free of all of the trappings of active addiction. Once you break the back of it everything will improve.

I thought people towards the beginning of their journey may have questions, which I'm more than happy to answer!

Love to you all - the world is a much brighter place once you win your battle!"
"I did it! Triple digits, baby! "
"Tomorrow marks 1 year for me Wow. Can’t believe it’s been a whole year since I last partook. Hope you guys are having an awesome day! 

Edit: Thank you so much for the gold!!"
"""If you're this stressed out about whether or not you should smoke, it's probably not a good idea."" Wise words from my wife. Long context: went through heavy pot-head phases in my twenties. Stopped buying for good around 27 but frequently smoked with friends. I really fucking like being high.

Now early 30s. Stopped altogether when my daughter was born. Didn't want to be high around her for many (hopefully obvious?) reasons. 

So I made it two years and didn't socialize much being a new dad and all so avoiding it wasn't super hard. Then a few months ago I played video games with a group of friends who always smoke. I decided the risks of smoking were minimal. Smoked. Played games, messed around on friend's DJ equipment. Not gonna lie, it was a blast. 

BUT... When I got in my car I was like fuck I'm dumb. I forgot how tense driving high could be for me (friend lives in a narrow street cars parked on both sides neighborhood) and what if I'm in an accident, even if it's not my fault I'm potentially really fucking up my life. Also we had new management at work and what if they drug tested? It happened at my wife's company! Also what if my daughter is randomly sick and I'm stoned for that?! I just felt so dumb that I put my desire to have fun over the security of this amazing life I have. Nothing bad ended up happening but I felt like a bad dad for even tempting fate like that.

So fast forward to another party a month later. This time wife is with me and is sober and drove, and our kid is with with the grandparents for the weekend, so less reasons against smoking.  Our friend alludes to the fact that he's gonna be smoking weed on the porch soon and my heart seriously pounds. I wanted it so bad but I knew I'd feel dumb for doing so later. I'd just annoy my wife with my high behavior, stay up too late eating junk food, and then I basically would be an occasional smoker which, knowing my history, could lead me back to stoner territory. 

We left pretty soon anyway and I walked right past the smoker on the porch trying not to think about that enticing smell. I vented my anxiety about it to my wife in the car and that's when she wisely said, ""If you're this worried about whether or not you should smoke, it's probably not a good idea.""  

Thanks for reading; it's been on my mind for a while. I guess this is a ""relapse"" but I'm done beating myself up about it.  Weed is not an option for me anymore. Period. Done. It's like an allergy. 

It is hard but you can do it too. You are stronger than a plant!

Edit to clarify: when my wife said this I wasn't just saying what a bad idea smoking was, I was also saying how it wouldn't really hurt anything and in this instance was pretty low risk. I was bargaining with myself because the urge for that strange giddiness weed gives me (the vacation from my default self) was and will probably always be strong.

I'm happy people say my story helped. Remember to fast forward the tape before your next puff. How will you feel after the initial ""fix?"" "
"Partied sober, loved it. Coworkers always go out on Friday nights. I've always hesitated to go because whenever I did go, I wouldn't have a great time and then I'd spend the weekend after reliving every moment of partying crutinizing anxiously for fuckups, embarrassing things, firable offenses. Generalized anxiety disorder is a bitch.

But tonight, I committed to staying sober and trying the whole Friday night thing. Took advice I saw here - everyone else is relaxed and drunk, so no one will remember or care that I'm not as long as I relax and enjoy myself too.

It was amazing. Laughed a lot, drank seltzer, turned down offers of blunts, pens and gummies. Sitting on the train home without a care in the world.

I like this brave new world. I think this can be the new me. The happier me."
"One week today. The cravings have stopped and I feel more motivated and energized than I have in years. My emotions have stabilized which was the side effect of withdrawal. I still have trouble sleeping and night sweats but those too shall pass. For anyone struggling at first, it does get better "
"Weed Is Not Good Or Bad Hi I'm new to posting. I've been trying to quit weed for about a year now and today my therapist dropped some knowledge on me that I thought I would share. When I'm about to decide if I'm going to smoke, I hear a voice in my head that says something like ""You know, you really shouldn't do that. You really should go do something productive instead."" Well today I realized why that voice doesn't work. 

There is no ""what I should do"". There is only what I want to do. Deciding to smoke weed is not an objectively good or bad choice, it is either an effective or an ineffective choice. What is my goal? To have a stable career in the near future? Then weed is not a very effective choice to get me there. But if my goal is to get high, then catching up on reading is not the effective choice. 

When I felt an urge to smoke this afternoon I asked myself what I wanted. The answer was I wanted to stop feeling overwhelmed by my responsibilities. Getting high would temporarily allow me to escape that feeling, but long term it would have only made things worse. The more effective choice was crossing a few more small things off my to-do list, and turning in early so I could actually wake up tomorrow feeling well-rested. It's crazy how much pride I felt after making that decision. 

The problem with classifying weed as a ""bad"" choice, is it invokes a 3rd party arbiter of right and wrong. Who is this 3rd party that has decided weed is bad? Society? My parents? God? Sounds exactly like the type of people I LOVE to rebel against. I'm actually the type of person who gets pleasure from doing the ""wrong"" thing, and still making it work. 

What I realized today is quitting weed is my decision, it's a choice I want to make, for the future I want to have. I think this motivation will last me a lot longer, because I trust myself more than anyone. All I have to do is be honest with myself. Is this choice leading me to where I want to go?

Good luck y'all. "
"3 months no weed!! Hi all.
Today marks the day I have been 3 months without consuming any Thc! Feel great in myself and far more clear headed. I still have residual anxiety occasionally and nightmares /messed up sleep pattern but other than that all is good :) :)"
"I made it 24 hrs without smoking, hurray! I know it’s not much, and I’m still eating infused stuff to avoid the withdraw that I’ve experienced before, but this is the first time I’ve been able to stay away from actually smoking. It’s not much, but honest work!  :D"
"Day 1 and I'm a mom Hello, I am 40 and have been smoking pretty much daily for the past 6 years. At first it was a way to wind down after work and after my son (now 9) was in bed. It was away of coping with the end of my marriage too. But it has turned into something completely different.

I now smoke when I wake up, before going to work, after work, sometimes in the middle of the day if I am home. I smoke before doing housework (toking and cleaning used to be so much fun), before cooking meals, before bed... You get the picture. I am what some would call a  functionning pot head.

I have realized that my relationship with cannabis is not healthy. It controls me and it has negatively impacted my life. So yesterday, I threw everything out. 1/4 oz, my pipe, papers, etc. 

My main motivator is my son. I don't want him to take it up. He's so smart and has so much potential. I want to protect that beautiful mind and I want to be an example to him. 

I am apprehensive about quitting over the Holidays, but I would like to start 2020 with a clear(-er) mind. Plus, there will always be a good reason not to quit now. 

Pot is legal where I live and it is so easy to get. I have a dispensary a block away that is open 7 days a week. Reading your stories has been helpful and I am sure it will continue to be. 

Thank you and wish me luck."
"3 months sober from weed. What I've learned Smoking multiple times a day can be just as bad for your mentality as any other hard drug. ""Weed isn't addictive"" every addicted stoner says. Some people can handle weed and that's fine. But most people cannot. It's not the worst addiction to have, but when it cuts into your funds, kills your motivation to do anything but smoke, and makes you paranoid and anxious 24/7, then it's just as bad as any other hard drug. Just because you won't die from it or experience physical harm doesn't mean it can't hurt you mentally as much as other harder drugs."
"Your Thoughts Are Repeatedly The Same When Smoking. Day 7 and I've noticed finally a HUGE benefit. 

My thoughts for the first time in years are not a repeat of the same bullshit. 

I remember reading, thoughts are formed by neurons firing electrical signals to each other. However neurons tire out quickly and need to cool off. So your neurons take turns stepping up to the plate and firing away for some time before resting, and when rested neurons return to fire away you get new thoughts.

The problem is when you smoke weed your neurons never rest. Weed keeps your neurons firing and firing. It's literally frying your brain but more so trapping you in a loop of the same bullshit thoughts. 

I can finally say I have a still mind. For example, before if I had something to do I'd think about it for hours and days repeatedly,  which just created procrastination. Now I've noticed I don't think about pending things anymore and just do them because I'm not trapped in a constant loop of thinking about the same thing I need to do for weeks.

Anyone feel the same? Also, not suffering any depression. Def moody but am thankful because there's a lot of posts about depression here and that scares me! I think it's an individual case bases."
"Two months out of vicious circle. Feeling strong and motivated. Never going back. Hi everyone, today is my two months sober. I am 34yo (M) and I used to smoke every afternoon/evening for almost 16 years. Not much, but very regular. I managed to finish university when high, to get a good job and to function almost normal in everyday life. At least I was thinging I am doing fine... BUT I was addicted and don't be mistaken - mental addiction is serious and is ruining your life same way as any other addiction. I planned my life exclusively around weed. I had to be at home every night to smoke and I was thinking all day about the great relaxing feeling after I finally light my joint. I always needed to have enough in my stash. I could't travel abroad (and when I did I had severe anxiety). I constantly worried to be stopped by police when driving. I havent felt good emotionaly, so I knew I need to stop smoking - and that was another starter of my anxiety, because I felt like I cant manage even one day without the beloved weed. I convinced myself I need it to cope with my emotions. And most funny - I tought I need it to be happy. Now it seems to be eons ago... because I have stopped and broke the vicious circle. 

First two weeks were hard, thinking about weed constantly. But these thoughts slowly faded, and at the end of the third week, something in my brain changed. Suddenly I felt free and I knew I dont need weed to live. I started to be happy without reason. Riding in my car, feeling the sun on my face, listening some good music and smiling. It was one of the greatest feelings I had in very long time. Genuine happiness, not induced by any substance, but coming from inside. I knew this is the life I want. Nothing is better than to be connected with your real emotions, even the bad ones. Every situation is manageable better with my head clear.

What advice would I give to anyone that wants to stop? The hardest part is before you quit. Weed has great power to lie to you that it is impossible to live without. That there will be only sadness and pain. But once you decide to stop, the weed loses its power and you realize it was just bullshit. That you're much better off without it. 

Good luck everyone!"
"Treat weed like it’s your Ex Remember before you got in a relationship with an ex, you were most likely fine and enjoyed your life and hobbies. 

When you first broke up, oh boy did it sting, and suddenly all you could think about was every single positive thing that happened and suddenly they were an angel walking on earth that did nothing bad to you. 

Then, some times goes by, a few weeks... months... and eventually you realise not only are you fine, and happy again.. but realise that you were not meant to be with that person - clearly otherwise you wouldn’t have split up.

Of course this doesn’t correlate in every aspect, especially if you got dumped, but if you got dumped then that person wasn’t the one and you’ve had to deal with it and move on.

Weed is like a comfortable but not healthy relationship, where you’re clouded by the positives and ignore the negatives. Try and remember any negative feelings or experiences you had whilst smoking weed and use that as motivation to stop. 

For me, I can remember being paranoid that I was doing things to hurt my friends, or even just making up crazy scenarios of how anything in my life could go wrong. I also remember the times where after a long night of smoking, I would feel so incredibly ill, my throat would feel all closed up and tight.. and I’d wonder why I’d bothered getting so stoned - yet go back to it the next day.

Think of your wallet!!! I’ve realised over ~5 years smoking that I’d spent close to £25,000 on weed - and not to mention the silly amount I’ve spent on food at the same time.

Remember the times before you got into smoking and remember that there is a version of yourself that doesn’t need to be high.

Big love."
"Yay Day 69! Had to post this because I’m still an immature child, even sober lol "
"I used to think I couldn't handle life sober, but now I see that sobriety is the only way I can handle life. When I was smoking all day, every day, I couldn't handle life on any level. I was an escapist to the max. I needed to be intoxicated at all times, and when I would start to slip in to sobriety, I would need to be intoxicated again. I was scared of being sober. I was a slave to marijuana. 

Now I see that the *only* way I can handle life is in sobriety. The only way I can go to bed on time and wake up on time and do my school work and be accountable and honest and true to myself and not hurt people all the damn time and to handle minor inconveniences without freaking out is by being sober. 

Sobriety has granted me a serenity that I could have only dreamed of. The kind of serenity that I thought only cannabis could give me. 

I used to smoke because I didn't like myself sober. I thought I was too loud, too annoying, too human. So I would smoke that away to dull myself into a zombie. 

I don't like zombie me anymore.

I love sober me. "
"I never realized I was waking up “hungover” every day (Day 8)

Weed “hangovers” are very real. I smoked for so long (6 years) that I didn’t even know the crappiness I woke up feeling every. single. damn. morning was because of weed. The difference in waking up is like night and day. I can’t even express how amazing it feels to wake up with such a clear head and not feeling like I just want to sleep for the rest of the day. I’m so happy the brain fog is lifting! 

Stay strong friends! "
"Two years!!! I'm sober for 2 years today. I can't believe how much my life improved.

I'm no longer obese, I've lost 24 kg (53 lbs) in those 2 years. My health improved exponentially, so did my mood and overall feeling about life.

I'm no longer sedentary, lingering in the couch like I was before. I became a strong swimmer and a bodysurfer. I ride pretty nice waves and I'm having the time of my life. I travel to the beach almost every week in order to seek that awesome feeling, this is what drives me now.

During the week I swim, lift weights sometimes, walk the dog, diet hard, everything in order to bodysurf better, always thinking about the next session in the sea. 

I've never had this kind of drive in my life, pot had stolen all my dreams and goals, I used to just want to smoke and sit in the couch, play videogames and eat, it was really depressing.

I've recently even found a way to not hate my job, that's not an easy task, I don't exactly like to work, but I guess now I see thing from a practical perspective. I feel like a full grown adult for the first time in my life. Life is not all joy and comfort, it's struggling and survival, and it's a privilege to have some hapiness in between all the struggle.

I could say I'm a completely different person now, but I'm pretty much the same guy, just an improved version of the same guy. My wife couldn't be happier about it, and it makes me proud to have been able to be better for her.

Recovery made me feel proud about myself in life, with a feeling of accomplishment and peace.

I hope everyone can find this peace in recovery, and I'm here for you if you need me.

Thanks for reading, stay strong!"
"I made it to 2 years Last time I smoked weed was March 29, 2017. I smoked almost everyday for about 7 years. For anyone out there struggling, I am living proof that you can and will get through it. Life is so much clearer, and I’m finally living the life I deserve. If anyone ever wants to talk about anything, message me. Much love y’all!"
"Day 5 without weed, and I just got rid of ALL of my pieces and product. I have never felt so free; I am finally in control of my own life! Happy Saturday, friends! :) "
"Advice for a teen quitting? I didn’t know what to put as the title, sorry lol.
I’m seventeen year old girl and I started smoking over the summer. It started when a bunch of friends of mine came over and we took a bunch of edibles and fell asleep while watching movies. The next weekend, we hot boxed my friends car while taking edibles and drinks. I loved the euphoric feeling and the calm feeling. As someone with bad anxiety, and an enneagram type four, I thought it helped a lot. But now, I feel like I’m wasting my time with it. I don’t connect with people as good anymore and I’m even more reserved. Everything I go do I wanna do high. I get high before every meal. I get high before I go to watch a movie with friends. It just feels like I’m cheating myself with being so dependent on it. I feel like I don’t appreciate life as much with it, like weed is consuming my thoughts and time and emotions. I don’t know if I’m making sense, sorry lol. But yeah, does anyone have any advice on quitting, whether it be cold turkey or weening? Or at least cutting back? I stay high almost 24/7 so I don’t know what to expect or how to handle it correctly"
"Weed saved me and I’m so mad that I have to leave it behind I have struggled since 2013 to stop drinking. On January 4th I will have made it one year sober. That’ll be my 32nd birthday. I fully credit cannabis with getting me away from booze and saving my life. I LOVE being high. I love not having hang overs and not saying hurtful things to people i love and only hearing about it the next day. I hate who I am sober. I am just a trauma filled reactionary controlling neurotic fearful angry thing. When I’m high, I laugh so hard I can feel my stomach constrict tight and it feels so good. I don’t get mad at my dogs for doing normal dog things. I let people touch me and feel more willing to cuddle with my wife. That all goes away when I’m sober. 

The problem is that I’m not living any life while I’m stoned. I sit on my couch and watch the same shows I’ve watched over and over again because I know the plot and I don’t have to pay attention. I time my edible on my drive home to hit me as I’m taking the dogs out.

So i gotta stop. Even though I feel like I’m betraying my savior. It’s 4am where I’m at because I’m dreading not having any weed later today"
"Appreciation post for my mom, for not giving up on me "
"My GF and I agreed to abstain together. She gave in today, but I won’t. We were going to hold each other accountable for the first two weeks as an incentive to stick to the path. She was going to lay off the heavy alcohol and cigarettes, I was going to stop smoking weed. Its been 6 days so far.

Today, I get home from work and she’s fully dressed with her coat and shoes on, in bed, with her headphones on, totally passed out drunk. She bought cigarettes too. My first instinct was to say fuck this shit, grab the bong that I packed away and go to town. In spite. But why would I do that? I would just be giving up. I’m doing this for myself, for all of my relationships and my own happiness, not for some pact. Maybe if I can keep going I can show her whats possible.

Just wanted to rant. Everyone stay strong! 💪 
"
"Made it one year today after 30 years of smoking. Just a quick note while I am home for lunch.  If I can do it, you certainly can.  It has been hard to get to this point, I still have intense cravings, and it would have been easy to just give in and smoke, however, I am not a slave to my addiction anymore!

Thanks to all here who supported and encouraged me through this past year weed free.

One day at a time x 365 = One year free of my addiction."
"Sober me fiends for weed, high me regrets smoking weed Lurker here for about two weeks whilst trying to kick my addiction for weed. I have been smoking regularly about once or twice a day for the past 3 years. Does anyone else find that somehow while they are sober, they convince themselves to smoke. Shortly after, regret settles in and I become so motivated to quit. This has happened almost every single day that I have tried to quit so far. I just trashed my pipe today after the regret settled in. Hopefully I can stay away for longer this time. "
"No Weed Day 60 , No Fap Day 17 , Cold Showers Day 10 , Meditation Day 7 Hey guys. You may see my story on my previous topic. Here i am on day 60th. I will never ever go back to smoking again. Wake up with fresh mind is priceless. 
I have lost couple of friends but seriously i do not care. My new life is much much better than before. I nearly got over about my ex. Now i'm more energetic, happier than before, my memory is much much better :) about no fap i'm doing well i think. Started cold showers 10 days ago. Im starting to get use to it and it feels amazing.
7 days ago i also started meditation with ""headspace"" app. 
Still i cannot focus but i will not stop trying. I have used pot for 14-15 years. It will sound cliche but if i can do it you can do it aswell ! Please just do not stop trying !

"Just want to stop by and say thanks to this sub and all its users This is probably the most supportive, welcoming subreddit I know of on Reddit. Everyday dozens of people share their stories and nearly every post has at least one comment offering words of encouragement or advice. There’s practically no bullshit, which is rare for Reddit and the internet in general. Over the years I’ve related to so many stories and found solace in the fact that so many other people are working to better themselves. This community has helped me improve my physical and mental health and allowed me to share my experiences with substance abuse in a safe, anonymous way that is otherwise unavailable in my day-to-day life. None of this would be possible without the integrity of the users. So thank you all, and stay safe."
"Walked to my local pot shop and started crying All those wasted years, job opportunities, relationships and most of all time. Sitting and watching fail videos or some other time mindless BS. I dont want to be in that position again. Thinking of being in that position again with no future made me cry. That's when I took the time to cry , mediate and then walk my ass back home. 

On the way I realized that I'd rather jump off a building than live with myself as a pothead. My mind is finally healing and just the thought of being a vegetable burned me to my soul. I want a mind that F**KING WORKSSS.

I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS WAY BEFORE. I immediately came home to watch an episode of Brooklyn 99, ate a pbnj sandwich. Now I am in bed. I have a tear in my eye just thinking about how glad I am for not smoking today. #1dayatatime"

"I'm committing to a weed free January. For me, that's a huge change. This post is to hold myself accountable, and for anyone in a similar boat to me. Let's do this This is gonna be so difficult but I'm serious about trying a change"
"Everything is going better. I'm on, I think, about a month and a half. And literally everything is better.
I started a business and it's finally taking off because I'm actually putting effort into, rather than doing one hour of work, convincing myself I had made a great progress and I deserve to get high. There went the rest of my day.
Then last night something super awesome happened.
I met a girl. And not just any girl, she's amazing in just about every way, well to me anyway. Everything I'd have wanted. And it went great. I was able to talk, make jokes, laugh, not zone out, and she ended up being more than just interested in me too. We spent the whole night and most of today together, and moved our next plans up to Tuesday because it went so well. Its been so long since I've been excited by someone.
Success guys, success all round. High five.

"A letter to Weed               I do everything for you. I missed the bus for you. I ditch my college classes for you. I leave home early for you. I sometimes look like an idiot in public for you. I buy extra food for you. I cry for you. I cry about you, because you’re mean to me. I spend a lot of money for you to just give me a little, just a little... high. I want you soothing me, making me feel good. Before, I wanted you to leave me alone for all the stuff i’m doing for you. Couple weeks but not forever. Now, I just want you out! I want you out of my life, You clingy bitch. out of my body, out of my personality! You are taking me away from my life. I need to go to school and pass, I need to take care of my body, I need to be with my family more. I need you to leave me alone. I’m so weak."
"Day 355 sober after 15 years high - Life has never been so good I just realized that in 10 days I'll be 1 year sober. Haven't been here much since the first month or two but I don't think I could have made it through those first couple months without leaves.

Since I quit, my life has been amazing. It took a few months but I got the job I've always wanted. Then I realized I hated that job, so instead of rolling over and giving up like I would have in the past, I applied to a different job and was hired the very next day. Now I love what I do and am excited to go to work most days. I still struggle with some insomnia but it's getting better, in fact I fell asleep last night on time and woke up an hour early this morning, which is why I'm posting here!

A month ago I met an amazing man and have ended my 5 year single-streak. I didn't have to limit my dating pool to fellow stoners. It's still new but I feel so lucky to have found him. I wouldn't have even made the effort to meet someone if I were still stoned all the time and the idea of hoping he'd accept me if I were still reeking of pot and needed to bring my bong and baggies to his place every time I went there is cringeworthy. I think I'm falling in love and it feels amazing. I didn't feel this way in the relationships I had as a stoner, I didn't feel much at all.

Life is good. It feels like stoner-me was a lifetime ago."
"I ran out of weed last night I woke up this morning and tossed my grinder and other paraphenilia in the trash. I don't want to go back anymore, I've 'quit' so many times. I hate the up and down the back and forth. I am going to make this the final go. 

My wife and kids deserve it, my bank account deserves it, my work deserves it, but most importantly I deserve it. 

Here's to 2018."
"The Weed Routine  Weed works its way into people’s lives in different ways. Take this example:

*Here’s how my life has gone for the past 7 years. Get home as quickly as possible. Light up a bowl soon after I walk in the door to get high. Pet the dog, feed him, then walk him (after I’ve taken a few more hits, and feel sufficiently high). Turn on the TV and crash. Order in, or cook something simple from the kitchen. Avoid my parent’s phone calls. Get high some more, browse my social media before falling asleep sometime after midnight. Wake up feeling agitated and get ready for work, wishing I could stay home and get high all day. Repeat.*

For this person, weed integrated itself as an essential part of their day. Weed is greedy—it’s not satisfied to take up just the time when you’re getting high. It makes you rush through your other activities, just so you can slow down and enjoy the high. Except when you look back, it’s difficult to see whether you were enjoying anything at all. 

When you’re high every day, it’s hard to be fully yourself, because you’re not your original best self - you’re your high self. Like a crappy knock-off, you’re a diminished version of yourself.

This isn’t the case for everyone, though. For some people, being high every day isn’t a reality they have to worry about. But it can still overwhelm your routine. Take this example:

*I’ve managed to stay away from weed during the weekdays since I can tell it affects me at my job. I mostly keep to it on the weekends, which is a great way to unwind after a stressful week. However, after a few weeks of this, I’ve noticed some things changing. I don’t see the people I used to meet up with for a beer. I’ll get the invite, but when I look outside and see it’s snowing, I just want to sit at home and unwind with a bowl. I used to invite my friends over - the ones who liked to smoke - but over time, and after being rejected, it’s just easier to do it on my own. My weekends are spent getting high - and although I put off working out, cleaning the house, or reading for my weekends - when I start smoking, it’s hard not to keep doing it.*

For this person, weed worked its way into their routine, even when it wasn’t a daily activity. Their weekends were built around weed; and even though this person knew that more needed to be done, weed took precedence.

It’s easy to build weed into your routine. The benefits are clear: had a rough day / week / conversation? Weed can help bring you back to happiness. Over time, it becomes the preferred method for calming down. It makes everything better: TV, music, art. Until it becomes the standard requirement for us to enjoy these activities. Soon, TV and music simply don’t have the same pizzazz without getting high first. The TV shows we enjoyed while we are high simply aren’t as funny or engaging when we watch them without weed. Art, which was a great way to exercise our creative energy, suddenly seems daunting and scary without weed.

Over time, you customize your body to expect the satisfaction that comes with weed. This is the beginning stage of addiction. Without it, you revert to irritability, anger, or boredom. It becomes easier to exist at 50% of one’s potential because weed makes you ok with being bored. Doing more becomes difficult because after weed works its way into your routine, it’s hard to remember how you go by without it."
"Just found this sub, and feeling conflicted. A popular askreddit thread led me here today, and now I'm having an existential crisis.  I was planning on just lurking for a while, but that seems to be pretty discouraged here, so I decided to make this post, to try and get some guidance.  
  
I've been a daily smoker for over 15 years now.  I've always had it in the back of my mind that this wasn't doing me any favors, but I would always put that thought away, and call up my dealer.  It wasn't so bad when it was still illegal, as my guy would blow me off sometimes, or not have anything at the moment.  But last year, my state went medically legal, and of course I got my license as soon as I possibly could.  This has not been a good thing for me.  I always make sure bills are paid, and my family has everything they need, but I will always spend any extra money I have at the dispensary.  I'll even say to myself that I should probably wait until payday, but my ""demon"" side almost always wins, and I end up at the dispensary again.  
  
Like I said, family and bills come first, and I make sure those are taken care of before I get smoke, but I feel like I'd have so much more money in the savings account if I could just stop buying the shit.  
  
After reading some posts on here, it did come in to my head that maybe I'm not where I want to be in life.  I have a pretty good paying job in the career field I chose, but I could probably be in a much higher position (no pun intended) if I did something more productive with my time than hitting the bong.  Then I got to thinking about my son.  How many good times and memories have I missed out with him, because I'd rather be smoking a joint in the garage then spending time with him?  He's only 7, so I feel like I really need to get my shit together, or he's going to grow up to resent me because I liked smoking more than him.  
  
I really don't know where I'm going with this post as I feel like I'm just rambling.  The fact that I'm here writing this means some part of me wants to stop. Right?"
"I quit for 7 months and was sure that I was free... oh how I was wrong [Reminder to stay Viligent!] I was pretty active over here - I was 23, had been smoking since I was 17, and had an all-day every-day habit since for six years. What made me quit? I had a trainwreck of an evening when smoking. The next day I had to give an important presentation to PhD Researchers, and I could not handle the anxiety I felt, knowing that I was ill prepared and smoking weed instead. I contacted the relevant people, told them that I was not mentally well, and vowed to get my shit together and never smoke weed again. That's what happened - for a while. I did indeed get my shit together, I removed weed from my life and was so much happier sober. Everything improved. 

It wasn't until about 7 months later that it went to shit again. I was having a music session around my place, me and some friends were making music and having some beers. By this point I had become over-confident and would happily hang around weed smokers, sometimes I would actively choose to go and stand around people smoking weed just to prove a point to myself, to demonstrate my will-power. Anyway, this guy at my place was smoking a joint, he even told me he would be happy to smoke outside as he was aware of my situation. I said no it's fine, and having a few beers in me, started this classic and cringe worthy thing of 'Well it has been 7 months, I think I deserve a cheeky puff'. My friend tried to talk me out of it but being a massive stoner himself, it did not take him long to be talked around to giving me the joint. 

The thing that scares me the most is there was an instant change in my that, in hindsight, confirms to me that I am a sucker for this stuff... an addict, dependent, whatever you want to call it. But as soon as I'd had a few puffs, my friend went home. The three puffs weren't enough - I had got a taste for it, and I wanted more. Almost immediately I phoned my old dealer for a 3.5. It had been 7 months, I expected him to be like 'Oh my godddd man where have you been, I missed you sooo much' or whatever. No, he didnt even notice I was gone. This is going off track a bit but just remember that your weed dealer makes a lot of money from you... just because he acts like your friend does not mean he has your best interests in mind, don't get attached. 

That night, as I said I called my dealer for a 3.5. The maddest thing is I even ran down to the 24/7 garage and bought 30g of tobacco! By this point I had quit cigarettes for 3 months as well, and I happily threw this down the toilet. 

By now it must be pretty obvious what happened... I rolled a joint, which turned into several joints and cigarettes, which turned into more joints and cigarettes, which brought me to 7 months later, right now... feeling depressed, unmotivated, lethargic, lonely and regretful again.

My biggest problem with weed is the wasting of time. I have always been one for a bit of an existential crisis... if a quarter-life crisis exists, I am having one, and I imagine I will be a sucker for a mid-life crisis in the future. Age upsets me, I get attached to the idea that I have so much potential but I am wasting it with weed. It hurts me thinking what I could have become by now if I never had picked up weed. But who the fuck knows, maybe it's all part of the journey... 

Anyway, the main point I wanted to express right now is that you should never stop being vigilent. After 7 months I was sure that I was over this, yet it inevitably brought me back to the exact same point that I was experiencing the previous year. 

Don't get over confident, stay vigilent, and always remember why you are doing this."

"Your symptoms are your 'fake friends' Depression, Anxiety, No Appetite, Brain Fog, Insomnia, Nausea, Cold Sweats: theyre all your closest buddies right now.

Because they dont give a fuck about you, they just want to get high and eat all your food and watch shitty movies and shows on TV with you. But hey, you dont care, youre just happy to make others happy, so you keep on smoking to keep your friends around.

Then comes the day you decide to finally quit weed, and they cant seem to stop harassing you about it.
""What the fuck man why arent we getting high right now?""
""Come on lets chill dude!""
""Dont be such a pussy weed isnt addictive youre just being a bitch about it!""
theyll say to you. When they notice you havent smoked for a few weeks, No Appetite, Cold Sweats, Nausea and Insomnia get up and leave. What a relief, three assholes out of your life for good, thank god, you always knew they were such dicks.

Then theres Depression, Anxiety, and Brain Fog, the three others who still hang around because they believe that if they play their cards right they can get you to start smoking again.

They know theres someone in there that will give in to temptation. Theyll try to remind you of it every now and then. Theyll make you think about all the good times you guys had getting high back in the day. Theyll even stick up for the assholes who left you a while back, claiming that you were the problem, not them. God damn, these guys are hard to ignore. But maybe they know whats best for you, after all, theyve stuck around the longest.

Part of you wants to smoke again just to stop them from prying at your emotions, and another part of you wants them out of your life for good. So you continue on without smoking, yet they keep on setting you up for failure. After having a bad day, they tell you ""Hey, if you do it every once in a while, its not so bad.""

You dont disagree, and you figure its been a while, so why not? You smoke and before you know it, youre back to smoking every damn day again. Back sitting on the couch, surrounded by all the fuckers who ditched you at the drop of a pin, just wasting the time away getting high. But now you cant stop thinking about how much you fucked up by relapsing just that one time. You realize how much Depression, Anxiety, and Brain Fog got to you.

You quit again, and the same thing happens as last time, the same four assholes leave within a few weeks, and the other three stick right by your side.

This time around, you know the games they play, so youre prepared.

They dont get to you much at all this time, because youre distracting yourself with hobbies, making new friends, achieving your goals and spending all that extra money you earn on better things instead of weed.

As each day passes, they become less and less clingy, and start to lose hope in getting you to smoke again. Eventually, Depression, Anxiety, and Brain Fog finally agree to say ""fuck this, youre a lost cause"" and leave you alone, and this time, its for good.

You did it, it took you a long ass time but you got rid of all those negative influences in your life and replaced them with positive people and things. They tried to stop you in your path but you stuck to your guns and did it. Now, a year later, youre glad that you quit weed and wouldnt trade it for anything in the world.

"100 days without Cannabis I’m proud to say that I’ve gone 100 days without smoking, ingesting, vaping, or any kind of Cannabis in my system. I feel like myself again after being addicted to weed for over 5 years. I love my dreams that are very wild at night. I love the feeling of being witty with my jokes. I absolutely love that I don’t have the urge to smoke a bowl to get on with another task. It’s rejuvenating to go day to day with the best intentions of making the most of my time whether exercise, working, reading, drawing, cleaning, and eating healthy. I always knew I can go for months and months without needing weed. I can’t wait to return months later to this supporting community of Leaving Mary Jane in the past. Till next time, friends. Stay in the light."
"How push ups helped me overcome weed addiction Greetings from the heart to everyone,

I hope you are coping well with the current situation, and that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.

I would like to share with you my experience of how I overcame my addiction to smoking weed daily.

Now please don't get me wrong, I believe some people can enjoy smoking weed in moderate levels. 

I believe it's all about self-awarenes, I used to run away from my life problems and issues by smoking it because it helped me to relax and forget about everything (just while being high).

I started to consume more and more to reach the high level that I needed and here is where I have realized.... there is a problem.

I have tried many methods to stop, which worked for a while, but in no time I was smoking again.
 
Until I came up with my own method.

First, you need to truly commit that you will do whatever it takes to STOP and that you will not lie to yourself.

Every time your brain starts thinking about that addiction (weed in my case) and how nice and relaxing it is use the Mel Robinns 5 second rule (if you don't know it check it on YT) and immediately do push-ups (as much as you can) until your muscles can't hold you anymore.

Now let me explain this so it will make sense to you. 
You see our brains are created to protect us, to makes us feel comfortable and happy, therefore it will always remind you of the things you felt good about.

Let's take here as example relationships and breakups... why do you think you feel miserable and you miss your Ex so much? 

Because your brain can tell that currently, you are feeling sad, but it doesn't recognize the reason, it only knows that it's linked with your Ex, so it will start memorizing all the good times all the moments that you shared together (the happy ones ofcourse) which will make you miss her/him more.

Our brains don't recognize that it's bringing us more pain than pleasure.

Sounds stupid right? But the brain did that to protect us from sad feelings without knowing that it makes things worse for us.
 
That's why YOU NEED TO steer, control, manipulate (whatever you want to call it) your mind (brain) for your advantage.
If you let it work on autopilot it will destroy you.

NOW, when your brain is thinking about that specific addiction and you start doing push-ups (any kind of exercise, Plank is also good) by repeating that, your brain will link that addiction (which felt great before) with PAIN! negative emotion.

Make sense now? 

When you repeat that everytime you think of it (for at least 2 weeks), trust me your brain will not remind you of that addiction no matter what, and you suddenly will feel greater willpower.
Because again your brain is designed to make you feel good, and pain will make your brain avoid that in any cause.
You see when you go to the gym you are pushing your limits, you are getting out of your comfort zone, that's why in the begging your brain will resist it until you start to see actual physical results which takes time.
On the other hand drugs, alcohol, porn and masturbation will provide you the same feeling, but in a faster way.

Once you master it, you will feel great about your accomplishment.

I hope some of you will find that beneficial and I wish you all good luck.🍀"
"To anyone who's successfully quit and gets a thought of 'just treat yourself', it is the addiction speaking, it is NOT worth it! I've been here so many times. So many 'I feel lost' posts, so many 'I need help' posts. It took years for me to finally cut the addiction and stop daily smoking.

But recovering also meant a lot of other things revealed themself. Yes I started being a TONNE more productive, eating better, lost lots of weight. But I still wasn't happy... life was still dull and grey, a hole which I thought weed used to solve.

3 days ago, I hit a rough spot. I'm on new antidepressants which take a long time to 'take effect', and during those few months where they are getting into your system, it's not uncommon for your emotions and stability to be going up and down repeatedly. I had been free of the addiction for a good while, and thought I truly had got my control in life back. I was wrong.

I woke up one day after a night of heavy, heavy drinking. Drank so much I don't even remember the night. I didn't wake up feeling hungover, but I woke up feeling INCREDIBLY paranoid, depressed, anxious. Obviously this was all because of the alcohol, but I had a creeping thought of smoking, knowing it would make me feel better about things and stop worrying. At first I took note of it and ignored it, but through the day I just had this feeling that it was inevitable. And then later on my friend was picking up and I just caved, which has turned into me doing nothing for 3 days and spending way too much money on takeaways and snacks.

The whole time I've known this is bad and that I shouldn't do it, but I wake up and feel so terrible until I've smoked again, something I hadn't felt in a while. I'm smoking this to hold myself accountable and hope tomorrow I can get back to how I was, gonna be hard though."
"Quitting feels like heartbreak. I'm currently on day 25 and came to a realisation a couple of days ago but wanted to sit on the idea before sharing it:

Personally, the best example I can give (other than just saying I feel anxious and depressed) is that I feel heartbroken. When a relationship breaks down with someone, or when a family member passes or a much loved pet, that sickening feeling your body feels when trying to adjust to the situation is somewhat identical to the feeling of no longer having weed in your life.

Weed was that warm hug when you were sad, the thing that got you out of bed in the morning, the thing that made social situations that much more enjoyable; it gave you a reason to be happy and it was a feeling you're constantly chasing... somewhat the exact feelings you would get when you're ""in-love"". You had a bad day? Your loved ones would be your go-to, the same way weed was my go-to.

I could be put in the most horrible, awkward situations but as long as I had my weed, the same way a young child needs their mother or father, the feeling becomes less scary. Now you're no longer smoking, you're going through the heartbreak of losing something you love. The more addicted you were, the longer it'll take for your heart and body to mend and adjust to the new lifestyle of living ""single"", or free from weed in this case.

If you're reading this and think I'm chatting absolute shit then you're probably right, but in my mind, it makes total sense. I've had girlfriends in the past that I loved (I might not have been IN-LOVE with them but I loved them for sure) and the gut-wrenching feelings I would have when these relationships broke down are somewhat identical to the feelings I'm now experiencing now I'm sober.

Your body and mind are mending, and you're in complete control over what direction you want to go in with it. These things can take weeks, months or years, and there's no shame in taking longer than others. You'll mend when you're meant to mend. Sending love to everyone and hope you have a strong, fulfilled and happy weekend, no matter what you're currently going through."

Today marks 100 days since I quit smoking weed! 
"How smoking weed effects your beauty (a thread) - gives me bags under my eyes 
- gives me the munchies that result in weight gain 
- makes me care less and put less effort 
- makes my eyes look smaller and squintier 
- always look tired 

Just curious for the women of leaves to share how weed made you uglier. And how your looks changed for the better after you quit."
"I'm leaving this sub. This is a positive post. A message to you all just starting on your first day of quitting or those pushing and losing motivation.

You can do it. You have it within you, you just have to tell that to yourself over and over.

I've been cold turkey for exactly 1 year today. No more cravings, don't even think about weed unless I see it on Facebook or reddit somehow. I have improved personally and professionally more in the last year than I did in 5 years whilst smoking. I increased my income by $15,000pa and am now on my way to saving for a house. I read books, I work out and I feel I am on the path to creating a successful life.

I'm saying this to motivate you, not to gloat. I want you to realise that it is possible, I'm not special. You can do this friend. "
Stopped smoking 2 years ago and my life became a lot better 2 years ago I smoked a bad cart and almost died. Since then I haven't touched weed at all. I decided to leave. I got a very very nice job a couple months later and life hasn't been better. I have an insane amount of motivation to advance my career and hobbies like I never did before. Thanks leaves and good luck to all of you.
Just vacuumed up a decent sized nug in my car without thinking twice about it Feelin alright.
"I feel free I am at almost 3 months. Some of the improvements I've noticed are whiter teeth, no more coughing fits, more energy, a bit more confident in social situations, more focused and alert while driving.

But by far my favourite improvement has been this overall feeling of being free from the habit of daily smoking.

I no longer feel like I have to smoke before certain activities. I don't need to plan my life around when I'm sober enough to drive or get things over with so I can spend the entire day getting high.

I don't feel as ""weighed down"". It's so nice to just be able to get up and go about my day and enjoy being out somewhere for a few hours instead of being anxious wondering how soon until I can smoke again. 

It is still in the back of my mind often, but I don't crave it the way I did in the beginning. 

I couldn't do this without you all. Good luck and I hope you get to feel this too."
"Does anyone else ever call in sick for work just because you need a day? This is the first time I've done this since quitting almost two months ago. 

I used to do it more often when I was smoking because I had more bad days. Most days are good now, but the bad days are really bad.

I don't feel physically sick, but mentally I feel drained and exhausted and I can't stop crying. I don't get paid for sick days so I always feel bad about it but I had to call in anyways. I just need to spend the day in bed hugging my dog. 

Do you ever do this?"
"Insights from 23 years of being high I felt compelled to share some things as it seems many of the people here in this sub are still quite young and struggling with weed use. I’m 42 now so I’m on the other side so to speak. I didn’t have the reason or the will to ever quit weed until recently and I’m realizing how much damage it actually did to my life in the background.

I have kids. A house. A spouse who loves me. A career. I workout regularly. I take nice vacations every year and travel for work. From the outside my life seems pretty great. But after only 2 weeks sober I am facing some pretty tragic realities that have been sitting right in front of me all along.

I used to pride myself on being able to have both “accomplishments” and a daily weed habit. Until now.

What I’m realizing now that I took weed out of my brain for a short couple of weeks is that it has damaged me in really serious ways. I have deep-rooted black and white thinking that hurts me and others repeatedly in my job and in my marriage. I have guilt for being high around my kids that I used to gloss over with smoke because “hey, I don’t have a problem, right?” I have dramatic self loathing that seeps into every aspect of my life.

Bottom line, I have “woken up” after 23 years of chronic smoking to a pile of regret. Remember those dreams I used to have about my career? Things I once reached for that I long since let go of. I chose weed so many times in my life over doing the work. I chose to get high instead of work on my marriage. I chose to get high instead really spend time with my kids. I chose to get high instead of taking creative risks. I chose to get high instead of starting my own business. I chose to get high instead of calling my mom. I chose to get high and basically do the bare minimum of what was expected of me.

And now I deeply regret all the time lost.

So if you are reading this and thinking you may have a problem with weed or feel like you want to quit. Please do your middle aged self a favor and reach deep within for the willpower. Trust me you don’t want to wake up in 20 years and realize you had a glaring problem in your life all along. Life is short. And although mine’s not been truly wrecked by weed. I feel like I let it steal too many important things from me. I’m finally done. Now I just hope I can repair my brain and my emotions and my ambitions and relationships before any more time slips by.

Best to all of you."
Anyone else feel aggressively irritated? I am a little over 2 weeks clean and I am no fun to be around. It seems like my mind is finding any reason to be pissed off and I am embarrassed by how irritable I am. Help! I need a shift in perspective to get out of this hole without turning back to MJ. EDIT: Every day seems to get better and better. Thankful for this community of encouraging folks who support this fight!! I acknowledge my addicted mind but I am in control and it will not take over!

Congratulations to the Leaves who haven't smoked in 2016! 
"Don't be The Stoner After about 6 years of smoking everyday I've decided to quit. I'm only on day 3, but things are becoming very clear to me. I have let Marijuana define me as a person. 

I was always the ""high guy"" in the group. My ""friends"" would call me to smoke at my place because I had a bong. My birthday presents were always marijuana paraphernalia and Rasta oriented items. Whenever I would miss a social gathering or a planned activity people would just assume that I was off getting high. The world perceives the image that you choose to project, and my image was unfortunately that of a post-college burnout. 

The lowest point of my addiction came when I was fired from my menial job for being high on the clock. As my bank account started to dwindle I was still compelled to spend what little I had on weed. I had to move back in with my parents at the age of 24. 

I got sick of myself and knew I had to make some drastic changes. I started to exercise daily and adamantly pursuit a career that I went to school for. I picked up photography along the way and it has opened up my world. I slowly cut down my marijuana consumption and finally achieved sobriety, 3 days strong and counting. I know it's going to be hard, but I am hopeful that I will quit for good, get a new job, move out, and travel more within the next year. 

Try to remember who you were before becoming a stoner. Be true and strive to be the best version of yourself.

""Kill the [stoner], and let the man be born."" "
"The biggest myth we current and former stoners believe If you’re like me you’re probably not a big drinker.  I tried every alcohol drink known to man but hated the feeling of being hung over and totally useless the next day.  So I never really drank because the hangover was never worth it.

I thought with weed I could always wake up the next day and do every day things.  I would toke up and study, go to classes, drive, cook, go to meetings, go to work high.  Weed makes you high but still functional....right?

But here’s the catch.  Weed makes you fucking dumb.  You don’t feel your head pounding like a hang over does but you have mental fog, poor memory, and difficulty concentrating.  It is harder to learn.  To communicate.  To be present in the moment.  

It is really hard to realize the difference for us current and former stoners.  But when you go sober after smoking so much for so long you realize the hangover of weed is BAD.

And no joint is worth feeling totally dumb and useless the next day.

Feeling productive, present, and sober is better than any joint.  

If you’re craving a joint, just think of how you are going to feel, or want to feel tomorrow.  Is that hang over worth it?"
"Letter to myself. No more mediocrity Why is quitting so hard and why do we keep failing at it? As sad as it is, I am currently asking my self this question, do I want to succeed more than I want to smoke? Not knowing the answer to this question is actually terrifying. When I think about my life, I have so many goals and dreams being only 26 years old I have so much ahead of me and there is so much I want to achieve in life, but every day I also want to get high af. It is always ""I will start tomorrow"" and slowly letting my life pass in front of me while everyone else is progressing. Even though I am not a complete fuck up my life ended up being just mediocre. I guess that's what happens when you don't really try hard at anything.

I have made a decision. I will not live a mediocre life anymore. No more getting high and eating shit food all day and never exercising. No more smoking a ton of cigarettes all day that you wake up spitting black tar every morning. 

Your whole life you are told that all you need is a college degree to have successful career but now you know its total BS. How the hell do you expect to land a decent job when weed took all your social skills from you? How are you going to walk into in interview confidently? You have been smoking so much to the point that you don't even know how to hold a conversation for more than 30 seconds.

I don't even like most of my friends to be completely honest. When it comes down to attracting the right people to your life you need to have something to offer in return. If you are always too high to have fun and be engaged no one will want to friend you. Friends aside, what kind of partner do you want to end up with? What quality of woman can some stoner dude who just lays around all day really attract? The women I have had in my life are no where near the quality of women you really want.

Not gonna lie, this has been very hard for me to write looking at my life in the most honest way which can be painful. We see the everyone else's flaws easily but facing yourself can be the hardest thing. 

Not really sure why I wrote this whole thing, I guess hoping that when I'm craving tomorrow morning I can read it and stay strong. To all the people I have let down I cannot apologize to you directly but I have to say it somewhere and I'm glad for anonymity of the internet. To my parents, I am sorry for not living up to my full potential. To my sister, I'm sorry for not being the big brother you needed during your hard times. To my ex-girlfriend, I'm sorry for all the pain i put you through I wish you all the happiness. To all my real friends, thank you for staying by my side during my darkest moments. 

Day 1. Lets fucking go"
"I seriously thought weed withdrawal was going to kill me - turns out I had the flu! It's funny now, but the last 2 days have been a horrific mixture of emotions and what I thought were HORRIBLE withdrawal symptoms. I was literally sobbing in bed to my wife because I never heard of stopping weed giving a bad fever and actual vomiting. Heck, I went through getting sober from alcohol in January and it was all brain withdrawals aside from a shit ton of night sweating (so no physical symptoms). 

At some point, my wife (the brains of the operation) suggested I may just be sick. Turns out the DTs aren't trying to kill me and I just have the flu."
"Do you not know? Your spirit is crying out for you to fight to be what you were meant to be If you are here, it is because you have a thought that marijuana may be negatively affecting your life.

 First things first: marijuana is not the cause of your problems. The cause of your problems is THE SAME THING THAT CAUSED YOU TO BECOME ADDICTED TO IT. 

You may have friends that are positively affected by it. You may see famous successful individuals that smoke marijuana. I'm really sorry to be the one to tell you that you are not like them. You are trapped. You are not trapped by marijuana. You are trapped by your own mentality. If you have ever prevented yourself from becoming the person you wanted to be, I'm talking to you.

Just stop. You are worth it.

I quit 6 months ago. It was difficult and came with months of wrestling with it. But, I will tell you why it was worth it for me. 

I always wanted to do Brazilian jiu jitsu. I did martial arts over 10 years ago and have always been an advocate for it's benefits. I wanted to get back into it but never was able to make it stick. I took the step a week ago and signed up. After my first class, I was excited about it and wanted to go back the next day. The next day was a rainy cold Wednesday. If I was still smoking weed, I would have easily convinced myself not go. But I had nothing else going on. I had absolutely nothing that sounded more fun than going to jiu jitsu class. If I was smoking weed, you bet your ass that getting high and gaming would have sounded like way more fun. The fact that I actually want to go back each day is all the proof I need to know it's working for me.

""I'll start tomorrow"" or next week... Or next month.. or next year. That's easy to say when you're stoned. 

Just stop. Let yourself be bored. Only by being bored will you really gravitate to what you should be doing. 

You are worth it. Give yourself an opportunity to take a step back and get to know yourself. Contemplate."
"Refused 2 joints tonight, still had a great time On Day 5 and it’s so hard to cut out weed when all your friends smoke it daily but man does it feel good to have the willpower to refuse even though you want it. Way to go 👌"
"It's actually a lifestyle change that we're looking for It's not just the weed. It's also the fact that we won't get this auto-feel-good any more.
That's not how life was meant to be. We need to truly leave life and do stuff to feel good. We need to be productive, we need to help others, we need to work hard, we need to contribute to society, we need to cultivate our relationship, to learn, to challenge ourselves, to aim high, to cope with failures and to celebrate success.
We can do all that or we can give it all up and smoke weed.
We're hear because we chose the former.
We know deep down what we need to do.
Don't give up.
Don't run away and relapse because your work is challenging, or because your relationships suck, or because you feel sorry for yourself. Deal with it.
Stand tall and chose life. Life is life and it's eventually what we make out of it.

Today was my third day and I feel depressed.
But tomorrow is a new one, and I will make the most out of it.
I'm in UTC time zone so for me that's bed time.
Good night, looking forward to have some dreams!"
"Done I was going to wait until 2020, but I woke up today and am over ruining myself anymore.  Daily smoker for 2 years, heavy smoker for 10, light smoker for 15 (half my damn life).  I am so done being a pot head.  Here’s for a sober Christmas and a better me in the new decade."
Day 5. Wow and it’s all because of you all. I just don’t want to let you guys down. That is what keeps me going. Don’t get me wrong I do miss smoking but when I see all the love you guys showed me I can’t let you down. Promise. You guys are the real MVP. Thank you. 
I challenge everyone to find a post with 0 or 1 comments and respond! Be there for someone; show support and solidarity! 
"Riding the Wave Oh my god i just had the most intense urge to get high after some troubling news. I could have too, asked my roommate if i could have an edible, they said sure.

But you know what? I waited 10 minutes and checked in with myself again, and decided i could go another 10 minutes without one. I did that again and again and again for the last hour and a half about and the craving is gone! For now anyway... 

If you’re experiencing a craving, distract yourself, soothe yourself, and ride it out. You got this."
"I want to gift myself sobriety for my 31st birthday. I had this goal last year at 30 and wasn't able to make it. I have been working with my addiction every day since and I feel like I could be truly ready to give it up for good.  I have been a daily toker, multiple sessions, since I found weed at 16. I forgive myself for falling into this trap. I understand the how's and the why's, but now it's time to beat it.

I want my dreams back.
I want energy, vitality, memory.
I want to be able to study and retain information.
I want to feel my feelings and allow them to be. 
I want to find ways to have fun that doesn't end in bloodshot eyes and smoke in my lungs. 
I want healthier gums. I want healthier habits. 
I want FREEDOM. 

Everyone who posts here is such an inspiration to me. You all have been with me this year and I want to thank you from the bottom of my now smoke-free lil heart. 

This Day 1, will lead to Day 2 ❤️ I can feel it.

Edit: YOU ARE ALL SO INCREDIBLE!!! Thank you so much for making my Day 1, the absolutely ultimate and easiest Day 1 of my life. Whenever I get the mood swings and the ""why not toke"" again feeling, I'm coming right back here to read these comments. You are my heroes, all my love, Leavers 🥰🥰🥰"
"I finally did it. I went to Poland for a week where I knew I couldn't find any weed, and it felt so good to not smoke. I'm back home now, and I intend to keep it this way."
"Do not smoke weed to ‘help’ your mental health This is my personal experience with using weed to deal with problems or forget about shit.

So I’ve heavily cut down on weed, Lately I’ve only been smoking on the weekends which is good for me. I thought it’s fine no big deal.
I’ve started to notice the overthinking/irrational feelings again which now i realise, happened way too much when I was smoking heavily. I can really see how weed can affect relationships and work life etc. 

Also I’ve noticed that after a weekend of smoking, my work performance in the week starts of slow, then gets better as the thc gets out of my system. It really does have an effect on everything, especially if you’re a daily smoker.

It might just be ‘only weed’ but it still negatively impacts your mental health way more than you think it does. This is why I’m cutting it out completely. 

I urge you to just try 30 days without weed. Make the decision today that enough is enough and it’s time to cut weed out for good. Feel the difference in your mental health, your productivity, your relationships.
Tell me the withdrawal wasn’t worth it."
So close to the year! 
"I've been smoking daily for over a decade and I just quit cold turkey today. I think I just finally hit my stopping point. I've been at rock bottom for probably the last 5 years at least. I originally started smoking only because it was fun, but at some point it became a crutch. I used marijuana to hide from my anxieties. I would get stoned every day and night and just tell myself, ""stop worrying about it"".

At this point I'm completely unable to get a good job that pays well or even offers insurance, so I'm effectively poor. I need change, I need a good life. I can't keep telling myself, ""one day it will be legal and you can get a good job then"". No, I'm gonna be 27 in 2 months and I can't wait any longer. I wish I lived in a world where I could get high and have a good life but sadly I just didn't land in that timeline. I have to accept that and finally move on.

This is a practice in self control and mindfulness. I have high hopes that I can do this. I plan on applying my addictive personality to the positive feeling of resisting the urge to smoke. If I can addict myself to not smoking then I may just be able to trick my brain into going through with this.

Thanks to anyone who had the time to read all of this. Wish me luck

Edit: I know I've commented back to everyone mostly, but I just wanted to thank everyone again from up here. The amount of support I'm recieving is honestly a little bit mind boggling for me.  I don't know if anyone has ever supported me in any endeavor in my life as much as you guys have today alone. 

Sincerely I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Here's hoping to continued sobriety for us all.

"r/leaves and Sober October... Hi all!

Since we're seeing a whole bunch of new visitors as a result of Sober October (welcome!) I wanted to clarify our policy, as we will be modding out some related posts and comments.

Sober October is about taking a break for a month. Taking a break to reset your tolerance or re-evaluate your relationship with smoking are great things to do, but we are a narrowly focused sub for people who have made the difficult decision that they have to stop for good.

As a result, unless you make clear that you are using Sober October as your Day 1 to a cannabis-free life, we'll be taking out Sober October posts.

As I say, breaks are great if that's what you want, but it's just not what we do.

The good news is that there's a terrific group for support with taking breaks and managing moderation called r/Petioles. They can help you make Sober October a success, and if Halloween comes around and you decide it's actually time to quit for good, then you'll always be welcome back to r/leaves.

Good luck with whatever path you decide to take!

"If you put one foot in the past and one in the future your just pissing on the present. Don’t think about how much money you’ve spent or what you could’ve done with your life before, and also don’t think about a time where you might be able to smoke again, or even what the future might be for you, just focus on right now. Right now you aren’t gonna smoke weed today, and that’s not that hard. As soon as you find new activities and hobbies the present isn’t so bad, and you’ll realize you don’t need weed to be happy, but don’t worry about the future because you’re not there yet. Stay strong ~ 20 days in"
"Today marks one week sober after smoking for TEN YEARS!! I honestly didn't think I would be able to post here after trying so many times to quit smoking weed. I've been smoking for ten years and I'd say the last five I smoked all day, everyday. I just got back from a trip to Costa Rica and I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to quit smoking. The first day at the farmer's market I had to opportunity to buy weed and I didn't! The second day a few people in my group went to smoke....and I didn't go with them! So that's two bicep curls of my ""No Muscle"" and it will get stronger every time I say no to smoking!! I'm back home and there's no weed at my place and my friends know that I'm going to not want to be around the smell or sight of it still for a while. If any of you reading this have a desire to quit just remember one thing.....that is a HUGE part of quitting. Now take that desire and put it into action! This is a life change. I can't quit smoking weed without filling up my spare time with other activities. I have a hike and run planned for the next few days and I'm gonna try and stay as busy as possible! "
"After more than 1.5 years of not smoking weed (unintentional), but 2 years of daily alcohol use, I used weed to quit drinking in the beginning of March 2020. It worked for me. I am quitting weed intentionally now. I am 25. My entire adolescence I smoked weed. In my late teens and 20's I have taken breaks intentionally and unintentionally for periods of time ranging from a few months to more than a year at a time.

In the past 2 - 3 years I built up an almost nightly drinking habit. I had not tried to fully quit at any point in that time, but did significantly reduce my alcohol use at some points. Alcohol never impacted my life or got in the way of my responsibilities. 

I hadn't smoked since September of 2018, i kind of just ran out at one point and didn't feel like using weed again. But I decided during quarantine to quit drinking and enioy smoking again for a bit. 

It has worked, I've had fun. And having quit drinking, I feel much better physically. However, weed is not compatible with my mental health issues in the long term, and it is again time to say goodbye to smoking. 

Old mental problems are coming back up and messing up the good, healthy groove I had going. It took about 2 months of daily smoking for me to get back to this poor mental space. It's definitely exacerbated by being in quarantine and my usual schedule being impacted severely. 

I know I'll be able to do it as I have before, but now I realize I also need to avoid alcohol as well permanently if I am not smoking weed. I can't do any more of the switching between weed and alcohol pattern. I didn't even realize I was doing it. 

Basically all mindset altering substances, even caffeine, are bad for my mind. I literally tell myself every time I'm all the way sober after a smoking or drinking phase, ""wow, I feel so much better. Wtf is wrong with me, why do I keep smoking/drinking"". 

I wonder if anyone else here has gone through this process in this manner as well? Using weed to quit drinking, and then quitting smoking. Or bouncing back and forth between the two substances over time. 

Thanks for reading."
I’m done I just went outside and sprinkled all the weed I had in various places. I’m done. My father was an addict and I’m not going to end up like him. I’m taking back my life and never looking back
"I was able to not smoke on my freaking birthday! So I’m finally a week sober and I NEVER expected that I would be able to make it this far at all. On top of that my friends through me a birthday party last night and it took everything in my power to not smoke but god damn I did it! My fiends were actually very helpful and told me they wouldn’t smoke if it helped me and even stoped me from trying to rationalize with myself. Just wanted to spread this good feeling I’ve gotten from holding back on that extreme urge. Everyone says it but it’s especially true with me, if I can do this so can YOU!"
Anyone quitting weed because of worsening mental health/ scares? If so I’d love to hear about any of your story’s and am interested in reading other peoples efforts:)
"Day 1 I just smashed my bong and my pipes. Never done that before. I promised my wife I’d quit smoking weed when we got married, 9 years ago. Now with a kid I’ve got to change things. My confidence is gone, I’m anxious and everything fun about Pot is in the rear view. Trying to be a better person even if the irritability and sleeplessness are obstacles. Thanks for the support other leavers!"
"Smashed my pipe and threw out my weed last night Weed was just making me feel really sad. It was allowing me to perseverate on my moms death, how bad of a person I am, and just making me feel sorry for myself. 

Hopefully getting rid of weed and stopping getting high will allow me to clear my head a bit. 

I am starting new! Wish me luck!"
"It hasn't been improving, and I think I know why. I started off this journey thinking ""In a month from now I'm going to be on top of the world!"" ""Quitting is going to change me and my life!"" 

**I couldn't have been more wrong.** 

Its always been my mindset/personality. Not the weed. I'm a lazy fuck because I'm a lazy fuck, not because I would smoke (it did make it worse though). I'm unmotivated because I'm unmotivated, not because I used to drown myself in weed. I'm depressed because I'm depressed, not because I was suppressing my emotions with weed. It's all me, its always been me and I'm just now coming to terms with that on day 45 (i think?). It's gotten better, with time and hard work (if you can call watching tv for 6 hours instead of 8 a day hard work). Slowly but surely, I'm going to get through this. One tiny step at a time, and I'm going to stick to my abstinence. Why? Simply because I already have low motivation/low energy/depression and I've chosen not to make it worse by dowsing my brain in marijuana every waking minute to suppress the noise of my inner thoughts telling me ""I need to do something productive, I need to do something that makes me happy!"" Weed made me feel ok with doing nothing and allowing my life to slowly decay right before my eyes.

To anyone feeling discouraged that things aren't magically getting better, they won't ever get better by sitting there and waiting for a massive change to come around, you have to take it into your own hands and push the change along. Quitting will help tons but what will help you so much more is focusing on your mental state. I wish you luck, strength, and courage to pursue what you're wanting to achieve, no matter how big or small.

Edit: Thanks for the silver! And thank you for all the positive replies, means a lot to hear encouragement and to know that other people are going through this as well."
Gf almost died yesterday. I was high at the time and definitely less capable of helping her. We called her an ambulance. That was all the reason I need to quit for good. 
I wanna get better! 
"Quitting weed will not solve all your problems; it's likely one step in a longer process. I've been posting a lot today, but as I've been reading through the site, I wanted to share one last thought:

A lot of people, like myself, used weed to cope. I struggled my whole life with anxiety and depression, and weed paradoxically both helped & made it worse. When I quit, those problems didn't magically go away. Instead, I was able to reacquaint myself with my own mind, free of outside influence. I saw a lot of issues there that I needed to deal with. So I made a series of other life choices.

What I did:
(1) Sought out a mental health counselor for weekly sessions
(2) Started taking medication (Seroquel) that helped me sleep 8 hours a night & stabilized my anxiety a bit
(3) Started going to the gym as frequently as I could (2-3x a week)
(4) Picked up new hobbies (I started playing IM volleyball at my school, started paying more attention to cooking & trying new recipes)

I feel much better now than I did at the worst point of my addiction. *But*, I think it's extremely important to point out that *quitting on its own was not enough to bring about these changes*. It was an absolutely critical decision that allowed me to pursue the types of things that helped me more and got rid of this illusion that I was solving these problems myself through self-medication.

I also want to echo the thoughts of another post I read today. This journey is rarely a linear trend toward feeling better and better. I can look back now and say I am in a much better place, but it was not a straight shot. I hope that those of you who are committed to this also commit yourselves to other ways of addressing the health of your body & mind. Please be kind to yourself, and practice self-care. I know that many of us don't have the resources to best help ourselves (I didn't have health insurance for the first 21 years of my life), but there are many other things you can do to help improve your life, and importantly, your mental health. I really hope you all continue to work toward that <3"
"I fucking did it. I can't believe it. 1 year sober. I never thought I would be able to say I would be sober a year. Drugs have been such a huge part of my life. I used various drugs from 15-25, but weed has always been my main crutch. I remember feeling totally helpless and panicked when I would search the carpet and floors for weed crumbs; when I would run out and have a panic attack and desperately tried to think of a way I would get more; when I would get that rush of getting the baggie in my hands, running up the stairs and immediately packing a bong; when I blow through my paycheck just for weed; when I would fuck random guys just to get high.

Yeah, I was a full blown addict. I always will be. I still have my addictions (food, sex), so I still have a lot to work on. It is very frustrating to not be able to enjoy life's pleasures without it becoming an addiction. But it is not consuming me like drugs. I am aware, and I am functioning. This was by far my biggest addiction. 

Life has become so different and wonderful since quitting drugs. I am more social, more focused. I'm going back to school in the fall to study psychology. I am getting a raise and a new job title this summer. I am in love and living with someone who lifts me up. I have more friends. I don't have a temper anymore. I am no longer violent. I love myself. 

I know a lot of you are struggling taking that first step. I know life without weed seems absolutely terrifying; it was for me when I decided to quit. It has become your crutch and your best friend. Weed never judges you or makes you feel bad. It only makes you feel good and safe, like your wrapped in a warm blanket (pardon the cliche). 

But you have to ask yourself: Does the weed own you? Is life simply impossible to live without a pipe/bong/joint in your hand? Because if it is, you need to quit. 

The day I quit, I smoked the last of my weed and threw away all the paraphernalia. I could not have quit if there was any type of temptation in my house. I downloaded the app Habit Hub, which helps you keep track of how many days you've been sober. I did it without a support group, but that was just what worked for me. 

What I'm trying to say is, you can do it! I believe in you. I promise you life will get better. Each day sober has made sobriety so much easier. That first month will suck, but after that, you will feel like a brand new person. Don't let it own you; take control of your own life. You deserve it!

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this if you did. I am so proud of myself, and I find nothing wrong with saying that. 

Be proud of yourself too.

TLDR; I hit one year sober! Fuck yeah!"
"I decided to put the money I would spend on weed in savings. Whenever I have the urge I'm like no this money is going towards saving to buy a new puppy. It's helping me, because I envision holding my new dog and knowing I will need the extra money to take care of him. This really brightens my outlook."
Near Day 24 now 💪😊 
Day 2 - woke up really early with only a few hours of sleep to go hiking up Mt. Chautauqua. Also hitting the gym later instead of my usual smoking. I’m physically exhausting my body out to get through these first few weeks. Hope you guys enjoy the view that I was able to capture this morning ⛰📷 
"Who else here Is quitting for school? I’ve been using the cartridges for a couple of years now pretty much ever since they got to my region, I’ve watched it turn from something fun to do after work to a dependency that’s getting in the way of dealing with my metal health.  

Recently I made the decision to go to college which I am very excited about but I don’t want to be dependent on this shit anymore, I want this to be a new chapter in every way. 

If anyone here is in a similar boat and has advice/experience or really anything to say I’d very much appreciate it."
"9 months sober today! PAWS gets better. Still 1 day at a time, but life is more beautiful each day. Becoming the best version of myself each substance free day. "
"I stopped smoking a weed a year ago and it has been the best decision I've ever made. I was an everyday smoker for 17 years, I had a lot of good times and some bad throughout those years but ultimately I always wanted more from life. Quitting smoking weed allowed me to become the person I had always wanted to become, it took away my social anxiety and allowed me to really open up to others. I hope to continue this path of learning and living and to anyone who struggles with addiction just know there is hope out there. You can do it, become that person you've always to be."
"This subreddit almost makes me tear up I’ve been stuck in a never ending loop of smoking weed and vaping all my paychecks away since high school and it’s just so amazing to have a place full of people that understand the struggle and don’t judge or look down upon you for wanting to slow down or quit and live a fuller life.

I just discovered this subreddit but I already love all of you.

Thank you for focusing on a real issue that’s been swept under the rug by most of the people I know, I’m going to be spending a lot of time on here reading and learning."
"Am I the only one? I have noticed this really peculiar phenomenon while going through my ups and downs of quitting and relapsing. When I am not high, I crave it and feel like it would make everything so much better, so much more exciting and surreal. When I am not high, I usually feel unmotivated without dangling weed in front of my face. That's why I give in almost every time, I convince myself that it's not the ""right time"" to quit smoking (whatever that means). 

Then, when I do end up smoking and riding out my high, I start to feel terrible about myself and come up with all these goals and aspirations in order to change myself. I write it out all down too,  ideas for things to major in, hobbies to pick up, classes to take, health routines. Then, I do none of it, fall asleep and wake up the next day wanting to get high again. 

Does anybody else notice a similar pattern in their own lives? How do you get yourself motivated? Motivated enough to quit? I am stuck, I feel like I have fallen into a very dark place and am not able to grasp onto anything to get me out. Any advice is appreciated."
"I started sober September a day early. 3 days off and I’m dreaming again, vivid dreams. I’m so excited to keep this going. "
"Overcame my nighttime cravings! Battled it out with myself but decided to take melatonin and close my eyes instead. 27F Nights are the worst for me when it comes to smoking! I'm sure a lot of people can relate!! I've cut down my use drastically over the past 2 years, mostly because I wanted to fix my sleep cycle so I could wake up earlier in the morning and be productive instead of having a groggy high-over. Weed hangovers definitely exist!! I was so tired of waking up late, MAYBE working out, going to work for 8+ hours in a hot kitchen, coming home, smoking a few bowls with my roommate, and stoning myself to sleep to rinse and repeat the next day. I stopped smoking in the daytime about a year ago because I couldn't deal with not being able to meet my daily goals. Went from using an 8th to a Q a week in 2018 to less than a gram a week in 2020. Fucking awesome.

Two months ago I started dating my girlfriend who is beautiful, kind, and mature, and doesn't smoke habitually (not that those traits are mutually exclusive but I think it helps to not rely on a substance). Being with her every night has killed the boredom before bed that drove me to want to smoke and just knock out. Definitely not the reason I stopped smoking, but it sure was a big push in the right direction and I'm really grateful for it. I've definitely felt stronger anxiety in the last month, but I enjoy it?? I enjoy the feeling of using different methods to calm myself down instead of numbing myself with marijuana. And I like being present with and for her :)

I took a month off of work after quitting the job I'd had for almost 5 years before moving to a new city and starting another restaurant job. Definitely stressful circumstances, let alone having a kitchen job which can take a major toll on your physical and mental wellbeing. Had my first shift last night, came home super excited but exhausted and did the back and forth with myself for about an hour and a half before deciding to just not smoke, it wasn't worth it, and I want to make my girlfriend proud (and myself, too). I read through a few pages of r/leaves during my craving last night and it was SO helpful and validating. I feel amazing and accomplished today. This post got a lot longer than I intended, but I felt like sharing!! Thank you everyone! xo"
"Made it to one month. I’m not looking for a round of applause. I just want you all to know that things get better.
I smoked weed everyday for 15 years.
After one month of not smoking, I’m actually being able to effectively express my emotions and how I feel. I was going through life completely numb. To everyone trying to quit, hang in there and don’t beat yourself up if you relapse. You will begin to feel your emotions again, so don’t be too hard on yourself.
Stay positive homies! <3"

"Got myself flowers for hitting a month :) That’s all, really. I went to Trader Joe’s and got myself some indulgences, including a little bouquet 💐 :) I almost wanted to cry in the store because I felt so proud of myself and relieved that I made it this far. I made myself a nice dinner and also got a fancy chocolate for later. It’s been a rough week, for reasons completely unrelated to weed, but here I am. I love myself and I’m thankful to myself for getting to this point, and extremely inspired and committed to my sobriety. 

Hang in there everyone. Have a lovely weekend. Love yourselves💖"
"Exactly One Month Sober! Y’all, I can’t express how much my life has changed since I stopped smoking 24/7. One month ago I had a rude awakening when I decided to get high and bail on internship interview. I cried so much that night, realizing I just threw that opportunity in the trash because I wanted (needed?) to smoke. That was it; I smashed my bong, flushed my flower, and browsed this sub for hours. It was time to get my shit together and stop relying on something that was essentially controlling me. The week after was rough, I won’t lie to anyone. Then great things started to happen! My old professor remembered my work ethic and actually reached out to me and asked if I wanted to work with him after I graduate! I’ve gotten the confidence to go out on dates again and meet new people. I didn’t realize how witty I was and I have finally gotten my creative motivation back and I feel SO great mentally. I feel... awake? Alive? I’m facing my problems head on rather than sweeping them under the rug to deal with them “later”. Everyone is so supportive of each other and it really motivated me.
So thanks to everyone for being a part of this huge life-changing event! Good luck to all of you :)"
"Take it from someone who is on day 1 for what feels like the 1000th time, it’s a lot easier to stay sober than to start back and then try to find the strength to quit again. Stay the course if you’re on it. You’ll only regret it if you think you can handle a little and go back to abstaining. Ugh. "
Every second I'm better than the one before 
"Smoking weed makes everything relative to the high When you were younger before you smoked weed and all, you were just living. Sure you had happy moments and sad moments, yet you accepted both as they came and lived without observing your mind much.

Then you smoke weed. People tell you it is supposed to get you high. You paid $20 or so for it and you want to get the most value for it so you really observe your mind to feel the high. 

Then you are sober again and you want to recognize how it is different than being high. So you observe your mind.

The more you smoke, the more you continue to observe your mind which makes you aware of problems through which the weed is meant to fix or cover up. Each time you continue this, you are stepping further away from where you started and where you are supposed to be: living in terms of heres and theres."
Bruh This shit hard 
"Sober for 4 months, bought weed today and flushed it down the toilet an hour later I can't believe I just did that...

I haven't smoked in 4 months after previously smoking every day for the last year \(and multiple times a day in the last 3 months of my use\)

I had been feeling pretty down this week for multiple days in a row, and somehow convinced myself that I could handle smoking again. So I bought a new piece and hit up my old dealer...

When I got the weed, I just looked at it and instantly felt sad. My life has improved dramatically since I stopped smoking\- I never have anxiety anymore, my sleep is great, no more mucus, I'm thinking clearly and doing some of my best work. And I knew that by smoking today, I would be putting all of that at risk.

So, I decided to flush the weed down my toilet and throw away my new pipe. 

All in all it was about $200 wasted. I see it as a low price to pay for the gamble I was about to make...and I think it took actually holding and seeing the weed to fully realize that.

I'm actually feeling pretty proud and happy\- and am gonna treat myself to dinner out tonight with my girlfriend. 

Just felt compelled to share that, keep the good fight going my friends!"
"It's not only about being sober, it's about building a life you don't need an escape from After literally hundreds of failed quit attempts I've noticed a pattern that I wanna share with you all. Usually for me whenever I try to quit i get through the first 4-5 days. I wouldn't say its easy, obviously we all know they suck but it can be done with a little willpower. However, just relying on our willpower to abstain is not a very effective way of going about it since its finite. And over time the thrill of being sober and energetic starts to fade. The low moment start creeping up and you feel closer and closer to the relapse. For me its on that Friday night where I have nothing to do since I've lost contact with all my non-stoner friends. I tell myself that I'll just go to my stoner buddies house and not smoke just hangout, but we all know how this story end... It's sad when you realize has become so fucked up from all the smoking and you still smoke to forget what it has become

I'm curious to hear from you all, where does your deeper need for quitting come from? When these low moments come where do you draw inspiration from? Turning your life around is the lonliest place in the world."
"You're life isn't over because you're an adult and you wasted your youth smoking - it's only beginning. I just want to say for all the people on here who are 30+ or even in their twenties, please don't look at your past with regret and guilt as to what you could of done differently, the only person that matters right now is your present self, and looking at the past with negative emotions only hurts the person who is right here, in this moment. 

You can be fourty years of age and have the whole world ahead of you, meet a new partner, gain a new friend, go to the gym or start other physical activities, everyones lives begin somewhere, there's no specific age you need to be to begin feeling happy. 

But I promise you, looking back with sorrow, guilt and what ifs, doesn't help anyone, it just hurts you. Look towards the future and smile and the good times you had, and forget the rest.

EDIT: I’m happy to hear this helped allot of people, I see many posts on here regarding this so I just wanted to share my mind, have a good day everyone. Excuse the ‘you’re’, late night."
"I used weed to feel better...Here's what I was covering up that was REALLY missing... * Sleep
* Healthy food
* Love
* Water
* Sunshine
* Healthy social interaction
* Movement
* Achievement of goals"
"I did it guys! 3 months and 13 days sober! Never thought I'd make it this far! No more brainfog, no more sweating or anxiety, panic attacks and not a single craving! If I could do it, so can you, believe me!

Thank you to this community who motivated me and was there for me in the beginning of my journey!"
"I went to my first Marijuana Anonymous meeting last night Everyone there was very nice, I was impressed by the diversity in age, gender and racial background. People who had been there before seemed like friends. The leader said “Marijuana Anonymous was the best meeting for me to deal with my addictions because I’m still friends with stoners, now I’m just friends with sober stoners.” I’m three days into this attempt at quitting. I’m trying not to think “what is this going to look like in the long run” or “can I eventually get to the point where I can moderate.” Just taking it one day at a time as they say. I’ll go to another meeting on Sunday. AMA."
"Kinda surreal. The last time I went a whole month without smoking was before I started, back in 2016. "
Getting there! 
"I'm proud of my night! I didn't smoke, pick up any, or answer phone calls for free taste after trick or treating with the kids! I had a glass of wine! No weed this morning & i ignored weed man again!#!😁 im at work, proud of myself, no craving! I know i can do THIS! "
Punched that addiction straight in the face 1 more week and I've hit the 2 month mark :D
"Day 119: It’s all worth it. I haven’t updated or posted in a while. But I’m still sober this time. I said before it’s going to stick and it has. Where do I begin? 

If you’re just starting out, my best advice I’ve ever received and ever given is you need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable for a while. I know you want to crawl out of your skin to escape how you feel in this moment. But don’t, stay uncomfortable. You will adjust, I repeat, you will adjust. 

In the last 4 months, I’ve excelled at work. I’ve passed 2 classes in my college coursework. #3 will be done this month. I’ve faced some social anxiety in the face. It was hard but I made it through and didn’t die or smoke. So it was successful. 

The clear headed feeling is incredible. Once the fog lifts, all is clear again and it feels so good.

But honestly this group is and has been my best asset. I am forever grateful for the over 100,000 people giving support. I would not be here without you. 

♥️♥️♥️"
"First time quitter, 32 days without smoking. The first 2 week were the hardest. Just keep busy. I've been a heavy smoker for over 10 years. If I can do you can too. Good luck."
"Enoughs enough, 2020 rise of the stoner Getting high 4-5 times everyday for the past 3 and a half years. Wasted thousands that could of gone on new clothes, cars or holidays. But ive blew everything in my short life so far on this stupid temporary mental escape. Heard heaps of stories about ex stoners becoming super successful. I will become successful one day. I will eventually get to where I want in life. 
Its time to be hard on all my actions. Actions get results. Action makes change.




Step 1: Forgive myself for my addiction. 
Step 2: Chuck everything weed related out. 
Step 3: Write down openly or privately all the reasons im quitting. 
Step 4: Write down insane goals, break them down into small actions, repeat everyday. 
Step 5: Make a reddit post for motivation/support, reflection. 
Step 6: Never give up ever... theres literally 100 million actions we could try instead of getting high.."
"ENOUGH. Be honest with yourself. I’m getting so fed up with myself. I don’t feel trustworthy.

I’ve been too cowardly so far to commit. “I’ll take a break after this cartridge runs out,” I tell myself. “I’ll stop for just a couple weeks, just to recharge.” Or, the deadliest one: “I have nothing to do tonight anyway, it’s not like I’m missing out on anything.”

These are weak things to say. I know I need to stop, I KNOW it, yet I give myself excuses every time. This means I’m being dishonest to myself at best or abusive to myself at worst.

I need to use firmer language. It’s not “taking a break”, it’s quitting. It’s not “getting back into it”, it’s relapsing. Nights where I choose to get stoned and play the same video games I’ve been playing since 2012 instead of call my family or read a book or get dinner with a friend are **wasted nights**. They’re zero-nights. They seal me off from the world around me and dump my precious, irrecoverable time down the drain.

I feel weak and ashamed when I go to bed high, and I feel strong and proud when I resist the temptation. Is that not enough incentive for me to quit?

Pain is a great thing because it tells us what we need to stop doing. Would I continue to hold my hand against a stovetop after I felt that it was hot? **NO.** So why do I continue to do things that make me feel weak?

I’m done hiding my shame and letting it poison my happiness. I’ll wear my shame like armor, use it like a map, let it point me toward decisions that make me feel strong and proud.

I am addicted to weed, and I am ashamed of it. Enough self-pity. Straighten up."
"day 80 - quitting weed wasn't a magic bullet for my life getting better I'm at day 80 now and I was totally expecting my life to become much better and everything be a lot easier one I quit weed. It took a while for it to sink in that weed wasn't the source of my issues, so quitting wouldn't solve all them. 

&#x200B;

I've had anxiety and depression stemming from chronic trauma for a long time. It wasn't the typical ""beaten, raped, held hostage"" kind of trauma so it went undetected for a long time. 

&#x200B;

I was using weed in order to feel good without dealing with the source of the pain. quitting weed has made me face the pain head on and deal with its consequences, mostly grief but I've also had to work on problematic behaviors that became ingrained through years of the same pleasure seeking/avoiding of pain patterns. 

&#x200B;

So yeah my mental clarity is a bit better. There are not so many ups and downs. My memory is better. But overall everything is just a bit better than before. Quitting weed hasn't been the magic bullet that I thought it would be, it's only been the first step towards living the life I want to. "
"6 months sober and I'm never going back If you want to quit, I can't urge you enough to take the plunge. Its hard and absolutely terrifying, but 100% worth it. 

Every single aspect of my life is better now that I've quit weed (and drinking). My career, my personal life, my physical and mental health, my outlook on life-EVERYTHING. 

I look back on 6 months of progress and its shocking. If you're just now quitting, I want the same for you. One day I want you to be shocked and AMAZED with how far you've come."
"The hardest part of leaving weed behind is that I only want to while I'm high. Wtf. My anxiety gets amped up a thousand times and it feels like I'm losing my mind, but as soon as I come down I forget all the horrible feelings, and I just focus on the little bits that I enjoyed during the trip. And then I do it again, and I suddenly remember all the horrible times. It's weird and bad. "
"Natural hunger 20 days clean now. Had to rush out this morning without eating, 10 min later my stomach is growling and I’m starving.

Used to be midday/1pm before I’d get hungry at all, and even then I’d eat the tiniest amount and feel full. 

Feeels good man"
"Today I am 6 weeks sober after smoking for 30 years :-) it feels wonderful, I'll never ever smoke again! I've done this all myself with no help or support from anyone apart from an app and you guys, thank you :-)

The app I'm using is called 'quit weed' and couldn't have done it without finding this as it tracks money I've saved, joints I've not smoked, along with all the symptoms of what to expect at every stage of the quit process. I'm not there yet, but I'm well on the way to recovery. If I can do it, anyone can do it. Stay strong, I'm proof that you CAN do this. 

Thanks also to everyone who has sent me encouraging messages of support and to all the people who have taken time out to share their journey."
"7 days sober!!! the last time i was sober from weed this long i was in rehab. feeling so proud of myself! made it a week and aside from a lot of crying and a little more anxiety than usual and definitely struggling to eat it’s been amazing!! i haven’t had any big cravings yet, but tomorrow is payday which is definitely a trigger for me. but i’m so grateful to be sober and i am not going to let any cravings that may come up undo all the hard work i’ve done this week. thank you to everyone on this sub!! i couldn’t have done it alone"
"I love marijuana but I know it’s time. Just like playing a certain video game or perhaps just stringing something out longer than it should, I know my time with marijuana must stop. The paranoia, constant criticism of myself, and just the obsessive thoughts of thinking whether I’m a good person or not. I’m not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but it’s my time to say goodbye. The sober me is the real me and is doing a fine good job."
An addict will go trough a lifetime of misery Just to avoid a week of discomfort
"I fell asleep without smoking weed for the first time in almost two years! And I slept great. I struggle with OCD and insomnia, and I’ve been compulsively smoking weed before bed because I’ve been convinced I can’t sleep without it. I have a lot of neuroses surrounding falling asleep, and I’ve gone to great lengths to make sure I can have it when I travel because sleeping away from home in itself is something I avoid. While I’ve been able to halfway quit - I stopped smoking “for fun” a month ago - I’ve been clinging to it as a silver bullet at bedtime. 

I’m excited to make progress without it, and I’m grateful to this community for being a source of support and inspiration ♥️"
"Reasons getting high is not the answer I'm looking for Let's be honest, weed brought me some pleasure, some good stuff - there was not *only* bad - I would lie to myself or be overly harsh on myself if I would deny this. And self compassion is important.

When I find myself romanticizing and being nostalgic for the good parts of what weed can bring me it's important to also remind myself all the negative consequences this has and why weed doesn't work for me, so I'll try to make a list :

\- Whenever I've had a stash at home, I've not been able to moderate and use it reasonably. I have always binged on it excessively.

\- When I have a stash at home, getting high becomes the focal point of my existence. Everything else becomes a chore that I have to get through in order to create the moments where I can get high. Things like friendship, family, my future, become ''stuff to do'', ''stuff to get out of the way'' so I can get high.

\- I isolate and start living a double life which I hide from family and acquaintances.

\- I am not proud of smoking up all the time when I have a stash so this has an effect on my self esteem and self respect.

\- I become paranoid and very vulnerable when high. I cannot deal with the external world when high. A simple telephone call can freak me out. Or simply hearing people talk outside my door, in the corridor.

\- The creative aspect of getting high quite soon leaves place to a more dark and numbing type of high.

\- There are strong chances getting high (especially in unreasonable frequencies) will have a negative impact on my mood even after I stop smoking. Which is a risk that is perhaps not worth it.

\- Positive and healthy habits such as working out, jogging, meditation, journaling, eating well, sleeping good hours become very hard to do.

\- I become numb to what my heart really wants in this life : friendship and love. I delude myself into not caring anymore. But deep down I probably do and one day will regret it. This kind of thinking can occur even while I get high. Which makes me feel guilty and most of all sad.

\- Often, as soon as I get high - I feel regret about being high and tell myself I gotta get out of this. Once I get ''unhigh'' getting high again seems like fun and a good idea. The cycle goes on.

\- If I get high constantly I don' even really remember anymore what happened, what I did. Even if I had a good time watching ''X'' movie, my mind will forget about that.

\- It is not a sustainable strategy, even for dealing with anxiety, because the more I would smoke, the less it will work. After a while I will find myself just as anxious, only that I am also smoking all the time. Which is one more problem. The only way to deal with my anxiety is to practice dealing with it naturally.

There are probably more reasons but this is what I can think of right now.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

Edit : I am very happy and thankful if this list can be of service to anyone :) That's why I thought of writing it on here instead of a simple word doc I would have saved on my computer. So thanks back to anyone who thanked me for writing it :) Also, it feels so damn good to know people can relate and that we are not alone. Often when I go out there in the world I feel so different and isolated from other humans. But in truth we are not ... 

The worst part is that there might be a lot more reasons. I thought of these two later on today :

\- The simple health hazard it poses. Putting smoke in my lungs cannot be good. Why risk my physical health and put my body through this ? Especially if I cannot smoke in a responsible and very occasional way.

\- Pain, anxiety, sadness and life's challenges are, in a way, opportunities to grow. Namely by practicing natural ways to cope (meditation, presence, acceptance, and many more), by finding the strength *inside* ; I've experienced this at times when I dealt with things naturally and as a result I discovered I am not as weak as I thought. On the other hand, when I rely on weed (especially to the unreasonable extent I seem to only be capable of) to deal with pain, I am giving up this opportunity. I am delaying my chance to become a stronger me.

I guess the best reasons are the ones we truly believe.

What are some of your reasons ?"
"Passed my first drug test in 10 years! 30 days clean today. So proud of myself. No more subbing, no more anxiety. Yes boss I'll gladly piss in a cup for you. Such a weight off my shoulders. 
Fuck yeah!"
"Day 447...and life has never been better. I know some of you are really struggling right now. That struggle will last a while. You will feel anxious, you will feel incomplete, sometimes you will feel hopeless.

Don't let your feelings dictate your life. Grab your life by the horns and better yourself every day. Know that by leaving weed behind you ARE bettering your life. Period. Pick up that hobby you left behind, chase that dream in the back of your mind. Be bold, be honest with yourself and others. Learn to love who you are.

The person I am now compared to who I was 447 days ago is a night and day difference. I eat better, I work out regularly, I'm down about 25 pounds. I actually have a short term and long term memory now. I have dreams at night(admittedly this is not always a good thing lol) and I sleep better overall.

I have more energy and I look forward to what life has in store for me. You can say the same things, know that putting down the weed will bring you one step closer. I believe that you can do it."
"A guide on quitting weed and leveling up in life. I’ve been on this forum for almost a month and I think I can contribute to this community. This is my idea of a guide on how to quit weed, I hope it helps at least one person. I don’t want to offend anyone, this is just my thoughts on the matter and I am by no means trying to force my views, I am just sharing my ideas.  Here goes:

Like in everything in life, quitting weed has more than one point of view to it. You cannot just take up one philosophy and say “this is the correct way, all other ways are incorrect.”. Every philosophy has its advantages and disadvantages, so if you focus on just one, you will most likely make the mistake of ignoring the disadvantages and only focusing on the advantages until it’s too late and you find yourself relapsing and being too angry at yourself to want to try again.  There are different aspects through which you should view the idea of quitting weed (or any other addiction for that matter) – Psychological / Philosophical / Physical / Social / Visual. Each of these are connected with each other in a way, they are basically one big whole, but we will just look at this whole from different points of view. I will share my thoughts on each of these aspects in a moment.  These are not the only ones, I cannot think of any others right now, but if I do my job here correctly, you will be able to think of some other factors by yourself.

First of all I would like to accent on the fact that you should eliminate the idea of duality from your everyday life. The idea of duality is that when you think about something, you always create an “internal debate” with yourself about the thing you are thinking about, because you believe that there are at least two ways to view it. For example when you think about quitting weed, one part of you thinks “weed is bad, I must not use it again”, and immediately another part of you thinks “well it’s not all that bad, I mean there has to be at least 1% that is positive about weed because I’ve smoked so much, obviously there HAS to be something good about it”. This creates an internal struggle to pick one side and stick to it, because you want to think everything through and make sure that you have the right thinking about the subject matter and that you aren’t making a mistake about this. Now imagine how such and internal debate emerges every time you focus on some thought, it feels very overburdening, doesn’t it?  In order to remove the concept of duality you must acknowledge and accept the idea that everything is one. Smoking weed is just smoking weed, there is no need to label it as bad or good, it is one whole thing. If you focus on one part of it and label it as good or bad, then you create duality and hinder your progress. The things I write may be hard to understand intellectually and logically, but through practice, you will start to gain understanding of what I am sharing with you. This is something I picked up from Zen philosophy, if you would like to know more about this, I suggest you read the book “Zen mind. Beginners mind” by Shunryu Suzuki.

Psychological Aspect:
	When you want to quit weed, you have to make sure that you understand the idea of wanting to quit. If you really want to quit then you make that decision and live with it day by day. If you understand this then you will not be afraid of relapsing, because you do not want to smoke again even if you have the option to do so. When you say to yourself “ I do not want to smoke anymore” you are stating that it’s just something you do not want to do and that’s that. Even if somebody says “ Dude , let’s get high, come on bro, I got a big bud here etc.” it doesn’t matter because you have consciously made the decision that you do not want to smoke. Similarly if you have some internal “popup” to smoke it doesn’t matter because ultimately you do not want to smoke anymore. Do you understand what I’m saying here – You do not want to smoke anymore, why should you smoke again because of some small internal though that made you think about smoking, not about YOU WANTING TO SMOKE, just about smoking (there is a difference between the two things) ?  What does it matter that you think about smoking, when you do not want to smoke. Some people fail here because when they admit to themselves that they do not want to smoke, they are not fully devoted to that idea, they have not looked into every part of themselves and have not unified the idea of not wanting to smoke, it is exactly because of that that they easily relapse when someone offers them a joint. These people say “I will not smoke anymore, (except if a person offers me a bud/ if I find weed on the street/ if I get really stressed etc.) “. This is again the concept of duality – if you both want to stop smoking, and you do not want to stop smoking, how are you going to succeed at either one of these things?

 Philosophical Aspect:
	You have to realize that when you stop doing something that you have done for a long time, your life will change in more ways than one. When you stop smoking you might notice	that you no longer watch TV every night at 10PM or that you think about life differently now, that is perfectly normal, it is in change that we find enlightenment. Understand that life changes every single day and that you are paying more attention to it now, because up until recently your senses were numbed and you didn’t care about life in this way, you didn’t care about change enough to notice it. Accept everything that happens in your life, do not try to rationalize and understand every single detail of it, to accept it for how it is, is to understand it fully. You can always make your life better if you put your mind to it, there is no need to relapse just to cope with change.  With time and practice this philosophy gets easier.

Physical Aspect:
	When you stop taking a substance that you’ve been using for a while, your body is going to react in the beginning. This is called withdrawal and is also something that is going to pass. You might experience sweating, diarrhea, anger etc.  Know that this is a change your body is making and you have to bear through it. Every minute you “suffer” is bringing you closer to that wonderful moment when you no longer feel pain because you changed something in your life – in this case stopped smoking. There are ways to reduce the pressure of this transition – physical activity / green tea / cranberry juice / meditation and so on. Try some of them, if they don’t help, they won’t hinder your progress.

Social Aspect:
	When you decide you don’t want to smoke anymore, a change you are definitely going to notice is that the way you communicate with other people is going to change. You may think to yourself “I cannot have fun with this person now that I’m not smoking “or “I can’t get myself to be nice to someone because that person annoys me too much now that I don’t smoke”. The change in communication can also be something like “Hey this person is pleasant company now that I’m not high so much of the time”. It is important to understand that people are different, some will criticize something you do, others will support it, and others will be indifferent. Whether someone talks kindly or harshly about some idea you have or something you do, you do not have to react. You must accept the fact people are different and that that is just how they function. It is not necessary for their words to affect you if you yourself do not want to be affected.

Visual Aspect:
	A good way to help support your change in lifestyle is to make a change in your appearance. That way, when you look at yourself in the mirror, apart from the fact that you’ve decided to not smoke, you see a different, changed person. I’m talking about a new hairstyle / dressing style / less fat/ bigger muscles etc., something that changes the way you look so that it is easier for you to accept that you’ve changed and that you are constantly changing. 

So far I can think of this much and I hope this information helps you understand yourself and your life a bit more so that ultimately you can level up in life! If you found this guide helpful in any way, give it and “up” vote and post a comment so that more people can see it :) .

"I'd rather stand in 0°C than sit in a toasty hotbox car I'm on Day 8, and saw my brother for the first time in a month. I casually mentioned I've stopped smoking and he was like ok cool, but soon enough he started rolling up in the car.
I didn't stop him, or get tempted to join him, but told myself if he doesn't respect my wish to quit I have to show him how serious I am.
As he went to light the spliff, I stepped out the car and told him I'll make some calls while he smokes.

It felt like forever, and it was cold as fuck but I was super proud of myself. I've tried to quit many times before but 'just one puff' reels me back into the habit.

I want to hit 30 days cleans. Then 90. Then 180. Then 360. 

I'm so done with this poor man's drug"
"Today is day 1 after 22 years of continuous use Quitting has been on my mind for several years, each time I try I lapse within 48 hours. I was never properly motivated, but now money is tight, I'm getting older and my health is ever more important.

However, my main motivation now is the Laws on Cannabis and driving have changed(well in 2016, but hardly enforced until now). For now, if you have a level of THC in your system its an automatic 1 year ban from driving. The levels are ridiculous. I've heard of people being busted for Drug Driving upto 7 days after they have smoked. For us regular users, I'm perpetually over the limit.

Ridiculous that they give the same punishment for driving drunk vs driving a few days after a smoke!

Regardless, its another reason pushing me to quit. So day 1 is here, I've a busy long weekend planned to keep my mind off things.

This sub has been inspirational and helped motivate me into quitting once and for all, so thanks for that.

Watch this space.

Edit: I have a friend coming over tonight to take my stash and all other paraphernalia!

Edit2: So many kind words of encouragement, thanks guys. nice to know I'm not alone in this."
"300 After 15 years of heavy daily bong smoking, one brain tumor surgery, and multiple CHS trips to the hospital, I finally made it to 300 days sober today."
"Not much to brag about but I’m 24 hours down! Last night was my first work night voluntary (aka not on a vacay or staying with family or something or just out of weed) without a bowl in like 5+ years? I got home and didn’t really know what to do with myself, so I went grocery shopping and made dinner. Which I usually don’t do (usually just binge trash food). I didn’t sleep well, which I was expecting...but I feel good this morning. Hopeful and a little proud. Anxious about going home tonight and doing it all over again. Glad to feel like I have the right to post here. A long time lurker, and I would often unfollow when the posts hit too close to home (often)...but I’m really grateful this space and the people in it exist!

EDIT: wow, I was nervous to post and thought I’d maybe get a few encouraging remarks, but was NOT expecting this. Thank you all. I’m right in the thick of night two and it’s hard and honestly I wish I was packing a bowl, but I’m not bc I know that desire will lessen if I don’t feed it. I’m sending all of you good vibes as you go along your journeys as well. Love hearing about them."
"One year without Cannabis. Today is my one years old birthday. It's been one hell of a journey. I didn't think it was possible. After using for 20 years I felt like I was in a prison. I used to tell my friends to sneak a joint in my coffin, so I could spend eternity with my true love. I've done a complete 180, and learned so much about myself throughout this process. I will never chastise weed as I believe it has many benefits, and millions of people have the ability to enjoy it without having a problem. I know now that I am not one of those people. Instead of consuming Cannabis responsibly it consumes me. I still get cravings with ideas of how nice a smoke would be, and I don't think that will ever change. I'd like to thank this community for the inspiration provided during this time. I'm grateful for the support team I've surrounded myself with that allows me to express my concerns in times of need. None of this would be possible without my best friend who I consider a brother that I met on r/leaves. We live on completely different sides of America and have forged a life long bond. Most of all I'd like to thank me for putting in the hard ass work required to make this happen. I want to close this by letting anyone struggling know that you can put an out of control problem behind you. It sucks hard. It takes time and work. There are plenty of shitty days before the really good ones start. It's a physical and mental battle. It takes everything you have at first, but before you know it you'll turn that corner and begin enjoying life without a safety blanket. I wish all of my former stoner brethren continued success in your future endeavors, and those of you who are considering joining us, I extend the invitation to join the club. Go out and make today the best day possible, and then make tomorrow even better. Once again I'd like to thank everyone that is a part of this community, and I look forward to the continued inspiration I know you'll provide me. Year two here I come!"
"Turn down some joints last night and feel so proud today. Was at a wedding yesterday, had a few drinks and it was a great day and night! Anyways long story short someone who works with mr lurkey gave him 2 pre rolls and I managed to stay strong and refuse them. 

I did battle back and forth and toy with the idea about 4am when I couldn't sleep, but thought about how disappointed I'd be today if I broke my streak. 

Instead today I'm super proud... so so tired and currently crawled back into bed but so proud of my willpower!!!"
Can I get hell yeah? 
"Without weed I can talk again. Growing up I was always very social and articulate. It wasnt till I started smoking that I became withdrawn from others. It's like the classic stoner voice (""heeeyyyy mannnn"") didn't fit with how I normally spoke and, because of this, I found that I would often slur my words/misspeak in day to day conversation. I became very self conscious of this fact and opted, in many instances, to just remain silent instead of engaging with others. To make matters worse I used weed as a way of dealing with my newfound antisocial behavior. 
Since having quit, I've regained my ability to speak quickly and precisely and I've never been happier. Being able to communicate with the outside world the way I want to is better than any high I've ever had. "
"Day 365- One technique that worked for me. I made a promise to myself before I began sobriety. 

It was that I was allowed to smoke weed. However, if I were to go and smoke pot, I had to write one hundred sentences: ""I am not a pot smoker anymore and today I will be sober"".

That's all. I ended up writing the sentences like 10-15 times. Each time, by the end, I was kind of hypnotized and never acted on my cravings.

I think it's important to have a system like this or a plan because if you smoked heavily for long periods of time, you will have cravings that are uncontrollable and need to know how to deal with them."
"A day in the life of active addiction (featuring booze) vs a day in the life of sobriety... And general ramblings and reflections on 18 months sober. A day in my life of active addiction: Wake up, go back to sleep two or three times (not that I’ve completely stopped doing that...), wake up around 6 pm, usually extremely hungover, try and fix my hangover with greasy food, bong rips or more sleep. If was working, rush to get ready, pack and smoke a bowl or three before working, binge eat and watch TV before my shift. If I was out of pot or wine, obviously I had to go get some more, so I’d be late for work. Work, waiting for it to be over the entire time so I can go smoke and drink myself into a coma. Wake up, repeat, with odd trips to the grocery store where I had to get stoned before, feeling so anxious and stupid, reeking of weed, eyes glazed over, fucking everything up, constantly losing my keys, phone, purse. Very rarely hanging out with people but when I did, shitty people I didn’t even like who didnt have good intentions with me, but I kept them around because they could get me drugs, dab carts, etc. What else are friends for? Occasionally going out with my real friend, and making a jackass of myself every time, begging her to buy me wine as she’s 21 and I’m not, showing up drunk and high, trying to drag her into my addiction. Being late for everything because I have to get drunk and high. Oh that concert I really wanted to go to? Miss half of it because I had to smoke before, or was snorting shit in the bathroom. Remember none of it because I got wasted. Maybe leaving my house once or twice a week. Hobbies include crying over my life’s trauma, giving myself 24 hour hangovers, mindlessly scrolling through social media for 10 hours a day while binge watching Netflix shows I’ve already seen 10 times. Never brushing my teeth properly let alone flossing, exercising (unless “hiking” aka going into the woods to smoke pot counts as exercise!). 

A day in the life of recovery: Wake up, try not to fall back asleep again... Dunno if I’ll ever kick that habit! Make a cup of hot lemon water with turmeric and cayenne pepper, light some incense, feed the cats, do a 10-20 minute mediation. Stretch and do yoga for around 30 minutes, listen to positive affirmations. Make a smoothie (I’ve recently gotten into green juice, who am I!?) and have a bagel with hummus. Usually I shower, go run errands, I like to go to thrift stores, museums, the library, find new parks, hike, bike, take walks with my mom, take my parents dogs to the park, hang out with my family. Pre covid, I was traveling for really the first time. I went to multiple concerts every week, music is my life and going to shows brought me so much joy, as did traveling, so not being able to do either has really been a challenging adjustment. But I’m really trying to continue creating a life I don’t need to escape from, even in the age of covid and everything else going on in the world. After I’m done with my errands and sober adventures, I get ready for work, I’m lucky enough to work from home these days. Time goes by faster at work when you’re not stoned btw. After work, I eat dinner and watch a movie (still trying to kick the binge eating and binge watching, but I do watch new stuff! Discovered I’m a big Star Wars and Marvel fan, and also have watched a lot of the classics! Still have some catching up to do). I try and read, meditate, and journal before bed, drink some tea,listen to an audiobook, and play with my cats, but I’m not perfect. Sometimes I play anagrams on my phone or scroll on reddit till the sun comes up. Sometimes I binge watch a show till the sun comes up. And sleep entirely too late the next day. But I ALWAYS brush and floss! At least twice a day. 


I’ll be 18 months sober on the 17th. When I was using, I was very hedonistic and had this idea in my head that being drunk and high makes everything better. It makes the boring grocery store better, it makes movies better, it makes life more vibrant and cool. Maybe thats true the first few times you drink and smoke as a teenager, you see the world from a different perspective. But after the 10,000th time.... You’re just numbing yourself and softening and blurring the world. It doesn’t improve anything, it takes away the details and intensity. And maybe it numbs the pain and suffering by default, but it’s not fucking worth it. Abusing drugs and alcohol to treat your deep seated trauma and fucked up life is like slapping bandaid after bandaid and some lidocaine on a deep festering oozing wound. Yeah you don’t have to directly look at it anymore, but you’re not treating it, you’re just numbing it and hiding it. Sobriety can be really fucking hard, especially at the beginning. But it’s no where near as hard as continuing to live as an addict and being a shell of yourself and living a half life that revolves around substances that make you act obnoxious or brain dead or both.  


My life has improved 100000x over since becoming sober. My life was drinking a bottle or two of wine and smoking 10+ bowls everyday. Now my life is just life. 

I went to see my sister and baby nephew recently, and listened to my brother in law talk about his various home improvement projects and the work he’s done on the house. 2 years ago, I would have showed up high to my baby nephew’s 1st birthday and thought the entire time “This is so boring, I wish I could go smoke. This is lame, I want a drink, why is he so excited over power washing a deck when he could be smoking/drinking? I want to get high” Now, I thought it was so sweet, and thought about what a good dad he was, especially when he said that he wanted to make the bar a concession area and the basement a movie theater because he doesn’t want an entire part of the house to be alcohol centered for his son and his friends. Sure, power washing a deck might be boring to me, but holy fuck it’s definitely more exciting and productive than drinking poison and killing my brain cells 24/7. This is a giant rambling mess but I really just wanted to share it with someone.  

Life is so so so much better on the other side. You deserve recovery and sobriety and to be happy and healthy. To everyone in early sobriety, you’re fucking amazing for having the courage to try sobriety during this clusterfuck of a year and to continue to stick with it. I am so fucking proud of you, I know early sobriety is so painful sometimes but you will make it through this!"
"The ”illusion” of creativity Just wanted to share some thoughs of mine. I understand that maybe everyone can’t relate.

I read a quote a long time ago that kinda stuck in my head. 

It goes something like this:

”With one hand, weed gives you interesting thoughs and creativity. With the other hand, it removes the ability to benefit of those things”.

Been thinking about it every now and then, and to me it completely makes sense.

I’ve gotten so many crazy thoughs and ideas through my years of smoking, but those thoughs barely evolved to anything else than just thoughs.

There are countless times where I have felt that it was gonna be much easier getting tasks done during the day if I was just a little bit high.

Mostly, I ended up not really doing those things. It made me lazy, unwilling to do things to my full potential.

Always felt somewhere that weed would help me in the process of drawing or playing/recording music. 

I think there is a honeymoon-phase in the beginning of the relationship with MJ, where these things are possible, and it makes you somehow productive.

But from what I have realized (a long time ago, before even wanting to quit), it actually works the opposite way. It distracts your mind to focus on the important things. I have just been standing still while life goes on without me.

I’m not saying this applies for everyone, but I am sure many can relate"
"Wooh :) went on a walk every time I wanted to smoke, just finished a run and it was the most comfortable one yet. On Day 6! I'd been counting my days wrong lol but I'm looking forward to one week tomorrow. I've been listening to this Dissect podcast dissecting Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly whenever I go on walks and it's such an interesting analysis. Best advice I can give to those in that one week window is to face your cravings head on, figure out WHY you would've turned to weed in the moments where you caught yourself wanting to smoke.

Y'all got this, I got this too 💙"
"Weed have fucked my life up. Started as a flirt and slowly became the answer to everything. Every problem, every pain, every mental issue i fought with. It became my identity. 

First time i smoked i was 14. Was love at first toke. Some bad shit happened and just like that i was 21. Voices started to manifest in my head.  I then closed myself in a room and detoxed. Was a scary thing to hear a voice in my head that was not mine that commanded me to do things.

Started getting my shit together and got in education. Took a job and that caused a work related accident that squashed my spine.

Few years after i toked once to sleep and just like that i was addicted again.  

I realized i have socially isolated myself.  Been on a reality escape and nobody cared so i just kept on falling down.

I am 40 now. Have sat in constant pain and smoked weed. Day and night for 10+ years now. Blamed this and that. The sexual abuse from my sister and my mother. Found so many reasons and excuses. But none of them was good. 

This is no way of life.

Went on a date a few days ago for the first time in years and it went well. But my memory is fuzzy about it. Think my memory have taken damage.

I toked last night and that deep paranoia was back. I got to stop this shit. It's no joke anymore.

Weed in moderation is great. Weed 24/7 really fucked me up. Never thought that the chase for relief ended up causing more damage than the accident.

Going to cut down.

I cant take this way of numbness no longer.. 

The paranoia have not left me yet.  Have not waked and baked for the first time in years.  

We have one life and i wasted it being wasted.

Going to get clean now.  Time to get in touch with myself again.

Peace. 

R."
"Almost 1 year and my depression and anxiety have TRANSFORMED it’s not like these don’t exist in my life anymore, but they’re so much smaller and more manageable than when I was using weed. 

Weed made me shriveled, small, incapable. I feel myself in more control of my life. Life hasn’t changed, the world hasn’t changed... I have changed."
"I HAVE A WEEK OF SOBRIETY TODAY!!!!! Sorry I just had to tell someone!!! I'm so proud of myself! 

I've not gone more than a day without smoking since I was 16 and now I have A WEEK. 

I feel things again. Its scary I'm not gonna lie, but WORTH IT. as many difficult things in life are :) 

I know weed is not a problem for most people but my life has revolved around it in some form for four years. I'm 20 now and for the first time since I was 16, I'm able to TRULY care for others and myself most importantly. 

Guhhhh. I'm just so happy :)"
Haven’t smoked in a month and I’ve lost 13lbs! I was a human vacuum when the munchies hit. Had a health scare recently and decided to better myself especially with my family history of heart problems. Completely changed my habits and diet and I haven’t felt this good since high school 😁
Hit 2 weeks today! No weed and no cigarettes. BIG THANKS TO THIS SUB! 
"To those of you trying to make your last toke a perfect memory, you can't. Romanticizing your last use only leads to picking back up. It is too easy to delay your life with this destructive thinking. Like many of you I have had around a hundred ""last times."" This plant never gave a shit about my life or my aspirations. Yet, I clung tight to my addiction always with a great and plausible excuse to chase the high one more time. The world is passing by and we are trying to say goodbye to a plant. What advice would y'all give to those on the fence about their last dance with mj? What works and what doesn't? "
"103 days Hey guys. i was a daily, chronic smoker from the age of 17-28, the only breaks i had was when i was on vacation, or when i couldnt get my hands on any weed. The latter did not happen often, lol. I tried to stop a couple times, but didnt last more than a month.  


For many years i wanted to stop, but as most of you know, it takes more than just talking about wanting to quit. Talking is easy, talk is cheap. Action is what defines us, i know its a cliche, but still.  
I knew for a long time that i eventually would stop. In my mind i knew it was a wrong path, when youre smoking every day. So may things youre missing out on. The decline of health, economy and many other aspects.  
Some people dont see the problem, they re fine by smoking everyday. They dont see it as a problem, or rather refuse to. Those people, im afraid, are them that will smoke for the rest of their lives. But not me, and not us in this community. Were alle here cause we know theres more to existence than the getting high. We are on this sub because we are able to reflect about ourselves, and this journey we call life. You got to consider that as a strength.  


So here i am. Its my birthday today. Im turning 29. I havent smoked weed for over 3 months, and its my first birthday in many many years, where im not gonna celebrate it by rolling a spliff.  
Its a strange feeling, but also a very pleasureable one.  
Those 3 months hasnt been easy. At the 2 month mark i woke one day with alot anxiety, that lasted for a week. I didn't feel well, and still dont know what it was about. I guess it was my mind and body trying to adapt to my new life, and trying to send me signals that would make me smoke again. But i didnt do it, i think i would've gotten even more severe anxiety by smoking. After all, anxiety when i was high was one of the reason i decided to quit. The high just wasnt the same, as in the beginning.  


Im a little proud of myself, take care all!"
"1 month of no smoking, and never looking back again. Wow what a different feeling this is... 
7 years smoking full time.. age 22. 

Once before i have gone one month weed free.. but this time is different. This time i’m much more clear on where i want to be in my future. 
It was a toxic relationship and it was not going to get me anywhere that i needed to be. A lot of times i would break down and cry whilst trying to quit for 8 weeks continuously, (yes, 8 weeks it took me, maybe even longer, to actually quit the habit) and ask “why me” “why do i have to be the one to do this when all my mates can continue” and i figured out the answer to those questions and i feel it is truly to become a beacon of light for my mates that want to quit but ‘cant’, and also to prove to myself something that i never thought was possible, and being able to start chase my dreams in full motion. 

I remember, whilst trying to quit in those 8 weeks, i threw my bong out in the bin 2 times, and went and retrieved it from a dirty bin both times, and even threw my weed in the fire at home, and the next day went and bought more. (Was a q) Instead of giving up i couldn’t accept that was my fate... you have to keep pushing and not give in. 

Since i have stopped smoking.. 
-Hardly any cravings anymore (i think this is due to enforcing that i’m not a stoner anymore, and moving onto a new personality and life) 
-Started reading again at least 30 mins per day 
-Meditate atleast once a day sometimes twice
-Have become more focussed in my business 
-Anxiety and depressive thoughts are slowly subduing  
-Eating vegetables nearly every night 
-No more eating junkfood everyday 
-Walk my dog everyday now and started to workout 3 times per week
-Still get major brain fog when doing sales calls or talking about in-depth topics trying to find ‘that word’ 
-My happiness and gratefulness to be alive has greatly improved. 
-Enjoying more of the simple things like different blue sky textures and the birds playing in the trees instead of being wacked on my couch. 
-Deeper connections with friends and family. 
I wont go any deeper on the list 😅

I think what helped with my mindset is instead of continuing to ask myself why me, i chose to see it as I’ve been chosen for a special task. Ive been given an opportunity to better my life dramatically, and i need to do this otherwise i will forever be the same.. 

If your considering make the change, dont kick yourself if it dosnt work out right away. Just keep pushing. I believe in everyone in this group and this group has helped so much with constant notifications to keep my mindset clear. 

My tips: 
1) Make your goals and visions 100% clear, enforce that being a stoner is not apart of your new life 
2) Do your hobbies in the first 2 weeks to distract you from smoking. 
3) Smash your bongs or pipes or put them in the bin THE NIGHT BEFORE BIN DAY!!! 
4) Read atomic habits by James Clear (audio book available) 
5) Make sure your friends know that you aren’t a stoner anymore, and take some time away from them if you need to. No harm in helping yourself! 

Much love... sorry for the long post. 
Truly hope this helps some people, at least 1 person and thats my goal for this post accomplished.. My next post will be at the 6 month mark.. keep kicking brothers and sisters ❤️❤️"
"Does anyone else just replace THC with alcohol when trying to quit? I have been a every day smoker for the past 12 years. There was about a 6 month period about 5 years ago that I was 100% sober but I went back to the daily THC use. The last couple years every time I do try and quit I just end up drinking instead to replace it. I had to not smoke for about 2 months for a job and during that two months I got drunk every single night instead where normally I would get drunk maybe once a month. I also drink large amounts every night when I do this (like 12+ beers or almost a fifth of liquor).

Edit: I don’t know what I’m looking for with this post. I know I have a substance abuse problem and I need real help but I guess I just wanted to see if anyone is in the same boat. I feel like this whole scenario makes it even harder to quit. I start feeling terrible from drinking so much every day and It really starts taking a toll on my health quickly so I switch back to weed because at least it’s not as bad for me as my drinking. 

My journey last time was really hard and no where near how I wanted it but at least I quit for 6 months. Now even 6 months seems like an absolutely impossible task with a 1,000 more roadblocks in the way.

Edit2: Thank you to every single person that had responded! I have read every single response multiple times already and am taking them all to heart. I really truly do appreciate the kind words and encouragement more than any of you will ever know."

I'm so glad I'm quitting and I won't have to deal with any of this crap anymore.
Thanks for being here leaves!

edited to fix formatting. Can you tell I'm new?
"
Want to thank this sub for helping me quit. This sub was an integral part of getting me sober. I just wanted to really thank the people in this community. I havnt smoked in 5 years. Even tho I miss it all the time it was better for me in the long run. Thanks again guys and good luck
"Over fifty years old, over one hundred days sober. Yes, proud I feel I ‘ve made it so far. 

Was worth the cravings, the anxiety, depression  of the first weeks. The ups and downs, that still go on, diminishing.

I got me back a healthy body, a clear mind, a feeling of control.  I can now even try to help others.

Just starting to see behind the curtain, though.  
And there, lie more beasts, calm and waiting.

I really don’t know if I want to fight them too, or let them be, as if they were not mine.

Hope to get even stronger, even calmer, day by day. I can just stay aware and wait.

I am just over fifty, just over 100 days clean.
Older and younger than most of you, if that matters."
"[Day 9]Who am I? I cannot put into words how different my life feels after a little time away from marijuana. I had no expectations on this journey, the only thing I knew is that it had to be done. And now,  I don't even recognize my face in the mirror. 

Every morning, I notice something new about myself. My eyes don't look empty, they look bright, energetic, full of life. My skin is sooo much clearer, my voice less raspy. My hair is darker and shinier, much healthier than before. 

Who am I?

&#x200B;

Let me tell you who I am, I am u/Stay_Wavey and **I am becoming the hero of my life again.**

I feel like I own who I am, and what has helped the most give me this feeling of empowerment are the new habits I started since I stopped smoking pot. These are some of my new habits I have replaced my addiction with. I hope I can inspire one another person, the posts on here have kept me going through the hard times. It was an uphill battle with insomnia, cravings, and overall apathy, but you must embrace the process to overcome the storm. **The rainbow at the end is Goddamn beautiful.**

* I am getting up everyday at 4:45 AM and can (finally) fall asleep early (between 9 :30 and 10 pm).
* I am  spending most of my time in my studies aggressively pursuing my dreams. I want to, and one day will, become a machine learning engineer.
* I am in the gym most days. My body is getting stronger and I feel more confident in myself
* I meditate twice a day, the anxiety about my life is gone. 
   * I practice positive affirmations and remind myself all of the great things that make me me and how truly blessed I am to be where I am today. You cannot be stressed and worried when you are always grateful for the situation you are in
* My friends, some of whom I haven't spoken to in years, really missed me. I am making a commitment to call one friend I haven't spoken to in a while to say hello and catch up.
* I have a self-care routine for my skin, hair, and teeth. I am feeling better and better about myself. 
* I started Bullet Journaling and it has been an absolute game changer. Nothing feels unachievable, this is the most empowering feeling of my journey
* I spend more and more time by myself in nature and have started getting into photography. Nothing major... yet
* I blog and write about my journey into the tech industry
* I am building a website that can educate children on how simple and fun coding can be
* This isn't a habit, but that smoker's cough is gone. 

To overcome our addiction, we MUST invest more and more effort and energy into living a life that we no longer want  to escape from. It's not easy, and some days it is extremely exhausting. but it is so much more rewarding than smoking 

&#x200B;

Cheers mates, Blessings to you all on your journies

"I did it!! Thanks, leavers, for your help along the way! "
"Day 1 - it’s all gone Just threw everything I owned out. Bongs, papers, even some weed lying around in a jar that I had actually forgotten about. It was soo hard to do and I contemplated one last hit but I didn’t. I threw that weed out. Day one here we go! 

We can do this!"
"Feel like a different person, I woke up this morning for the first time in 2 years and my first thought wasn’t about weed. I’m so happy. Love you all, your posts have given me power and strength. We can all get there if we want it bad enough. "
"The secret of change is to focus all your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new - Socrates I’ve had about 30 motivational quotes as a desktop background for a few weeks now, but seeing this today was like seeing it for the first time. So much of addiction recovery puts all the focus on fighting the addiction. We focus on not using, not relapsing - the underlying message is that we're taking something away. But as proven time and time again, what you focus on is what grows. Focus on quitting (= not having something, lacking, depriving yourself) and it’s a struggle. Instead, focus on building the life you want for yourself. It's so much easier to put your focus on the things you *can* be doing instead of the things you're not allowing yourself to do.

Today is my day off and instead of spending the day stoned (or not stoned, wishing I could be stoned), I have been eating healthfully, I exercised for the first time in weeks, cleaned up my room, and sat outside in the sunshine and read for a while. What are you doing to create a better version of yourself today?"
If you stop smoking today you will reach 100 Days by New Years ! (repurposed from r/stopdrinking and u/wallssofjericho :) )
"To all the people quitting during the holidays... To all the people quitting during the holidays,

Just a quick note.  I find it nearly impossible to quit at anytime, nevermind the holidays.  The strength you guys and gals are showing by choosing this time of year to quit is nothing short of inspirational.  Hang onto that.  Know you are strong.  You got this!  

Merry Christmas everyone!"
"Day 93 - reasons why I am so grateful on this day to have stopped 93 days ago. Worth every tear thru all the agony of sobriety. I speak at a meeting today in front of representatives, advocates, the family, the medical team and the CEO of my company on behalf of my client & the continuation of his services.

Because I’m 93 days removed from weed I can:

-turn the nerves from dread to excitement
-meditate on this being an opportunity rather than a chore 
-hold onto my thoughts rather than “blank” mid sentence 
-hold eye contact rather strongly rather than quickly look down....my eyes are open now, they’re open and clear and alive and bright rather than tired, red, baggy, dead
-speak with confidence and a steady voice rather than drift off and collect myself with “um” 
-hold my hands in front of me rather than fidget 
-handle the possibility of potentially messing up rather than drowning in defeat & catastrophic thoughts of failure 

Holy shit I just.....have been riddled with these issues for the past 4 years and it has impacted my professionalism in a way I didn’t even realize until I stopped.

It hasn’t be easy to stop and stay sober this long, it’s a battle but my life is exceptionally more fulfilled sober.

Best of luck."
This is the first 4/20 I’ve been off the weed since high school. 136 days and going strong. You all can keep clean too!
"My dad ripped bongs daily until he died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hi all,
Throwaway because throwaway.

Since he was 16 my dad smoked weed. He was about 37 when I was born. The man I knew as my father was a shell of a person. He was an artist, and quite talented. He was kind and sometimes funny. But mostly he just sat on the couch watching shitty TV ripping bongs all day. His house was disgusting. He grew his own weed which enticed many of his gross ""friends"" to come over all the time. One of them broke into his house and robbed his corpse before calling 000 (911). 

He died when I was 20. I'm 25 now.
When he was alive he grossed me out so much that I ""knew"" I would never smoke weed. Alas, when my friend said she had some, I tried it in grief and with naive bravado in an effort to ""understand"" why my dad chose this substance over his kids. I wanted to ""prove"" that I could start and quit something that he never could.


Well, as you can imagine, that first experience felt pretty damn great. I tried it again once with fake weed and the high was so incredible, I was dancing with colours and music felt alive. 
This got me into DMT briefly, and magic mushrooms. 

But mostly, I smoked weed. Not every day. Rarely ripping bongs. But enough to be using it as an escape. Enough for it to seriously impact my mood, increasing my anxiety and allowing me to be satisfied with mediocrity, to ignore the fear and dread that has been welling up inside me since that first time with my friend.

I flushed it all down the toilet yesterday. I'm done. I will not let this tricky, conniving little plant own my life like it did my Dad's. 

I'm not saying it's the Devil's lettuce, or bad for everyone, but you need to recognise if you have a problem and get it out of your life once you do. 

Too easily I began accepting subpar standards of living and isolation.

No more.

"If I had smoked last night... Hey leaves,

Last night, I got home a little drunk. I'm 4 days in to quitting. It was so nice out, the sun was setting, and I was craving **hard**. I was picturing the usual dusk smoke sesh on my porch. I was fighting not to text my dealer to come by with 3.5. If I had given in and smoked last night, here's what would have happened: 

* I would have waited an hour for my dealer to come by, missing the sunset altogether and been annoyed as shit by the mosquitoes while rolling/smoking
* I would have settled in to the couch and watched the same dumb tv show for the hundredth time while feeling super anxious, until I got too exhausted and went to sleep around 1am.
* I would have woken up at 11 feeling like shit, stayed in bed on my computer until 1pm, rolled up and smoked again
* I would have neglected to do anything that I need to do on my days off and become more anxious
* I would have ordered shitty, unhealthy food for brunchdinner
* I would have ignored my brother and sister asking if we could get together for dinner tonight
* I would have smoked again and repeated all the above

**Instead**, I finally pushed through. I usually don't make it past that kind of craving. Here's what happened instead:

* I enjoyed my waning tipsiness with delicious reheated pizza and a beautiful sunset on my porch. Pizza over dope any day. The cravings were gone by the time the mosquitoes came out.
* I watched a couple of episodes of a new, engaging show
* I ran a bath for the first time in forever and read my book
* Was in bed and asleep by 10:30pm, I woke up naturally at 7:30 feeling good and well-rested
* I went to the grocery store early and bought healthy, well thought-out food
* I cleaned out my fridge of old crap and ran my laundry through
* I walked in to town, went to the bank to deposit and got what I needed to do for work done
* I felt good, so I extended my walk back through the woods and enjoyed some nature **sober**
* Organized dinner with my siblings knowing that I'd follow through
* My best friend got some bad news. Instead of ignoring any texts I got, I was able to respond and support him, and make plans for tomorrow to see each other

Leaves, I had an enjoyable, productive day off. It was great. It was great because I told the little green monkey to fuck off last night."
"2 Years Since My Last Smoke! The past year was such a whirlwind - marked by the painful loss of my incredible father, a move to another continent (to be with my family),  and a full career change. I was actually shocked to realize it's been 2 whole ass years since the last time I rolled one. I don't know if sharing this will help anyone and I'm sorry it's long! but I hope so, because I know how hard it is to get beyond that ""one more day"".

I'm turning 31 next month. I spent most of my 20s stoned out of my mind. I was an externally ""functional"" and stealth stoner - no one (even my closest friends) realized that I was high literally all the time, including at work - or they just assumed it was nothing serious. As someone with years of practice hiding my mental health issues as well, I was caught in a trap of disassociation, numbed out suicidal depression, executive dysfunction and suppressed anxiety - but all behind a guise of someone who had it together with a big smile. I tried quitting so many times - never lasted a day (""one more won't hurt...""). Eventually, things fell apart, piece by piece, but I kept smoking. It took a huge paranoid meltdown at a Kendrick Lamar concert (yeah.. :(...ruined that birthday gift from my partner) to realize that something had to change.

I did the opposite of ""one more smoke"" - I did ""one more day without smoking..let's just see if i can do that, then I can smoke"". I signed up for therapy (which used up the money i would have used for weed). I told my friends so they could hold me accountable (I staged my own intervention, basically), and I would stay with them when I was struggling. My partner, who wasn't hooked but smoked with me, stopped in support. I threw myself into an obsessive art project that took up all my mental energy. I don't know why it worked, but it did. Once my dad got sick though, there was no choice - I could not be stoned if I was going to show up for my family. It didn't help that I felt guilty as fuck for being so absent over the years. Let me tell you - if there's one reason to quit, it's so you can show up for your loved ones before it's too late.

Listen - quitting was hell. The revelation and the sunshine, honey, did not come right away. I got up close and personal with my darkest demons, and started to realize how many mistakes and fucked up choices I had done in my haze over the years. I slowly realized (and am still realizing) just how bad my mental health issues are. I realized how many friends I lost because I was too stoned to show up or reply. I'm not blaming the weed, because 100% I made my choices, and my depression and anxiety played a huge part - but the weed blurs everything. I used it as a constant escape, an act of fear every single time.

It's been fucking hard guys. But so, so, so worth it. I'm finally facing up to the years of unaccountability. I'm finally showing up for my family. I'm finally showing up for MYSELF, and taking steps to deal with my mental health. I actually am experiencing life again. I have a great job with an amazing company, that I'm trying really hard not to fuck up with my depression. But despite this being one of the hardest years of my life, for the first time in a while, I am proud of myself. 2 years baby. Fuck yes!

Please know it is possible and worth it. And no, it's not easy, but you'd be surprised at what the human spirit can withstand. Even if you fail, that is not a determinant of destiny - it just means you tried, which is fucking badass. (I still need to tell myself this - it's a process!)"
"What weed does to me I was about to head to the dispensary but I opened reddit and read a post on leaves, and I was able to stop myself. Here's my list:

1. Makes me very emotionally unstable on the comedown. A passive aggressive comment from a roommate will have me bawling.
2. Makes me feel guilty since I've been telling people I'm trying to quit and then doing it behind their backs.
3. Makes me less articulate. I even had to google for the word 'articulate'
4. Makes me sleep poorly.
5. Makes me impulsive.
6. Damages my lungs.
7. Inhibits my ability to study. I'm trying to study algorithms for job interviews and it really requires strong short term memory
8. Makes me feel like an addict. I go through periods where I can't stop thinking about how to get high.
9. Makes me compensate for depression and not get at the root issues.
10. Makes me feel like a hypocrite for judging my stoner roommate and then sneaking it in myself.

Thanks to everyone else for sharing and motivating me to share my thoughts!"
I used to look down on this subreddit I gotta be honest in case anyone else is lurking and in my position.. I thought the posters here looked silly.. I couldn’t believe people thought weed was soooooo bad.. I was just totally in denial about my use. This community is one of the most helpful things now. I’ve only smoked around 5 times in the last 14 days and I’m very optimistic about the future. Y’all really are great and I hate that I used to think that.
"1 year free from Cannabinoids! Thank you Leaves community!! I’m a couple days late from the actual one year mark but I’ve really been looking forward to the day that I get to this milestone. As a former grower in a medical cannabis dispensary and a hash maker/processor/personal grower in my own personal time; I never thought I would live to see this day.  From a half oz of flower (or more) plus several grams of concentrates and lots of mg of edibles ingested daily I thought I was stuck in a loop, a cycle I could never break, but I know I’m not the only one because this sub reddit showed me that regardless of what your situation and background are it’s possible to be in control of who you want to be. Every day that I felt like smoking and everytime my friends were smoking around me I would scroll through the words of inspiration and wisdom from all of you guys. Whether it was someone that was going through their first day or someone reaching their first year it all reminded me of why I wanted to stop in the first place and where I wanted to be in my future. Without cannabis I wouldn’t be who I am today and I’m somewhat thankful for what it provided me when I truly needed it but a fine line was crossed and I never stepped back from that line and I felt the need to quit. Dependency is a risk that all of us have taken by habitually ingesting cannabis, but breaking the dependency is something that is more than achieve-able. Thank you r/leaves for being there for me when nobody in my life understood. From the early anxiety, sweating, irritability, having dreams for the first time in 9 years, nightmares, and panic attacks to the urges to relapse and start all over or even just having someone to talk to and let them know that it really does get better. Even though it wasn’t easy, I wouldn’t have been able to get through this as easily without you guys
Thank you r/leaves
I’m forever grateful 
-Jared



TLDR I made it one year, this community helps each other no matter what stage of the journey you’re on, leaves kicks ass"
"I've noticed that when I'm smoking, I'm more resentful I don't mean 'when I'm smoking' as when I'm high, just periods of time when I'm smoking nightly.

Being sober for a bit now I find myself able to interact positively with different people at work, school, and especially in my family that before I would find so anxiety inducing or hard to be around. 

I was often resentful of them, such that I would be easily irritated by things they say or do. It's such a good feeling the way it is now. It's not that I suddenly love everything about them, but simply that I recognize that I'm happier just accepting them for who they are instead of avoiding them or wishing they would change. Especially regarding family, acceptance is REALLY important.

If you are like me and have had a traumatic childhood, such that your family is a reminder of it, I believe that smoking that trauma away is what causes me to be resentful. 

Thought maybe some people might relate to this."
"Celebrating one year free today! Never thought I’d make it - you can, too! "
"I went on a date last night. one of the reasons I quit smoking was the effect it had on my relationships. I become a stereotypical lazy and apathetic stoner when I smoke, and it turns out that girls aren't really into people who don't give a fuck about anything. 


I went on a first date for the first time since quitting a month ago and it was amazing. I was present for the entire conversation, I was witty, I could show my sense of humor and carry on whatever we were talking about. We talked at a bar for 3 hours and by the time I got home she already sent a text asking when we were going out again. 


If I was stoned this simply would not have happened. I know this because I've gone on plenty of dates stoned or as a heavy user. I know the nervousness it would make me feel, wondering what the hell should I say, what will she think, ect.


Everything has gotten better in my life when I choose to do things with a present mind. Thanks for all the help and anecdotes others have shared here!"
"Does anyone ever confuse chronic cannabis use with a mental disorder(such as depression) before they quit? I am not trying to deny myself the possibility that I might suffer from depression aside from my marijuana use, but I am wondering if anyone here has ever, while being a chronic user, believed that they suffered from depression or anxiety until they quit weed? 

Like I'm wondering anyone has ever thought they had depressions but it was really just the effect of cannabis on their brain?"
made it through week 1 
"A moment of realization as I date a stoner I quit a few months ago (past the 90 days mark), and I've decided to re-enter the dating field. I've been dating this one stoner girl for two weeks now, and while it doesn't tempt me to smoke when I'm around her, man have I realized exactly what I was when I was high every day. We've hung out three times and she was sober each time--great conversation, etc and honestly it just feels natural. Yesterday was our 4th time meeting up and she had just smoked, she is a _zombie_ after smoking both physically and mentally. Her face had this expression that the ""lights were off"" upstairs, and her conversation skills slowed down to the point where she couldn't contribute in a meaningful way to the conversation. A lot of head nodding and 'yeah', 'ok', 'got it', etc. Mainly the look on her face was the most disturbing, here am physically talking to someone but upstairs, mentally...no one's home.

I saw herself in me before I quit. This is who I was, a zombie. And just like her, when not high we're two very interesting people able to hold conversations and truly experience life when we're social. It made me incredibly sad after I left yesterday thinking (1) I would've never had this realization if I was still smoking and neither will she and (2) how much of my life I wasted 10+ years being a zombie. It's frustrating knowing I will never get that time back.

I'm certain I'll have to break it off with her, it hurts to grow close to someone and at the same time watch them devolve. I'm also not into chastizing others into quitting or changing their life for the better, I'm a firm believer that you have to come into that realization on your own. It just sucks because I keep thinking about 'what if' and the lost potential :("
"Biggest benefit so far... I am 3 weeks sober and the best thing about it (after the first two weeks of not feeling great) is that I no longer ""protect"" my nights and weekends so I can get high AF and play word games alone on my phone. I've been out with friends every night this week and made plans for this weekend. I also feel much sharper at work and that feels amazing.  I feel more confident and I'm loving life again. For anyone going through the first hard weeks, hang in there, it will get better!! ♥️"
"A note on withdrawal symptoms (TLDR: 4 weeks and you are physically back to normal) I don't know if I should post this or if it is to trivial, but here it goes.

I struggled with withdrawal syndroms for about two weeks after quitting. Anxiety, depression, extreme irritability (I would strain not to lash out at my girlfriend sometimes), thankfully not alot of sleep issues, but still quite bad. Especially the depression part made me want to start smoking again, to ""make it all stop"".

What helped me was a paper I found when I googled for ""Cannabis Withdrawal Syndroms"" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414724/). It states that the cannabinoid receptors that are activated by THC and other cannabinoids in weed will desensitize during periods of regular use (they talk about more than 3 times a week for a period of 6 months or more) and this causes any physical and some psychological withdrawal symptoms.

When you stop smoking, they will start to normalize again and this process takes about 4 weeks, with symptoms declining (on average) after 2 weeks. So anytime I found myself lying in bed and feeling like absolute dogshit, I would tell myself ""give it at least four weeks and if you don't feel better then, fuck everything and smoke again"".

Now here I am at day 17 and I feel great. My mind is much clearer, depression has mostly lifted again and the irritability is gone completely. So I'm glad I stuck with it and maybe some of you can take some solace when it gets hard during the first days or weeks. It will definitely get better and there's even scientific evidence for it!

EDIT: This gained more attention than I expected, so I just wanted to add something: Don't feel like something is wrong with you if depression, anxiety or anything else that you experience after quitting lasts more than four weeks. This was only about physical differences in the body, psychologically there is alot more going on and everyone is different! Quitting is the first step to self improvement and the things that it numbed might come back full force. But now you are able to take control over these things instead of repressing them, so be brave and stay strong!"
"A clear, coherent mind is truly worth fighting for. 
That’s what I keep telling myself so I don’t cave. I’m in the middle of day 2 without weed and its hard. Only managed to get three hours of sleep at night, and I can’t sleep right now because of my ADHD meds. Just want it to wear off in hopes that the crash is enough to knock me the fuck out..."
"Does anyone else tell themselves that they're going to have one last hoorah and get super high and that's going to be it? And then the next day you tell yourself the same thing.... And the next... And the next... I always tell myself okay this is going to be your last time. You're going to get super high, smoke all your stuff and you're going to be done with it. Plan on watching cool TV shows or new movie etc. etc. (I always go back to the same shows) But the next day I'll go buy more stuff and it's always the same thing it's always tomorrow."
"When I'm high, I tell myself ""I can live without this"" When i'm sober, I crave marijuana like crazy. Does this resonate with anyone else?

I'm 22, The first time I smoked was 17 but not regularly until I was about 19 or 20.

Maybe it's just that the craving is sufficed when I'm high, I don't know. What I do know is that it's making stopping pretty difficult. I'm easing away gradually, cold turkey is not an option for me.

When I'm sober; I am extremely anxious, self-loathing, irritated, and very unproductive. I feel like i'm in a constant state of panic basically. Smoking usually eliminates some of the said feelings, which always lead to me ending up caving in.

Some of the feelings when I'm high are, lost or disoriented. When I'm high I can say no to another joint or that extra toke, I can consciously say to myself ""This is enough I am done with this shit."" That's a broken record to me though, I can't even think of all the times I told myself I would stop. 

If anyone else has had these kind of feelings, what did you do to overcome them? "
"Taper taper taper taper & also, you should taper Hey guys. I’ve been in this thread for a couple years just passively reading stuff. Now I’ve quit myself and have some advice for y’all, albeit kind of obvious. 

I’ll preface this by saying I’ve smoked everyday for the last seven years. The last time I didn’t smoke for more than 24 hours was when my baseball team made it to the state tournament my junior year of high school. I just graduated from college last month. There were points during my time in college where I would go through a gram of concentrates every day. 

Now, here I am 48 hours into quitting, and I hardly notice that I’ve stopped. All it takes is slowly tapering to keep at least the physical symptoms of withdrawal at bay. When I decided to quit, I was going through an eighth each day with an industrially large bong. The first week, I cut down to just a few bowls a day. The next week, one bowl during the day and one to go to bed. The following week, half a bowl during the day and finish the bowl for bed. Then I spent a week taking 1-2 hits per day when I really felt the need. Two days ago was the last time I smoked, and I slept like a baby each night since and have actually had a more normal appetite compared to while I was still smoking. 

If you are wondering why I quit, there are many reasons: it’s expensive; I need to find a big boy job; I admitted to myself that I’m simply not as sharp as I used to be; smoking started to exacerbate my anxiety rather than provide relief from it; my stamina in various sports is trash lately; and I wanted to be able to travel without worrying about the cannabis laws in a particular place. 

I know tapering off marijuana may be easier said than done, but if you’re serious about quitting not becoming a nightmare, it’s something to look into. It takes less effort to taper, in my opinion, than it does to lay in bed all night awake with cold sweats and an empty stomach. 

Y’all got this.

Edit: I think the main reason tapering worked for me is that I suddenly started having anxious reactions to smoking, and I slowly stopped seeing it as my safe haven. I totally see how tapering wouldn’t work for others, and I apologize if it sounds like I’m just telling everybody to do something impossible."

"Celebrating one year today. This is the last time. On this day last year, I (30F) quit marijuana for the final time.

11 years ago my brother passed away suddenly. I was 19 years old at the time, having just started my sophomore year of college. I quickly went from being the bubbly cheerleader type to being a complete stoner as I self medicated. I had no idea how to deal with grief and trauma. None of my friends had gone through anything like this, so I felt extremely alone. It didn’t help that my school had a huge weed culture, and I almost failed out of school several times. 

When I quit for the first time back then, I had to deal with all the suppressed emotions which came flooding back.  I got professional help from a therapist, who helped me to accept my grief and guilt. I graduated with a horrible GPA but made it through nonetheless.

After about four years of being cannabis-free I thought it would be okay to smoke socially. At first it seemed to totally fine and it felt under control. When it became legal in my state, things got worse and I got hooked on weed candies during a bout of depression. I was still functioning well so I continued to justify it, but my anxiety and depression eventually got out of control as a result. 

Today it’s been a year since I’ve used marijuana and I did it with he help of a therapist again. I am happier and more creative. I just want to acknowledge that this is a lifelong affliction, and that you’re never safe just because you’ve stopped smoking for an extended amount of time. I wouldn’t have been able to quit again if it hadn’t been for this sub! Thank you! 

TLDR: Started chronically smoking during a period of grief and successfully quit. Thought it would be okay to start smoking socially again but it slowly spiraled out of control. Hoping to warn others."
1 year guys! 
8 days clean! 
"A comprehensive history of how pot helped to f*ck my late teens/early twenties (and how I want to make it different from now on) EDIT: Thank you all so much for the replies. I really didn't expect this reception. This sub is absolutely great, and I wish all of us much strength to get rid of the mental haze. 

My first experiences with weed were great. It was a novelty, made me feel different, expanded my thoughts - I've always been inclined to philosophy and things like that. Made me feel my mind was booming. This kind of feeling persists sometimes when I smoke today. But I believe this is all a big illusion. You don't need pot to be creative, to have the ideas you have. You just have to sit with it and dedicate yourself, when you're writing for instance.

When I got into university I was very young at 17 years old. That was the second half of 2013. I smoked pot kinda often, but it really wasn't such a big deal on my life. But when word came to the uni veterans that I was a 'pothead', it instantly became an association people made with me. I remember my early semesters, I would be 100% sober at campus and people would ask me if I was high, and making jokes (not like bullying... friendly jokes) about me being high and looking high (I'm a quiet albeit sociable nerdy-hippie-dreamy type). It got to the point that it started to bother me. Can't people just look at me and see beyond that silly pothead persona that was imposed upon me? I'm much more than that, y'know.

Let me continue - I started to hang out with the potheads at uni. I'll be honest - I made good friends at the pot circles, in the hidden places at the campus. I really liked these inicial times. But the best part of it only lasted a semester or two. I was young, didn't care about much, it was a discovery time, 'let's see how it feels to watch that movie/play that game/ listen to that album while high' etc etc. Over some time I developed a daily habit of pot.

In the first semester of 2014 I got a really interesting opportunity for an internship in some hipster enterprise that was starting, regarding music and branding (I've always loved music, playing music etc). They didn't have an office so I was supposed to work from home. It was really hypey and I had been chosen among many candidates, even people older and more experienced than me.

After I got the job and my first assignments, can you guess what happened? That's right, I would just stay high at home, play videogames and whenever I was supposed to do my job I would just lay down in bed and feel like shit. I was young, I was silly, my dad is an asshole that besides having abandoned me and my mother at a really young age, beat me up really bad when I was 14, mom's got no idea of discipline even for herself, and my grandpa (who was always a father to me) had recently passed away, so I had no one to help me, to say that I was supposed to work instead of playing, smoking and being a little shit all day. No one to say that I should have grabbed that opportunity and kept going. I basically just had a shitty performance at the first month and I left the job. The hipster-entrepeneur guy who was the boss was really sarcastic with me, and to this day I feel angry and sad everytime I hear about their agency or think about that time. Angry at him for being an asshole, but mostly at me for being such an irresponsible kid. 

After that, things didn't really get any better. After grandpa died (which was a bit before all this job thing) - exactly the day after he died, I started a relationship with a girl my friend had introduced me to in a house party. It was like fate, just after losing someone so special to me, she came into my life. To this day she's really important to me even though we're not together anymore. I'll call her G.

G was a great girlfriend, really understanding and caring. But there was a problem - she was a really heavy drinker and cigarette smoker. As an anxious and sad young man I eventually became just like the fiend she was. We'd go to clubs every weekend, many times we'd do it in the middle of the week, get fucked up on alcohol and pot. Soon she also introduced me to cocaine. I spent most of the time with G, in her house, smoking a lot, drinking, ordering chinese food, watching things and making love. Then we'd find a party to go, and meet her best friend who was the worst cocaine fiend of us 3, and one of the saddest creatures I've ever got to know. Then the three of us would get really high and drunk and etc. 4 to 5 times a week. We were doing coke once every two weeks, sometimes every week.

Me and G, we were both lost souls, unsatisfied with our subjects at university. She was a cinema student, I was in advertising and absolutely hated it. But I didn't really care I hated it. When I wasn't blinded in love with G in her house, I'd be at my family's home, smoking pot and playing Counter-strike with my buddies talking on Skype. Uni was easy enough - I've always been a reader, and theory and research were always natural to me, so I excelled in difficult subjects, while on the practical side of things I was gradually being left behind. You see, all my colleagues in advertising were starting to choose their paths. Some went to marketing, some to video, some went to graphic design. I just lurked around, smoked joints and cigs and met with my friends. Absolutely disconnected from the actual reason to be there. I hated all that fakeness and superficiality that governs the world of advertising, plastic people, plastic lives... But I felt like I didn't have anywhere to go. I didn't WANT nothing. Didn't want to BE anything. My depression was hitting really hard at that time. I had absolutely no idea of a future. Around this time I had a course on music production, which showed me a new path. But I had absolutely no discipline to compose at home or actually study the subject like it deserves to.

That was basically how my life functioned from 2014 to around the first half of 2017. I eventually broke up with G. I left cocaine, but I was still drinking and smoking both pot and cigarettes. I still felt the same way. At lost, with no perspective of a future or a career. It was the beginning of a really depressing phase of my life. Where I tried to get shit back together but just couldn't. I felt so lonely I ended up in a relationship with a girl who had many personal problems, but she wasn't understanding  like G. We'd be locked up entire weekends inside a tiny apartment, having really loud and absolutely pointless arguments. She even spat on my face. But I couldn't let go of her. My self esteem and mental sanity where absolutely rock bottom. I soon lost some friends because she didn't like them. I spent a year dating this girl and working part-time in a shitty public sector thing where I'd just play Age of Empires 2 all morning. At least it was inside the arts campus and I liked to hang out there. Again, my company was the pot and the booze and the cigs.

After breaking up with this girl in the end of 2017, I started cycling a lot. It helped fight the anxiety and trauma. Sometimes I'd cycle really fast and yell swear words. Then I started to go to the bohemian district of town every night. I decided to not try to muffle my problems with relationships and 'love'. I got out of the last one too traumatized. I had my bike and my independence, after all. 2018 and 2019 I spent going to cheap pubs, made a lot of ""friends"" on the street, became kinda known in the street which is really funny. But yeah, all of it cycled around getting high and drunk. I fell into cocaine again, then back out. Got a job with brand design in a renewable energy place. Absolutely hated those burgeois shits. Got kicked out because I just didn't fit. Then I started doing freelance graphic design for some friend's clients. The income is pretty low and I constantly feel I'm being exploited. I'm paying the price of ignoring myself. I'm stuck to this fucking advertising industry. 

Around the second half of 2019 I started to change my mind. I decided to quit drinking when I went out at night. And it started to work. Going out became a thing about cycling and meeting my friends, and not getting drunk. At the end of the year I vowed to live for myself and not ignore myself anymore. Then covid-19 came. As horrible a situation as it is, it's been an opportunity for me. I'm proud to say I've been 20 days without nicotine and never want to go back to it, haven't got drunk in months and I am now dedicating myself fully to music and music production. I'm back in meditation as well, doing it almost everyday and having insights about myself. 

But I still. Smoke. Weed. That goddamn weed. I know I have to stop. Weed's been there sabotaging me and helping me sabotage myself for 7 years now. I want to remember what life is like without it. I need to... That's why I decided yesterday was to be the last day I smoked weed. 4/20/20. I'll be strong. And I'll change my life. Thank you for reading."
"Week 12, on vacation and a buddy had a Jay, normally I would be looking to sneak off and enjoy a puff. I can honestly say I did not feel the need to do so. With time it does get better, I have no cravings anymore. This year is going to be great! "
"Remind yourself, it is actually a WONDERFUL thing to stop smoking weed I wrote this as a comment on someone else's post but I felt like it warranted its own post.

&#x200B;

 

Keep on setting the intention in yourself to quit and continually remind yourself that its actually a wonderful thing to stop. You might feel mad because you feel like you're missing out, or in some way you're still attached to weed. Find out where that attachment lies, and what it is. For me I was attached to the feelings i would get from listening to music while high and that kept on sucking me back in. In the past I would be upset because i felt like i was missing out on the great feelings.. But reframe your perspective and it will be easier.

The fact is you're here because some part of you feels like your life would be better without it. For me I had to seriously remind myself of all of the great opportunities and doorways that would open for me with sobriety. I thought of all of the things Ive been missing out on from being high all the time. When you flip it on its head like that (rather than feeling like youre missing out on getting high) and seriously find a reason to rejoice in sobriety, you are dissolving the attachment to weed.

For me now when theres an urge or a thought comes up like ""oh i could get high right now"" i force myself to think ""no, weed does nothing for me anymore. i have used every ounce of benefit from weed, it has served its purpose. I no longer have anything to gain from weed, but i have EVERYTHING to gain from sobriety.I will gain clearer thought processes, easier time socializing, easier time planning and following through with what i TRULY want in my life, i will gain self-respect and a sense of accomplishment for finally doing what i know i must do.""

And by the time i remind myself of the fact that this is LITERALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS I CAN BE DOING FOR ME, the urge is gone. Because i evoke the legitimate emotion of rejoicing. And, friend, Im sure you have used up weeds benefit long ago. You're here after all.

This process of rejoicing is much easier than gritting your teeth and forcing yourself to stop when in the back of your mind you think you're still missing out on something. Write yourself a list of all the things you gain from getting high and be honest. Really see if theres something you think you still gain from it. Then write a list of all the things you will gain from sobriety.

I am only 9 days in this time around, but it has been the most easy and even enjoyable process for me because I have solidified it in myself to look forward to a wonderful, beautiful future for myself. For the record, it took many many many attempts to quit for me. Which is why I say continue to set the intention to quit and even if you slip, set the intention again. It will click for you, I promise.

And as a side note, since my attachment to music while high was a big one for me, I was pleasantly surprised to see my emotional response to music skyrocketed, rather than being half-there stoned out of my mind trying to recreate the same feelings of when I first listened to music while stoned. If the attachment to some pleasure of media (ie: tv, video games, music) is still there consider the fact that, assuming youve been getting high for years, it will actually be more pleasurable when you're sober. Because thats the great news, it will be. You will be refreshed and satisfied to see you will enjoy everything you enjoyed while high to an even higher degree. Because you will be truly present with the media you like.

Best of luck, much love, and dont beat yourself up for failing. You WILL get this. You WILL get the life you deserve, free of the insidious plant that has held you down for so long."
"Day 19 - Working out is a cheat code for changing your mood. I was depressed af and giving into negative thoughts. Worked out with a buddy for 1.5 hours and I'm chilling right now Working out is a cheat code. Trust me, fucking do it. Stop complaining, stop making excusing for yourself, just fucking do it. Life isn't easy. Just go to the gym or get a workout in. Keep pushing yourself. Working out is a cheat code to release endorphins in your brain. Today fucking sucks and the last 5 days have been shit, but everytime after working out, my mood is lifted and I feel 'normal'. 

Just. Fucking. Do. It."
"Wake up, smoke weed again. Hey, I'm new to r/Leaves.

I'm a 25 yr old cone-head from NZ. Been smoking spliffs every day since I was 16.

I've been thinking about my weed addiction for the last few years and finally mustered the courage to write about it. I thought it could be cool to share it here and see who share's my experience.

It's in a kind of corny poem/song format but the rhythm of it helped me get it out, as opposed to writing it out like a diary entry or something.

Cheers!

I wake up, smoke weed again.  
Say hello to my old friend.  
Same thing I do every day.  
Yet those feelings don't go away.

  
Medicate what I don't understand.  
So I don't have to comprehend.  
What it takes for me to be a man.  
I say I can't but I know I can.

  
Don't know why I approach life this way.  
Change now and my problems go away.  
But something's holding me in place.  
I think it's the weed that I embrace.
  

I sit back, smoke weed again.  
I'm getting tired of this old friend.  
Always makes me waste the day.  
As long as we're together it's ok.

  
Always with me, it's comforting.  
Always stopping me from confronting  
My emotions so I chase the bliss.  
This is a feeling that I want to miss.

  
I look back at myself judgingly.  
Asking why I don't stop, half-jokingly.  
I know each day I smoke it holds me back.  
But I'm not racing, why chase a stack.

  
I lie down, smoke weed again.  
I'm pissed off at my old friend.  
Makes me awkward around my family.  
Forget talking to someone new to me.

  
I'd rather hang by myself, there's nothing cooler.  
I tell myself that, but who'm I trying to fool here.  
I stare at the computer, it's glare calming me.  
I don't feel alone, 'cause I've been smokin' trees.


If I get my shit together, I can free myself.  
But I'm scared of asking my people for help.  
If I do it on my own that could be respectable.  
But that will take some work, I'm a dope smoke receptacle.
  

I close my eyes and smoke weed again.  
I can't even look at my old friend.  
I blame him but I should be blaming me.  
For the shit I let it do to me.

  
All my fault but I can't live with that.  
So I light another spliff and play diplomat.  
Just smoke until the end of this last bag.  
By the time I get there, I forget the nag.

  
I'm off to score again, I know it looks bad.  
God, I hope I don't see my dad.  
If he knew, I don't know what that would do to me.  
But that's the same selfish thinking that's killing me.
  

I wake up, smoke weed again.  
Say hello to my old friend.  
Same thing I do every day.  
Yet those feelings don't go away."
"Weed makes me feel okay about doing nothing with my life. I’m sick of being complacent. I’ve wasted the past 4 years of my life chasing the feeling of being high and it’s costed me so much. The longest I’ve been without marijuana in the past 4 years is 3 weeks... I’ve forgotten what it’s like to have a mind that isn’t clouded. I applaud those who are able to balance their lives with marijuana, but I’ve come to the realization that I’m not one of those people. Weed makes me dumb and forgetful. It makes me more inclined to indulge in porn and food. It makes me waste endless amounts of time doing nothing. It causes me to have problems with my girlfriend and it causes me to have problems with my parents. It’s held me back so much. I don’t want to be held back anymore, I’m so sick of living in this cycle. I’m so sick of saying I’m going to quit and not actually quitting. I’m so sick of being controlled by a plant. I don’t need marijuana to be happy and I don’t need marijuana to get through my day. "
Had an argument with my mom and smashed my bong. I'm Done. Im new to this sub reddit so don't mind me. I started smoking in grade 11 in high school. It was a fun pastime for me and my friends until everyone graduated and started doing their own things. I still smoked regularly almost everyday after grad for a year and a half. It went from being fun to being a hassle. My parents aren't fond of it and it brings up arguments. My girlfriend is also really against it which is another reason I wanna quit. I really love her and don't wanna lose my love and my family over this stupid vice. I'm beginning today after I had a spat with my mom which left her in tears and I felt responsible for that. So I took it into my own hands and shattered my bong. I was thinking of going to pick some up this morning but after the argument I wanna get my shit together. These last days I've been easily pretty angry and frustrated at having my family around me. Ik its a really fucked up feeling and I want it to stop. I want my family back. I wanna be me again. Thank you for reading all of this. Some support will go a long way. Stay strong 💪
"7+ Days Sober and holy shit I missed being present. Being emotionally available for people who need me at any time. Not having to ignore a call because I'm too fried. Human connection. Also. I was an avid muncher...Lost 7 pounds since last week due to consistency in the gym, healthy eating, and I literally have barely felt like snacking. Cooking for myself is a fun process, not a drag. I feel high on life just by looking around at our beautiful earth and being present minded enough to realize how lucky we are to be able to experience life and how much I was keeping myself in the dark. I feel like myself again and I never want to be out of control of my actions(too high to do fucking anything). Even when I started a week ago, I did not consider this ""recovery"" because that would mean I was an ""addict"" and who would want to be classified as that? 7 days later, and I seriously feel like baking myself a fucking ""7 days sober"" cake because I am not worried about when the next time I am going to smoke is. It took me a few days without it to realize how much this drug controlled me and my whole day/life. 

&#x200B;

I am trying to spread so much positivity into the world and with how productive I have been in just one week, it really makes me sad that I wasted these last few years stoned instead of building myself up and living at my fullest potential. Ohh the things I could have done! Ohh the things I know I am still capable of, though! I feel so on top of the world right now and I just wanted to share it with you all. Life is seriously amazing, guys. Let's stop trying to escape it! 

(My mom passed away less than a year ago and she was the most important person in my life. I know things come up in life and you think smoking might temporarily help, but it will be much worse to face your true heart down the road, instead of taking care of them now. It feels so much better to feel pain, than to not feel anything at all. Life is seriously what you make it.. My mom would be so proud of me right now.)"
"Still going strong, it really does get easier just keep doing what you are doing👌👌 "
"Over 1 year sober, here's what I learned. Not using a throwaway, fuck it. 

I'm 19 but started smoking when I was 13. Smoked daily multiple times a day from 14-18 and have now been sober from weed and darts since Feb 2017. Quitting smoking alone isn't going to transform your life but it might transform your outlook on it. 

When I was a daily smoker I was doing so partly because it felt like being high was my normal state, but also to help with my depression and anxiety. I'd wake up, rip a bowl. Spare period in school, run outside rip a bowl (I'd bring a bong to school alot). Lunch, rip a bowl. After school, bowls. The worst part is that a lot of my friends were the same as me and our sessions weren't even fun anymore. Initially we all had so much fun and would laugh until we cried and then went out to get snacks but it just wasnt like that anymore. We just did it to feel normal again. I can't speak for my friends but it felt like I was a walking zombie, always tired with no motivation to do anything without caffeine. 

A ton of people recommend smoking to cope with depression which I can understand if you're using it as social lubricant in the right settings, but after smoking weed for so long my relationship with weed and the way I felt while high was super unhealthy. I had this thing where I felt like I needed to smoke before anything (food, sex, movie, etc) so I can maximize pleasure and I became obsessed with ""not wasting"" any moments. Smoking weed in busy social settings started to make me stay in my head and make me paranoid, whereas it used to make me sociable and fun to be around. I knew I wouldn't have a good time going out if I smoked, and I knew I couldn't resist smoking so I just stopped going out with friends. Soon after my depression, eating disorder and anxiety escalated to a point where I was unable to leave the house. I dropped out of school. Girlfriend and I broke up. Stopped seeing my friends. Kept smoking weed. I gave up on my life. 

Two suicide attempts later I decided to change. I can't remember what sparked me wanting to change, but I know it came in the middle of the night and that I grabbed that little spark of motivation and held onto it for dear life. I threw out the rest of my stash (an h/o mind you) and decided to just try being sober for a while. I had no idea this sub existed, and no one I knew would ever stop smoking so I did it alone. I took baby steps to fixing my life. I said first weed goes, and the next week I stopped smoking cigarettes. The first 2 weeks were crazy difficult. Every time a pang of depression hit I wanted to run to my bong and hit a batch bowl, but I couldn't. I had no weed. So I kept myself busy. I started taking the gym seriously. Started drawing again (something I never thought I could do sober). Tried to slowly fix my eating habits and bargaining with myself to try and be healthy. Started reading books I'd put off and watched some anime on my to-watch-list. It was hard but I knew that if I could make it the first two weeks, I could give it up. Sure enough 2 weeks went by and I've made it this far, 1 year and 1 month later. I'm currently finishing high school online and have been seeing girls again. Your situations might be similar or drastically different than mine, but I feel these takeaways (as a product of my last year or so) can help anyone struggling to quit.

Takeaways: 1) Keep yourself busy, especially the first 2 weeks. It doesnt matter what youre doing as long as your able to throw yourself into it and keep your mind occupied. Throw yourself into school, into work, into that hobby you neglected. Read a good book, spend time with your pets. When bad cravings hit, you'd much rather be busy than sitting on the couch flipping through netflix. If you also smoke tobacco, they have a bad rep but fidget spinners helped me immensely. Cravings may be especially bad in the evening after work/school/etc so I highly recommend going for a walk, or eating outside/grocery shopping at night just to get you out of that headspace.

2) When bad cravings hit and you're not busy, turn to physical excercise and cold water. This helps for quitting tobacco too. Not everyone can just drop everything and go to the gym for an hour but if youre physically able, do some pushups. Get a pull up-bar. Do crunches and leg lifts (abs recover fast so you can go hard every day). After youre done, splash some cold water on your face. These two when done together wont magically cure your cravings, but it'll get your blood pumping and help you remember why you want to quit in the first place. 

3) Mental clarity/brain fog/dreams. For the longest time while smoking, I couldn't remember my dreams. I've come to learn that cannabis suppresses REM-sleep, which is when you dream. REM sleep is incredibly important for your mental wellbeing and your health, which is why a few days after quitting smoking you'll get super intense, vivid dreams. This is your body catching up on all of the lost REM sleep. If you previously relied on cannabis to fall asleep, try waking up early, exercising throughout the day, reading before bed time, taking small amounts of melatonin, and sleeping in a cold, completely dark room. If you can't sleep, get up and read until you feel ok to try again. Over time your sleep gets better and you start to feel the fog lifting, but it takes some time.

4)If you are currently suffering from any sort of mental illness and using cannabis, I'd highly suggest giving it up for good. After a few months of making better decisions, getting good sleep, and being sober I came to a place where I really enjoyed the peace of mind I have when I'm sober and I felt everything became easier to manage. I got off my benzos 6 months in(no matter how bad it gets I refuse to take antidepressants) and started to deal with my problems proactively instead or reacting to them with drugs. Waning off benzos was even worse than coming off weed but I felt like I could push through it. I started to feel like I wasn't in such a dark place. Things were looking up. If you have a therapist, please speak to them about wanting to quit cannabis cold turkey. They're able to help you in ways I can't and can have super helpful insight. 

5) Relationships become much easier to manage with a clear head and newfound confidence. Even if you suffer from anxiety, try patching your relationship with your family, even if your relationship with them is great. Please note that by family I don't mean blood relatives. Anyone who cares deeply about you is family. If you dont have any such people in your life yet, this can be a great opportunity to reach out and make connections. 


Tldr: Didn't have a super long relationship with weed but am young enough for it to have an impact on my mind. After my life fell apart, I quit smoking weed, tobacco and taking benzos by exercising when cravings hit, splashing cold water on my face and reaching out to people in my life. Quitting isn't easy, but if one person took one thing away from this post I'd love for them to understand quitting is worth it."
"Life On Hard Mode When you’re constantly high, you think you’re playing life on easy mode. You think you are escaping the inherent dread of human existence. Yet, what you don’t realize is that nothing in life comes free. Daily use is not a form of escape but rather imprisonment. You become nothing but a slave to impulse and your little rat brain will do just about anything to justify your addiction. 

Every task that should be simple becomes difficult. Every relationship you once cherished becomes strained. Every hobby you once enjoyed becomes boring. All the money you work so hard to earn gets flushed down the drain. With each exhale, everything that once made you you evaporates. 

It is clear this is no way to live life. Yet, it took me over two years to realize this. 

Here’s to day 3."
"Start becoming addicted to clarity of mind The title says it all.

The brain fog and numbness we all crave from weed are just misguided methods for us to feel more at home with ourselves and our Being. 

From the tumultuous negative emotions all the way to blissed-out euphoria, learn to love it all and accept whatever the moment delivers to your doorstep. Dance with the anxiety and cravings. Let the unpleasant thoughts in for tea instead of always trying to slam the door in their faces. They are impersonal, passing visitors who you can learn from.

In other words, let go of the need to 'control' your states of consciousness. We grasp so hard onto 'how things should be' we hardly ever truly appreciate how things *are,* right now.

Cultivate that awareness. You will feel more yourself. You will feel more alive. 

“You can’t avoid the waves but you can learn to surf”

It takes a tremendous amount of courage and strength. But I believe in all of you. So much <3 "
"Embrace boredom. If you embrace it, it’s no longer an excuse. Learn to be quiet with yourself. Pick up an instrument or a pencil or a book. Make something. Write a poem. Even if it’s stupid. 
Go for a walk. Learn the leaves on the different trees. 
If you embrace boredom, you are embracing your own mind when it’s quiet. 
You never have to be bored again. 
I have to remind myself this.

"It's become too much. I need to Leave. My life is good.  
I'm 42, wife, kids, work, hobbies... good times.  
But the weed is too much.  
Booze too.  
My brother died suddenly 2.5 years ago and it magnified my weed and drinking.  
Covid came in and cast it's shadow. Now I am certain I need to stop smoking weed completely.

I've been smoking daily since my late twenties.

It's become too much. I can't manage my moods.

All of your stories have inspired me. But I need help.  
It's really wound itself into my habits.  
How do I start?"
"got an unexpected drug test today I’m 16 weeks pregnant and the obgyn nurse said “it’s time for a drug test!” and I laughed and thought BRING IT ON! 

I successfully quit smoking weed on 11/11/19 after a 20 year daily habit. got pregnant 5 weeks later. Hardly miss it. I’m so grateful I had the mental fortitude to quit. I’d be so ashamed to show a positive but today it was all NEGATIVE across the board ❤️

feeling proud of myself"
"Time to lower the difficulty level. Smoking weed everyday and being productive is playing on hard mode, some people are just too good at the game and can play this way forever, but since you’re here I assume you lost a few levels. Time to lower the difficulty, and try, although hard at first - to enjoy the simplicity of easy mode."
"It’s bigger than your withdrawal symptoms. Your head ache or sour stomach isn’t the thing that makes you relapse. It’s the whole habit of avoiding discomfort and hard truths about yourself and your relationships. Think about that next time you want to smoke. Is it the shitty feeling in your body? Or are you stuck in a cycle of numbing yourself to pain? 

You have the power to break that cycle, and knowing that can make you get through the headache and the insomnia way more easily. Good luck!"
The day I run out of weed The day that I completely run out it’s almost as if I’m realizing my impending doom that is “weed withdrawal” I immediately get saddened by the idea that I won’t have weed to cocoon me into comfort. I must now face my deeply embedded problems face on. The only thing to make me feel more comfortable is reminding myself that it gets better.
"""There's only us, there's only this. Forget regret, or life is yours to miss. No other road, no other way, no day but today."" Being sober is the most wonderful gift you can give yourself. You finally meet the person you were meant to be, full of life and beautiful emotions. No more hiding, no more running away. I've quit weed and alcohol all together and looking back now, I never want to numb myself ever again. Especially now I know what it's like when it's ""just me"". 

I have smoked and drunk excessively for fifteen years straight and what seemed impossible in the past is now actually happening. I am sober for 2,5 months and couldn't be happier.
I wish you the same, wherever you may be on your journey. Just know that everything is possible and you should never lose hope and faith. The cravings will pass and you are beautiful and strong, just the way you are. ♡ 

I feel grateful for all the love and support on this sub. Reading all your stories when feeling challenged at times meant more to me than words can say. So cheers to you fellow Leavers, stay strong for we are in this journey together. ♡"
"I've stayed sober from weed a year today. I'm pretty proud of this accomplishment. Before I quit, I was mentally addicted to smoking up. Now I've been sober for a year today, and I'm convinced it was the best decision of my life so far."
"Seven lies I told myself I am on my 5th day of total sobriety, after months of tapering down with vaping only.

In order to sustain my addiction, I told myself many lies:

1. ""I need weed to enjoy food."" *Wrong. It made me seek out garbage food which is engineered to taste good but has poor nutritional value. I've discovered how great fresh, nutritious food can taste! Junk food is an addiction of its own.*
2. ""I need weed to sleep."" *Very, very wrong. Weed disrupts REM sleep. One night without REM sleep is fine. Years without it is hell.*
3. ""I need weed to be creative."" *I have creative hobbies. Weed makes me lazy and okay with not working on them. If anything, it makes me less creative.*
4. ""If my friends smoke weed, I need to too."" *I used to live with roommates who were fine with smoking all the time. It was a continuation of my college days where we'd all smoke together. Something better left for fond memories, not carried well into adulthood.*
5. ""If I can't handle life, it's not weed's fault, it's mine."" *Probably one of the most insidious. For the longest time I believed that weed has no negative mental health effects. The r/trees subreddit is dangerous in this way... people there are so used to advocating for legalization, they take it too far and lie about the negative effects.*
6. ""I don't have a lot of free time."" *Oh yes I do, I just smoke it away. Life's clock is ticking. I can either live a waking dream, or give up this fantasy and become the person I've always wanted to be.*
7. ""I need to enjoy myself every night."" *This is the hardest lie to face. A life of leisure may be the dream for some, but not for me. I aspire to be better every day, and develop my skills to their fullest.*

I got promoted a month ago. I took on many new responsibilities. My job requires me to be sharp, present, and responsive. All these qualities are marred by weed. There was no way my habits would allow me to do my job well. My sleep schedule was a joke, my temperament was poor, and I was often a stuttering mess during meetings. So I knew it had to go for good.

This got me thinking about other paths I want to walk in life. I want to have kids someday. I thought of what it would be like to be high while my kid was hurt or sick. It would make me horrible parent.

If I keep smoking and eating garbage, I'll never achieve the physique I want.

I want to take my creative pursuits to the next level. I'll never have the discipline to do this if I keep my habit.

The promotion was the last shock I needed. It's over, I'm not lying to myself anymore. You might see in my post history that [I tried quitting over a year ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/9krr2d/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_i_wont_smoke_today_either/). I failed, because I was still lying to myself, and I had some severe emotional problems to work through. I'll post more about this soon. One of the first steps to evaluating your weed habit is to take inventory of all the things you tell yourself about it, because they could well be lies."
I miss you I miss everything about you. The excitement of buying you and bringing you home. The anticipation of smoking. I miss ripping my bong and feeling the smoke fill my lungs. I miss getting faded off carts all day. I miss feeling the wave of comfort as I get high. I miss getting cottonmouth and drinking the most refreshing water. I miss getting munchies and eating till my stomach hurts. But I’m better off I guess. 5 weeks sober y’all
"This is the time I quit for good. I'm afraid of what comes next. 8 days clean. I'm not going back. I know that. And that's why I'm so scared right now. Weed was my companion, my therapy, my peace, my life. And for a while, it kind of worked. 

That's the thing about weed—it keeps you so subdued that you *almost* don't care who it's made you. *Almost*. If it weren't for that *almost* none of us would be here. But we know better. We know it's not right to need a bowl before sleep every night. We know it's not good to smoke a J on every occasion, good and bad. We know it's not healthy to only have friendships based on a drug. Hell, we know it's not good to ruminate on it all like this, but it's so goddamn hard to stop.

I don't know what problems you've been neglecting. But if you're here, you probably have a long list. For me, my social anxiety has spiraled into a black hole of loneliness. My depression greets me each month with a new layer of sadness that leaves me yearning for the last. My OCD intrudes new corners of my mind I thought were inaccessible before. And it just hurts, you know? They say mental pain feels like physical pain, and I really get that right now. Maybe you do too.

I'm starting to believe that's what keeps us smoking every time we go back. Not the fear of losing weed in our lives, but the fear of facing our lives head on. And the longer we avoid our problems, the scarier they become. It's not about weed at all. It's about our problems.

And that's why we have to stop. We owe it to ourselves to be terrified, to suffer, to mourn. To face rejection and pain and sadness. To let the lows be lows, so the highs can be real, not drug-induced. It's gonna suck. But we really do owe it to ourselves to suffer right now. We really do.

The thing is, the same way we snowballed ourselves into this situation is the same way we get out. If we can get this shit out of our systems, we'll have more motivation to keep going on without it. If we solve one tiny little problem in our lives, it'll give us the fuel to solve another. And another. And another. And so on. And really, that's happiness right there—solving your problems. It doesn't come *after* you solve them. It comes *as* you solve them. Because after you do, another set just falls in your lap anyways. 

I'm saying this for myself as much as I am anyone else: happiness is closer than you think. But it has to start here."
"Met with a therapist today - surprised by the response on withdrawal I've been using to self-medicate for many many years and my quit has prompted me to start treating my mental health seriously. I've been open with my therapist about how I can't tell where I'm at emotionally due to the mood swings and general instability. 

I was surprised when she told me how seriously the mental health community is treating marijuana addiction and withdrawal now. How I will need to detox completely before any honest evaluation can be done because of the affect to my brain chemistry. 

I thought I was going crazy. It was amazing to feel heard I guess, particularly about the withdrawal symptoms. So many people have told me about the 'safety' of pot in regards to other drugs or otherwise tried to minimize the affects. 

She estimated that it would take around 6 months for my brain to return to homeostasis. 

Keep this in mind if you're on the fence about quitting."
"When life gets you down, you don’t get high. You fight, motherfuckers. You fight. "
"It's 4/20. Let's celebrate sobriety. How has not smoking improved your life? For me, it's been the ability to finally reach goals I set for myself, but never was able to achieve because I would get high and get an ""ah fuck it"" mentality. I've lost the weight I wanted because I stopped getting late night munchies. I've been able to focus and do more with my day because I'm not getting lethargic or complacent with sitting on a couch mindlessly redditing or playing videogames. As well as doing other things like planning and executing trips and vacations I wouldn't have otherwise planned, because I had spent all my money on weed or was content staying in for the weekend, getting high.

I relapsed a few weeks ago after a 32 day streak, now 3 weeks in, and ready to go the full 90 days.

I think we all could use some extra motivation today. Share your story!"
"If you think weed will make it all better, remember that getting high is like putting on a blindfold in front of your problems: you know theyre still there and you cant see how much they pile up until the blindfold comes off. Then when you take it off, you find yourself surrounded..
What are you going to do, surrender?

Or are you gonna stand the fuck up for yourself, accept that you let these problems linger for too long and tackle them?

Like your eyes, you need sobriety to see things the way they are and to achieve anything. Being sober is *fantastic* when you deal with your problems effectively.

I gotta say, it feels so fucking good to accomplish things that have been gnawing at the back of your mind for a while, especially after quitting weed. Thats the cherry on top. 

Im about to reach two months in and yet im nowhere near out of the danger zone of relapsing; there is so much on my plate that i still need to get done yet:
I still gotta keep my grades, gotta apply for university, gotta eat right, gotta get in better physical condition, gotta make new/better friends, gotta save up my money for a truck, gotta learn how to fix my bike, and plenty of other shit.

Youd be lying to yourself if you think you have nothing to do with your time other than smoke weed. Its important to have some sort of mental checklist throughout this process. It helps keep you preoccupied with your actual goals rather than getting high and putting them off until god knows when.

One thing that i realized is that its not all gonna happen overnight, and its gonna take quite some time to shape my habits in order to get some things squared away. In the meantime, i will **not** be smoking marijuana. I cannot do it all with a blindfold on. I need my eyes.

Just remember that when you accomplish everything you need to get done sober, then there is no need for the blindfold anymore."
I don't fantasize about one little hit. I know that would make me feel like garbage almost instantly. I fantasize about a full blown relapse so I can feel nothing at all again. Which is exactly why I can **never** smoke again (Day 76.5)
"Smoking could be masking health symptoms that you should be noticing. I am a heavy smoker. Like hit the bowl as soon as I get out of bed and every moment of the day until I go to sleep smoker. I also have  post-treatment Lyme disease which makes me fatigued and sick a lot of the time. I quit weed and caffeine about a month ago and cigarettes about 3 months ago and I have noticed something interesting. I feel like shit. I thought I would feel energized once I quit putting all of the substances into my body but I realize that the Lyme disease definitely has a hold on me. The reason I'm writing this is because maybe some of you have been discounting your feelings of fatigue and attributing them to smoking weed a lot when it's actually an underlying health condition. It was easy for me to say that I was super fatigued all the time because of the pot smoking and it allowed me to ignore some of the symptoms of my disease. Just a heads up, friends."
"I used to think I had an anxiety disorder until I quit weed... I went years without going more than 24 hours without weed. But when I did give it a day without weed i would have horrific anxiety. Like 7/10 close to a full blown panicked attack, which would last until I smoked again. 

So naturally for years I was always under the impression that I had an anxiety disorder and weed helped it.

It's only when I quit weed and suffered thorough a week of withdrawelz and bruuuuuuuuutal panick attacks, insomnia, sweating , rapid heart beat all day and just a general feeling of doom and fear ..........

Is that I now realise WEED WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ANXIETY. if I didn't smoke for a while then obviously I would start to withdraw (believe me I never even beleived you could experience withdrawels on weed), and for me the main symtpon of withdrawal is anxiety.

Now I'm on the other side of the withdrawal for the most part and I have 0 anxiety about anything. Sat in bed and my heart beat is super slow and super gentle and I'm just super chilled out. 

So good to know there was nothing wrong with me after all these years and all I had to do was to stop smoking weed 😂😂"
"As ridiculous as South Park is, I've never heard such a real opinion on weed. This is words of wisdom coming from nobody else than Randy Marsh, I hope you enjoy it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_pSXV8S-Gw"
"1 week without smoking!!! I’m so proud to say that at midnight, it will officially be one week since I’ve stopped smoking weed after doing it everyday for 3 years. My mind is much more clear, I feel very well rested in the morning, and I’m just overall more content. The first few days were awful- couldn’t sleep for more than a couple of hours, couldn’t eat anything, felt nauseous all the time, etc... Now, however, I feel so much better. So to anyone who really wants to quit but is afraid to- just know it gets easier everyday. I know my journey is far from over, but the fact that I can now eat, sleep, and feel joy without weed is a high in itself. I hope everyone is doing well, and if anyone ever needs someone to talk to, feel free to reach out!!"
"260 days weed free! I’m so proud of myself This sub was such a good resource in the early months for me. I went cold turkey and haven’t looked back. I’ve had many dreams where I’ve accidentally done it. But oh yea, I dream so much now and I love that. I’m also dealing with so many issues in my life finally that I used to use weed to escape from/not feel. It’s very much worth it to go on this journey, keep with it! Weed kept me stagnant too long and was a bad way to deal with my emotions. 

Anyways thanks the support. I didn’t think I could give it up before — stay on track ya’ll, it’s worth it!"
"50 years on weed I had my first joint in 1969. 30 years of almost daily use. I live in Holland so the dopeshop is just around the corner. Now finished my first week without. Mood swings, tears, chain smoking cigarettes. No support around me. My son suggested I join th s community so here I am.. ."
"I was using cannabis to deal with depression. Now that I've quit, I'M SO DEPRESSED The subject is tl;dr

I've been clean for about 5 weeks now. Prior to that I was a heavy user for 20 years. For the last 5 years I had been dabbing about a gram a day.
I was diagnosed with CHS about 10 years ago but deeply in denial and didn't quit until recently.

During the first week sober I felt terrible, of course.
After about ten days I felt amazing. My appetite came back, the constant feeling of sickness went away and I am once again able to enjoy foods that would previously trigger an episode of vomiting. I can even drink a little coffee and alcohol again, which is basically a miracle because for years those things have triggered intense vomiting and pain. At first, I felt the cloud of depression lift and I thought ""I am cured!"" 

The euphoria didn't last long. Now I feel more depressed than ever.
Prior to quitting I would bribe myself with dabs to get myself to work every morning. Since I've quit I've missed a surprising amount of work because I'm just too depressed to get out of bed. I struggle to do basic things like shower and feed myself. 

I'm happy to be over the hump but one thing I did not realize was how much I have been using cannabis to mask my severe depression.
I've had episodes of severe depression when I was using as well, but it wasn't as noticeable because I got really, really high to mask the symptoms. It was easy to blame being tired and useless on the weed instead of being depressed. Kind of like the pot was an excuse to myself for why I acted and felt this way. 

I have a great therapist and I go to therapy once a week. I also joined a gym and I force myself to workout for at least an hour a day. These things help take the edge off the depression but it still weighs on me, like wearing a wet coat that nobody else can see.

This post isn't really a question (or an answer) regarding quitting. I just wanted to share my experience with others who have quit and may be feeling the same way."
"Your life literally depends on your not smoking. We all have the greatest version of ourselves lying in a haze of pain, discomfort, and not knowing what will happen in our future.

Your most confident version. Your most successful version. Your most charming version. Your most athletic version. Your most productive version.

Imagine your future self sad and tearful over the fact that you didn't stop smoking in your youth. Imagine how agonizing it would be to not get that time back. To know that you had the potential but just smoked yourself into a haze.

Be nice to your future self. "
"For Those of You Browsing Leaves..High.. I know for a fact there are an increasing number of people lurking this subreddit, but unable to make the commitment. I was one of you. 

This post is for those who--one way or another--ended up on this side of reddit, and think it might be a wakeup call for them.

It goes something like this--

**1st time visiting leaves**- *""Wow, there's a group of people that are trying to quit using pot? That's odd. How did I end up here again? Hmm..all of these people are struggling with quitting. I'm a pretty productive stoner. <takes a hit>""*

**2nd,3rd,4th time visiting leaves** - *""Hey I remember this place. <takes a hit>. Wow..this guy is claiming his anxiety and depression went away after he quit smoking. This one too. I know so many people that have used weed to clean up their own life, lol, even me. Weed is great, I don't have a problem. Weed is the only thing keeping me sane in this world. It's truly a miracle. <takes a hit>. It makes eating better, it makes sleeping better. Hell, I can't even talk with people without weed! Weed makes everything easier and more fun.""*

**5th time+ visiting leaves** - *""Okay why am I guilt tripping myself? I'm not these people. I don't have a problem. Weed makes my life so much better than it was...and besides, I could quit if I wanted to. I get all my shit done. Sure I have anxiety and depression, and yeah it's hard to find someone to date who also smokes as much as me..and yeah I have to hide it from my family and coworkers...but they just don't understand. Weed isn't the problem. I'm not the problem. They are...<takes a hit>..""*

You get the point. After lurking on leaves for probably 1 year+, and over 25-30 visits, I finally realized I was engaging in *self-deception*. Self deception is telling the doctor that you only drink 5 alcoholic beverages a week, when subconciously you know that you drank well over 10 last week (I have no idea about alcoholism, i'm just using random numbers). Self-deception is the voice of the addiction that says ""It's really not that big of a deal."" or ""John smokes twice as much as me and is a drug dealer, i'm a respectable citizen, I'm not addicted."" Self-deception is NOT something you are concious of...self-deception is something that your therapist will help you uncover (or hopefully this post..). Generally speaking, someone who is facing addiction will have 2 voices going on in their head. One will be a self-deceiving, justifying voice that says it's okay. Another voice will be standing to the side, urging you to take a moment to look at the facts surrounding your life. The second voice knows that something isn't right, and that there's a power struggle--a war going on in the mind.

This post is not to shame marijuana enthusiasts. This post is hopefully going to help ONE person who really needs to evaluate their relationship with weed. I don't know if that's you. But I can support you and answer questions if you're curious. If you don't have problems with weed, awesome. Seriously, that's great. But if you keep finding yourself ending up here over and over again...carefully examine your life...there might be a reason your mind keeps guiding you to this page.

**Are you controlling weed? Or is weed controlling you?**

Ask yourself the following (These won't be easy to answer honestly..):

* When's the last time I have been offered a joint, and said no?

* When's the last time I have enjoyed a hobby sober?

* When's the last time I have visited with friends and family, and enjoyed their company sober?

* When's the last time I have run out of weed, and been okay with it? Did I contact friends to see if they had some?

* Do I assosiate the things that I love, *with* weed? Aka, friendships are based on smoking, hobbies are based on being high for creativity, food and sleep are proportionally related to the amount of thc circulating through my nervous system...you get the idea.

* I get the gut feeling that something is wrong, but I often push it down and justify my use until I forget about it. Later on, I remember my gut feeling and have to work to push it away again...

* I often feel like getting high when i'm sober, but when i'm high I don't feel all that great...sure it feels good but a part of me feels like something is off. In order to try and avoid this feeling, I often smoke again before getting sober. 

* Do I often find myself scraping every last scrap of cannabis from my grinders/glass because I want to get high but don't have the money to buy more? Have I ever sold something of value or traded something for cannabis? Do I have an income that supports cannabis usage at my current level?

* When choosing a significant other, does weed play a role? If my loved ones mention my relationship with cannabis, do I defend myself or do I listen? 

**If you felt uncomfortable answering these questions, PLEASE evaluate your relationship with cannabis. You may be engaging in self-deception, just like me.**

It's not an easy pill to swallow, it took me years to admit how big of an impact it had on my life. Again, the last thing I want to do is guilt trip anyone right now. This community is ready to support you in every way, if you are ready. Best of luck, friends.

"Today I went biking at Venice beach and it reeked of weed And while smelling it, I realized that weed can help and enhance other peoples lives, just not mine, and I am okay with that, and I am happy with that."
"so glad i found this sub i've been wanting to quit for a while now, i used to be a very confident girl who loved nothing more than chatting to anyone and everyone. i started in university and smoked to the point where i totally flunked third year because i was an anxious mess that couldnt leave the house, paranoid thay everyone hated me. i've smoked 2-3 joints every day for the last 7 years and i finally had enough this week.

my mental health hasnt been great for a long time and i have always used weed as a crutch while also knowing that it was probably the main cause of my anxiety disorder. my self esteem and confidence have been wrecked and i've been told i'm a shadow of the person i used to be. i've always had a job but always felt like an imposter with this dirty secret which contributed to my low self worth and anxiety. 

i had a major panic attack a few nights ago that was triggered by a small joint before bed and i was flung into another attack as soon as i woke up. so i jumped into bed with my mother and we chatted about things until i eventually calmed down and something came over me. i grabbed my jar of weed, gave it to my mum and told her to hide it from me, (something i have NEVER had the guts to do before because the thought of not having weed would put me on edge) but something clicked in my head and i just dont want it anymore because it's ruining me. 

i'm currently on day three and had a really bad day, i felt like my mind and body were screaming at me for weed so i thought there MUST be a reddit thread to help with this, and here i am. this sub is exactly the type of thing i need, a support group to remind me that i am not alone in this, i have not ruined myself for life, and i can get back to the old me as long as i stick with it. i just want to say thank you in advance because this sub is already helping me just reading through others' experiences which made me want to share mine so far :) 

p. s. i'm surprised at how fast i've started dreaming again when i've had nothing but silence and darkness for 7 years, i forgot how real they feel!"
"Recieved an E-mail Today from myself one year ago So I recently stopped smoking cannabis (again) and it has been pretty tough. I'm on day 3 and having trouble. Today I woke up to an e-mail I wrote myself a year ago on [futureme.org](https://futureme.org). It's a website that allows you to set a specific date and time to send an e-mail to yourself in the future. A year ago today I had stopped smoking, and the e-mail was to congratulate me on one year smoke-free. My girlfriend and I just had a long talk about why this time was so hard, and we came to the conclusion that it was because I wasn't replacing pot with anything. I was just abstaining and it wasn't really working. I was still a bum on the couch. The timing on this is just such a coincidence that I see it as a sign. It helped me see what the positives are from not smoking, and that I have to get back into my hobbies in order to deal with the withdrawal symptoms and to really start practicing my recovery. It helped me see that I'm not doing this for my GF, my Mom, or anyone else; I'm doing this for me and for my benefit. I can't rely on my desire to please someone else to give me motivation, because that is not going to cut it in the long run. I have to take this journey for myself. 

&#x200B;

I really just couldn't believe that I just had a long conversation about the very same thing I wrote in an e-mail a year ago and received it today as soon as I woke up. I just wanted to share that. Maybe someone up there is looking out for me, maybe it's just a coincidence. But I choose to believe the former. Have a great day everyone, and good luck on your journey."
"Day 365! Almost let it come and go without realizing it but after a 30 year daily habit today is 365 days without cannabis. Hard to believe really. For those of you on the road to this day I wish you well. If I can do it anyone can. And for all of you who have posted your trials, tribulations and successes here I want to thank you all big time. This sub has been an incredible source of strength and support and absolutely integral to me reaching this milestone. Much love to you all!"
"24 Days Sober From Everything 10 Years Heavy Use. 24 Days No THC. I used to smoke weed all day everyday and knew I had a serious problem. I could not stop for the life of me. Then I stopped smoking weed and switched to vaping. At first it was great. I wasn't coughing up tar anymore. Then after a few months it was none stop vaping THC. It got so out of control. I've been depressed but feeling better overall. It's been one tough motherfucking battle, no lie. I almost gave up on week 1. Now I can't see myself going back. 🤟"
"Goodbye cannabis, it's time to move on and resume self growth. Apathy towards life and weed are inseparable for me it seems. I enjoy being creative and productive so much more than being monged out from the dank. Does anyone else agree? It feels like weed disconnects you from yourself. (Wrote this in a notebook a good while ago..)


I feel my true self is lost in a maze. 

I can't get out, I can't see through the haze.

This cannabis kiss got me in a superficial blissful daze

haven't felt the joy of clarity in days

no, months!?

Goddamn, why can't I lay off on the blunts

Actually, its been years, since I was 14.

I feel I've been in a dream for 4 years

I've drifted so far from my peers

I hope one day the dust clears 

I hope I wake up from this dream

I hope one day my mind will feel pristine

But it seems unlikely due to all the coke, xans and ketamine. 

All I can do is hope...

Time to be clean."
"day 60 - an honest pro/con list PROS:

&#x200B;

\-education: can sit and focus on homework for longer periods of time because i'm not getting high to ""enjoy it more"", ""find it more interesting"", ""relax"" while risking paradoxical effects like racing thoughts, easily distracted, more interested in other things and then crashing and losing interest all together, getting sleepy, losing focus, becoming mildly anxious and depressed. now i can just......do homework and enjoy the content. furthermore, i can seek outside content. I can open up a web page and seek an article, google a definition, order a book without falling down a rabbit hole of distraction. finally, i'm not procrastinating. i don't have to spend time and money on the pursuit of weed anymore. i wake up excited for coffee and water and all of a sudden i'm naturally getting my shit done and this snow balls into more productivity.

\-relationships: i am present. i'm not fighting racing thoughts while holding a conversation. i'm not dodging eye contact because i'm paranoid my eyes are blood shot and eyelids heavy. i'm NOT LOSING MY THOUGHTS MID-SENTENCE - i seriously cannot believe this doesn't happen to me anymore. I'm witty again, i'm funny as hell. i'm intrinsically motivated to hear from others - to cherish others. i'm less negative about the world - i'm not walking around with a chip on my shoulder hyperfixated on the heavy sadness of others and the harsh possibilities out there - i always attributed this outlook to my naturally depressive disposition and intensely empathetic mind. nah man, it was just a side effect of weed - an apathy and paranoia toward the world. now my mind is naturally orienting toward beauty and happy moments - i never thought this could happen to me. i'm spending time with family, i'm not avoiding ill family members, i'm reaching out to old friends, i'm answering texts and DMs immediately rather than letting them sit for weeks just to never return. i planned a trip and ordered a game - i was present during these visits instead of planning when to smoke or planning the visit TO smoke. i'm no longer obsessed with ents - i'm obsessed with friendship. I feel better about myself. i was a crippled shell of a person while chronically smoking - i felt spotlight effect constantly, like everything i did and said in a group setting was dumb and everyone was staring. i no longer avoid group activities with the same ferocity.

\-work: i'm doing the most. because i want to. i'm not ""just getting by"" and fulfilling deadlines. i'm taking my professional and expertise seriously. i'm dressing for the occasion. i'm meditating before work (instead of smoking and planning the high out), i'm packing a lunch instead of ordering food or not eating everyday. i'm pursuing knowledge of superiors and uplifting coworkers because i'm not sad and negative anymore and i'm not paranoid. i'm sleeping better (still a struggle) but when i do sleep, its deeply.

\-health: i'm not using weed to support the pursuit of my eating disorder. i'm eating meals regularly and im in tune with slip ups in my recovery. i quit the gym (i was using it to get high and walk like a zombie to avoid everyone in my life while feeling false productivity). I will return to the gym someday but for now i set up a mat in my room to quietly get back to exercise for the right reasons - for health, not avoidance and vanity. im drinking coffee to enjoy it - not to suck it down to avoid a crash.

\-money: MONEY IN THA BANK

\-more pros include sex (sex was great on weed but sex has been amazing off weed), dreams (fucking christ i love the intense dreams. its proof im sleeping, its like living 6 different lives), reading books (i can actually read), art (i thought my creativity would diminish but its revitalized and focused), pride (pride of the knowledge i'm capable of sobriety and self-reliance)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

CONS (some of which include pros):

&#x200B;

\-education: i'm dealing with the mental realization that my 1.5 year grad degree was pushed to 3 years due to chronic weed use. i had previously attributed it to external factors like money, time, professors not helping me out. nahhhh, it was my inability to plan, to keep up, to gather motivation, to focus. i just need to stop beating myself up to this. it'll come with time

\-relationships: i miss smoking with people because it was a collective sort of ""between us"" thing. it was a weird type of bond to escape alongside someone else. whether that be ents or SO or best friends. this has been the biggest con and my toughest point of almost relapsing.

\-music: music and entertainment in general while smoking were pretty dope because i could hear every beat and fixate on videos/TV/movies. music is beginning to come back to me and a pro is that i'm seeking out more and more music. it might be a pro that im not so into other entertainment because im getting outside more now. and you know what? the quiet time i have now is.....beautiful and necessary.

\-unwinding: we all know there is no physical relief like that of an external substance over taking your body (the relief of that first puff, falling over all your muscles). well, it wasn't worth the mental anguish that short term and very brief relief gave me. now my whole day feels like relief.

&#x200B;

i'll edit this if i think of anymore salient ones. but overall, its beyond worth it. i have my personality back and my life back. i have my spark back.

&#x200B;

edit: i been pondering all day and one last con i can think of is: ciggs. i quit drinking when i quit smoking. and i quit xanax a bit before that. so now i'm sober. i smoke ciggs during social events to cope. makes me feel gross but fills a void. the good thing is because i kicked alcohol, weed, and xanax, i know i can motherfucking kick dumbass cigs. that is all, thank you."
One year clean today! That is all. 😊
"Today l am 5 years free from cannabis addiction It feels really good to hit this milestone, which l could never have imagined at the time. If you’re curious about my background l wrote a long post at [6 Months](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1t4pmh/6_months_detailed_story_ama/?st=JI9NMJ2V&sh=71df70e6https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1t4pmh/6_months_detailed_story_ama/?st=JI9NMJ2V&sh=71df70e6)

After five years l am living a completely different life now. Often with big milestones you hear people say “it feels like just yesterday” but for me it feels like a very long time ago because the growth I’ve experienced has been so massive. 

Most days l don’t think about it at all, and “ex-stoner”  just isn’t a significant part of my identity. Which is an unbelievable transformation because the drug was everything to me when l was still smoking, and quitting was a massive challenge that felt impossible.

For those of you who are struggling, know that this is (hopefully) one of the hardest things you will do. It can take a long time for the work to pay off but it is so worth it. 

Few people will understand how difficult this is, so if no one has said it to you yet, congratulations on making the choice to prioritize your well-being, l know how hard you’re working right now, and you’re doing a great job.

I know that when l quit it was always helpful to hear from others and know that it was possible to build a life without weed, so free to ask me any questions about my long-term recovery experience. 

"
"Took Someone I deeply care about leaving me to see what the stranglehold weed has had on my life. I've been struggling to quit, until now. Today is my day one of a weed free life. (long post) My ex recently broke up with me. There were a number of reasons behind it, but one that stuck out was her saying how irritable i'd get from time to time, and how we'd only hang out when I wanted to, which made her feel forced to hang out on some days where she just wanted to have some time to herself. And it made me reflect on what she meant, as I didn't see the issues. 

&#x200B;

She doesn't smoke weed so whenever we hung out, I wasn't smoking. I am a going on to be 4 year daily user, I haven't been sober for anymore then 12-48 hours at a time in that 4 years. So whenever we'd hang out for a long period of time, i'd get cranky and moody, never understood why. I do now, now that i've had time to think it through, it was the weed. There were times where i'd try to get her out of the apartment so I could be by myself and get high, just because I could. I wouldn't be spontaneous with seeing her either, only hanging out when it was convenient for me (aka, when I wasn't baked out of my mind) 

&#x200B;

The annoyance and irritability has also spilled over to other facets of life as well. If i'm not baked, i'm cranky, short with people and just a bitter ass person. A shell of who I was before I started down this path. I understand why she dumped me. Which is why I vowed to get better. I've been working on other issues in my life (such as NoFap) and a little over two weeks into that, I'm ready to start taking on another beast that has taken over the drivers seat of my life. So, with me finishing off my stash last night, I'm officially quitting as of today. It's going to be a harsh, lonely journey as all my friends smoke. But i'm glad I at least have this subreddit in my corner for support. Let's do this."
"Through tears and pain, here I am. "
"Edibles My partner got weed delivered today, without me knowing, till we got a random knock on the door. He got a bunch of edibles & asked me if I wanted some. I was so close to saying yes, but I walked away, read some posts I saved from here, & remembered why I quit, how it made me feel, & how great it’s been being sober. I came back & told him no thanks, & am so proud of myself(: I’ve only been sober 12 days, but this is the longest I’ve gone in 2 years, & I’m not giving up now just to “have some fun”, when I know how crappy it’ll make me feel. Felt the need to post it here to look back, if I ever get tempted again. Can’t wait to keep going.

Edit: Wow... Thank you soso much for all the sweet, supportive comments(: & thanks so much for my first award!!"

"4 months clean off weed Hey there r/Leaves community, it's me again checking in after 4 months weed-free. 

I got on this sub right when I started my rehab program and used to write to people every night. It was super helpful to me because sending encouragement to others also encourages me. I haven't been here in a while but the four month milestone is a nice reason to celebrate. Give me a high five!

I continue to be SO HAPPY that I am not smoking weed every day. I'm so much more motivated to 'do my life.' I'm not depressed anymore. I enjoy people more. Things that seemed overwhelming are falling into place. I wanted to collaborate with people more, instead of doing everything by myself -- and I am collaborating with at least 2 different people in my career now. I used to be a Loner Stoner and now I have a lot more people in my life, which makes me happier.

The first 2 months of sobriety were marked by incredible irritation and annoyance with everything. The 2nd and 3rd months had a lot of anger and rage. This month I notice I'm so much calmer and happier. 

Not out of the woods yet, though. I am working on my childhood traumas with a therapist, (= lots of crying). I'm trying to move forward on the really important blocks that keep me from achieving what I really desire. Blocks I just ran away from when I was using. Now I'm not using, and I'm chipping away at them. 

Good luck out there, all you Leavers! Let me know how you are doing. 

\-Julie"
Exactly one year since I quit weed. Really proud of myself for this! A year ago I quit weed and replaced it with yoga and meditation and it was the best decision I've ever made. This community was really helpful. Happy to answer any questions about the process if anyone has any.
"A letter to marijuana You gave me the best illusion that you were helping me. I trusted you. I held on to you. You were always there for me during my hardest and darkest times. I could always count on you to lift me up when things felt intolerable or when I just needed some company. You filled me with so many beautiful lies about how much better I looked and performed around you. I believed it all.

But what you didn't tell me was that you needed a part of me, every time you were there for me. As soon as I turned my back, you quietly and sneakily tore off a part  of my happiness, peace, laughter and desire to live, love and feel. You even asked me to make a sacrifice; leave behind any thing else that made me happy and forget about others around me. I devoted myself to you. I don't know if I could ever forgive you for taking so much from me and for making me feel like I need you. You took so much of me that I became invisible. I could not find myself anymore, even when I looked in mirrors. I only saw despair. 

 How could you deceive me like this? You would take me on so many magical trips ...our private get a ways...but you never quite took me back to my home. You left me in a lonely hole. A hole you dug deeper each time I saw you. I did not know your intention was to ultimately bury me in it. And so, I would continue to trust you because those trips felt so much better than being confined in that dark, troublesome hole where I only kept sinking. Where I had to sit with myself, my emotions, reality. It made me anxious. It made me want to runaway on another trip with you. I could not fathom feeling anything but the touch of you on my lips.

 Just. one.more.trip. 

but now I'm so deep in this hole that it has gotten hard to breathe. I know if I run away with you, you're going to continue digging it deeper until I can no longer see any light above me or have any air to breathe.

I have to get out of here. I can't stay here forever under your rule. But I have to get out myself and with no help from you. You lied and took more of me than I could have ever imagined. But you don't get to take any more. You have taken enough. And I need me back. I miss me. I miss living out in the real world. This hole is caving in.

 I saw the real you in your wicked smile every time you lowered me a little deeper into the hole.  You told me it was temporary but it never was. You promised the next trip would fix it all. And I believed you for years, let you control me. Although I could not see anything, hear anyone or do anything, the promise of you is what kept me alive in that darkness. I was ecstatic every time you pulled me out of there. You responded in a way no one else could. You comforted me. I simply could not get enough.

 But the rude awakening of how empty you have left me  has me furious at you and ready to climb out by my own means. I'm building myself a ladder. A step forms every time I say no to you. I'm starting to see more light. I'm starting to rebuild and recollect the pieces of me you selfishly took and carelessly scattered everywhere.

 I know it hurts you that I'm leaving, believe me, it hurts me too. So much that I almost want to wither away in this hole and forget this ladder idea. But that speck of light coming in from above this hole reminds me of the beauty of the real world. The beauty I have been deprived of for too long. Because you kept me to yourself. This beauty is what will keep me going, keep me climbing even when you try to kick me back down. I will get back up. I will never give up. So you might as well leave for good. I know I needed you before but I don't need you any longer, I am ready to live again."
"I did it my friends, one month today And I can't explain what a huge change I have seen in myself. Now I see everything. Everything seems to connect now, why it was hard, why it was important to quit, everything. I'm never going back to weed. I'm genuinely scared of the power this seemingly harmless looking substance has on me.

&#x200B;

All of us here understand the rationale behind weed. It makes dealing with problems easier. But the problems don't go away. It's one thing to rationalize these things. But it's completely different to actually experience them. Like if I told you there is no self you understand it intellectually, but if you meditated for thousands of hours, you will see that experientially also.  That's when the point gets driven home. And  after one month, I see the point driven deep into my soul now.

&#x200B;

The most heartbreaking thing that happened to me was when I was talking to my ex yesterday and she told me ""If you had been a little more stable, I would have definitely married you"". She married someone else, and I'm honestly happy for her, but I know what she means when she says ""Being more stable"". In the morning I will get up with all the problems in my life staring right at me. And I'll say ""Today I'm gonna do something about it"" but in the evening I'll hit a blunt and then my thoughts will be like ""Problems? What problems?"". And this kept happening for three years. I would be sober in the morning, feel the load of ""I need to do something about my relationship, my job, my health"" and then smoke weed in the evening and forget all about them. Well too bad, time flew past and now my ex is married to someone else. But I learnt my lesson. I learnt it the hard way but at least I learned it! At one point of my life, it looked like I will never learn.

&#x200B;

Would you believe it, for years on a stretch, everyday I wanted to quit weed and everyday I smoked weed. Every goddamn day.

&#x200B;

Now I wake up in the morning and I do something about those problems. I talk to people, I go out. I have matured in my understanding of the world. I'm a very avid reader of Philosophy and for the first time in my life, everything I have read seems to make sense. As if I understand my life now.  I read and I write and I make music and I work and I'm calm the whole day. I had so much potential that I killed by just smoking weed guys. People far less qualified than me got promoted, and I stayed in the same place. And to be honest I don't even care about all of that. A prisoner has no time to think about the time lost in prison once he gets out. He's just happy that he's free. I just feel so different from what I was that I feel like I'm a different person. I got to keep all the good parts about me and made them better and I let go of all the bad parts. What else does it mean to live ""authentically""?

And thank you to all of you, I remember one month ago I made a post here saying I would never be able to quit weed. I'll always be a slave and I just can't do it. Some kind stranger recommended that I install ""I am sober"" app. I did and it was an extremely difficult journey but I did it. I somehow made it, I don't even know how but I did it. I cried multiple times. Multiple times I felt that life is pointless. Multiple times I felt not only bored but actually dysphoric, I flirted with the idea of ending my life, I couldn't sleep multiple times. I cried multiple times. I had many difficult moments in this one month but I somehow dealt with all of them in every other way except by going back to marijuana. I don't know where the motivation was coming from but I just couldn't go back to weed. Anything but that. I choose problems in life, I choose pain over the illusion of no problems and no pain.

&#x200B;

Never again mate. Trust me. Life not only gets easier, it gets better without marijuana. There are plenty of people in this world who can regulate marijuana use. But I'm not one of those people. I'm someone else. I have other ways to be happy. Barring the extreme cases where you need it for some disorder or something, nobody's life depends on any mood altering substance. I felt like I have depression and anxiety and I have bipolar but all I had was an extremely unhealthy relationship with marijuana.

&#x200B;

All of these posts about marijuana are true. It might not look it but they are. I see it now after a month. Quitting is not the hard part. The hardest part is to start. And to start every time you fall. That's the hard part. I know it sounds patronizing but seriously this is my entire life we're talking about. Anything I say about life will sound patronizing. But just trust me on this one."

"What shamans say about cannabis... Shamans say cannabis is a jealous plant, that it wants ALL of you, and doesn't want to share you with anyone else. So it fills your thoughts with itself, and causes you to love it more than anything else. My friend told me this recently (his sister is a shaman and he's spent time in the community) and it really resonated with me! I feel its grips loosening on me, though. My mind is no longer filled with thoughts of smoking, and it feels so good!!! Just thought I'd share the perspective."
"After 4 years of twice a day, drowning everything out with Jane, I’ve made it 2 weeks. And I have you all and your stories to help me through it. I just want to say that I think I’ve somehow made it. The urge to smoke just suddenly died inside me. One day after having yet another mini panic attack after smoking, I just decided I couldn’t do it anymore, I needed to find out what it would be like to not be a slave to drug that I never thought I could be trapped by. And it’s one of the most freeing things I’ve ever done. Thanks to every story I’ve ever read on this sub, from those who successfully made it months and years, to those who only staved off for a few days. I connected to the emotions and thoughts y’all were having and I think it helped me understand just how badly I had been trapped under a cloud of my delusions. So thank you, and I hope to see you all with clear eyes and clear heads."
"The Stoner: Cool, Calm, Indifferent, (and falling apart inside) Like many other leaves, my use of trees gradually grew out of control, so I don't mean to suggest that the phenomenon that I describe in this post applies to all, or even most, people who choose to smoke. However, it does reflect my personal experience with trees, and the experience of several close friends of mine.

Fast forward through those exciting initial days of experimentation and occasional use, past the days of only smoking on weekends, and stop when you get to the point where you're smoking every day. You get done with work/school, and toking up is the first thing you want to do. The fire hits the trees, and all of a sudden life is easy and carefree.

But its not. All of the things that were stressing you out before you decided to alter your state of mind are still there. Waiting for you. Waiting for you to not be stoned so that you remember that you need to take care of them. 

Your friends are there too. And your family members. And they would be happy to talk with you and to help you confront the challenges that you are facing in life. But instead, you decide to do drugs. You decide to run away from your problems and from the people in your life who care, and you smoke instead. 

Your mornings are different now. You don't wake up excited for the opportunities of a new day. You wake up in a haze, crabby, and stressed about all of the things that you didn't take care of the night before because you got high instead. You go to work or class, you get through the day because you're thinking about smoking as soon as you can. And as soon as you can, you smoke.

Your problems are still there. But you smoke again. You don't care, no worries, its all good. Your stoner friends call you up and ask if you want to smoke. ""Why not?"" So you smoke some more. Pretty soon your stoner friends are the only friends who are calling you up. Those other friends, who wanted to be a part of your life, recognize by now that you've changed. Maybe they know that you're getting high all the time. Maybe they don't. But you're distant regardless.

You keep coasting through life. You don't really pick up new habits or interests, but you don't care. You're cool with the crew that you roll with. Your smoking buddies. Meet someone who seems cool but doesn't smoke? Too bad, they could have been a cool friend if they were down for the cause. But who cares, you light another one up.

Maybe one day someone says something to you that makes you question the path you're on. They call you a pothead or something. Maybe you get in trouble with the law. Maybe you just start to question whether you want to be the kind of person who does drugs every day. 

You start to realize that everything isn't so cool. You realize that those problems that you've been smoking away are a lot bigger problems now because you've ignored them for days/weeks/years. You realize that the only friends that you have left are the people that you get high with, and when you don't want to get high anymore, you realize that those people aren't really your friends anymore either. They are just other people who like to get high. 

You stop smoking for a couple days. You hit up your old (non-smoking) friends, but you realize that they've moved on with their lives while you were getting high. You realize that you smoked away months/years of your life, and that while you were gone, people filled the space that you used to fill in their lives. 

A lot of us here, me included, react to these troubling realities of marijuana abuse in the worst way possible: by getting high again to escape the pain. But this takes you back to where you were. Back to Day Zero. Back to the temptation. 

Only by recognizing and constantly remembering the harm that trees have done to our lives can we remain strong in our commitment to give up our old ways and rebuild our lives, families, and friendships. Only by rebuilding healthy relationships that don't center around getting high can we ensure that we won't go back to our old toking ways. 

Think back to the person that you were before you used trees. Who were your friends? What inspired you? What were your dreams? Who did you want to become in the future?

When you were a little kid, did you want to grow up to be a person whose sole motivation to wake up in the morning was to get high? Did you strive to be the guy who always shows up with red eyes, smelling like weed? The guy who always forgets things? The friend who fell out of touch and mostly just stays home and gets high alone now? The guy who had a lot of potential, but somehow, threw it all away to get high?

I know I didn't.

"I’ve been grounded for 7 years, made this user name today and this is my first post on reddit ever, but i wanted to share this with you Hello, i just found this sub today. I have been on Reddit for over a decade and yet have never had the urge to go through creating a user name and password and  actually posting anything. That was, until i found this sub. I’m on mobile so.. shit format I’m sorry.. 

I used to smoke every day when i was in college. I was your decently sheltered Christian kid that left the nest to become and engineer. Fast forward 2 years , I dropped two classes and failed two more because i was so fucking high  all the time, i didn’t have time for finals or hw. It was so bad i changed majors to poli sci just so i could stop taking “ hard math classes”. 

I got into my Roomate’s food, i would steal anything i found in the fridge while i was stoned because... well because food was just so good. I would start pasta and leave it on the stove, too stoned to remember it was on , only to find the house filled with smoke as my Roomate’s yelled “AGAIN”?!

I was fortunate... i began having slight panic attacks when i smoked that would leave me with a terrifying feeling of existential agony. I say i was fortunate only because it was an excuse to start cutting back. I started dating my best friend and got her to smoke as well. She never smoked and she ended up having a seizure(underlying medical condition we didn’t know about). That plus my panic attacks sent me into a very dark place..

I married that wonderful woman and she helped me get rid of pot from my life. I’ve had two kids since and one on the way. I’m fortunate because my career and family make it near impossible to smoke. But the reason i wanted to post here wasn’t because i wanted to vent.. or talk about my “victory over pot”.

I don’t consider it a victory because there doesn’t go a goddamn day that i don’t think about pot. For the past seven years I’ve wanted to smoke and have had to remind myself of why i don’t. I actually have dreams where I smoke and get baked. That’s all my dreams are sometimes, me sitting in a room ripping a bong  getting high and actually feeling stoned in the dream

Thank you for creating this sub. And i apologize for the wall of text.. i didn’t realize i had all that to share. It hasn’t been easy not smoking,  but  I know my life has been so much better than it ever could have been had i not given it up. If anyone wants to talk please pm me, I’d be glad to share my experience..

Stay low friends"
Quit yesterday and I already almost texted my dealer and smoked old nugs I found on the floor. So disappointed in myself. But if people smoke their whole lives and quit I can too. I can too. I can too. Just needed to get this off my chest. Please send good vibes this way and good luck to all of you out there. This addiction shit is real.
"My experience regarding creativity after quitting weed (3 Months sober) I've seen people ask this question several times, but it was always too early for me to answer it.

Now I feel like I can tell you something about my experience! I write a lot of poems, I write songs and I make beats. I will focus on the writing aspect in general, as it is the thing that I'm most passionate about. 

&#x200B;

I've been writing (a lot) for about 4 years now. During that time I started smoking a lot, until it became a problem and I quit. Now to preface this, I have never written anything good while I was high. I would always write something down and think ""Wow this is amazing!"" only to wake up the next morning and think ""this is bullshit, youre dumb/ stoned"" and delete it again.

I mainly wrote inbetween being high, so at work, on break, commute, before smoking, whatever. I would always have these sudden bursts of inspiration and had to stop dead in my tracks and write everything down. It felt like I didnt have control over it, not necessarily in a bad way, but thats just how I was used to it.

&#x200B;

I wrote a poem on the day I knew I had to quit and after that I wasnt able to write anything for over a month.

An entire month without writing! My day to day anxiety got waaaaay better, but I was stressed the fuck out over not being able to write anymore.

After a little over a month I suddenly had a very short writing session where, for the first time, I kinda had to write something. A couple weeks passed and I started to write a little bit more. 

&#x200B;

After two months of sobriety I wrote a really long and great song that I would not have been able to write had I not quit!

Even recording and yelling was fun sober! I almost cried recording it and I remember feeling the endorphins rushing my body lmao

&#x200B;

After being quite satisfied with my work I also felt reassured and was sure that I soon would be writing even more.

And now! May comes around! Holy heck! 

&#x200B;

I've been writing more these last 8 days than I have been in the last 6 months of smoking! 

And its not just a lot, the quality of my writing, rhymes and associations (association for me is almost completely the same thing as inspiration) have greatly improved! My brain is definitely healing and it shows. 

I also gained the ability to just sit down and write when I want to! I literally wasnt able to do that! Now I can just sit down, say ""I wanna write"" and do that with great results! It doesnt feel rushed, forced or out of my control. Now it feels like I own my brain and the clarity of my mind is really paying of. 

&#x200B;

Being sober is worth it! Many times I was anxious that I lost my ability to write, but it was never the case. Getting sober was the most severe case of that specific anxiety I have encountered so far, but god damn! Its better than ever, your head being free and fast WILL (in long term!) improve your creative abilities. 

&#x200B;

Stick with it, it will be worth it! <3 

&#x200B;

I hope I was able to reassure some restless minds, I love you all <3 You can PM me if you want to talk"

EDIT 2: Gold giving stranger, you rock. My heart is warm that you saw this as encouraging. Don't let those scary dreams stop you. They ain't got nothin' on your badass."
Turned down a blunt today. Couple months in and I'm totally disgusted at the thought of personal use. I feel good. L
"15 years old, been a daily smoker for over 2 years and am 3 weeks clean!!!!! Honestly the benefits have been microscopic at best, but I’m still pretty siked! I’m doing homework again at home, I’m finally making friends and talking to girls, something I never did when I was high all the time.  I can think with so much more clarity and I’m signing up for sports like football and track.  My sleep is still hell though, getting up 4 times a night and waiting 2 hours just to fall asleep, but I can deal with that for now.  I just wanted to thank this community!  I would not have been able to do this without you guys and the support has been unbelievable.

EDIT: Wow some of these comments are seriously awesome! I’m glad I could be an inspiration to some, but I think it’s the people with 5+ year habits who really inspire me.  These last few weeks have easily been some of the hardest of my life, but I can’t even begin to imagine what some of you veterans are going through.  Thanks a lot for the kind comments, it REALLY means a lot!"
"Day 2! Made it through the first sleepless night, with many more ahead. Am damn proud, as I've smoked daily for around 20 years and I have a coffeeshop across the street. But it's quittin' time now. I read many of your posts, and it really helps knowing what's ahead. Thank you!! "
