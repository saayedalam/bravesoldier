some notes and encouragement on meditation from someone who has meditated for nearly 20 years. so ive seen some people expressing frustration with mediation here on rleaves in the words of utommybahami123 its kind of tough in the sense that i get distracted while attempting to clear my mind or everything. and from ujonny070389 ive just given up on the meditation my mind just goes off on crazy tangents. so as someone who has meditated for many years and credits meditation with making my life an easier place to live i thought id pass along my thinking on it. thanks to the leavers above for the inspiration to write this. to me saying ive given up on meditation because my mind goes off on crazy tangents is like saying ive given up on working out because my heart rate goes up and i start breathing hard. your mind going off on crazy tangents is exactly what you meditate to experience and beginning to learn how to guide those tangents back to peace is exactly what youre there to learn. everybodys mind goes off on crazy tangents. thats why mediation is something you have to learn how to do and why learning how to do it can take a long time. my first suggestion is that you begin meditation with an attitude that its something you are going to experience not something you are going to do. saying that its something you are going to do makes it a job or a chore or a skill you feel you have to develop and thats more than a little ambitious when youre just starting out. my suggestion is that you sit quietly in a comfortable position in a darkish but not pitch black room and set a timer for ten minutes. tell yourself that voice in my head is always yammering away at me for the next ten minutes im going to listen to it. then just sit quietly and listen to it. try not to guide it try not to make mental notes on what its saying try not to tell yourself youll have to remember that for later just sit quietly and listen. then when the alarm goes off go on with your day. if you can try not to process what you heard do not think wow i really obsessed about work just let that ten minute session go and move on with your day. do that for a week. in your second week you get to actively choose somthing to help yourself. set your timer and choose something simple and repetitive to concentrate on. some people focus on their breathing the actual sensation of air moving through their nose or throat. other people count slowly and quietly to three or five in their head. choose what makes sense for you. it should be peaceful and repetitive. then in your ten minutes let your thoughts rest on that repetitive idea. inhale exhale inhale exhale or onetwothreeonetwothree whatever you chose. you will nearly immediately lose control of that and your chatty thoughts will intrude. when that happens simply think quietly those were other thoughts i want to go back to my peaceful repetition. and return to whatever you chose. this losing of focus will happen ten or a hundred times during your session. quietly guiding yourself back to your repetitive place is what you are there to teach yourself. do not get frustrated on how many times it happens just note it remark to yourself that it happened and return you your peaceful repetition. this is the only task and only work of meditation. noting when your thoughts have strayed and returning yourself to peaceful repetition. i have been meditating for nearly 20 years now and as you practice your inner thoughts intrude fewer and fewer times and when they do you are very experienced at returning to a place of peace. and as you might suspect the skills ive learned in meditating begin to extend outside of my meditation session. ive learned how to be much more aware of my inner dialog and im much more capable of noting what it is saying separating myself from it and keeping it from taking automatic influence over my thoughts and actions. i hope this made sense. feel free to ama if something was not clear.,joy

i quit thc cold turkey for 6 months my thoughts weed isnt addictive i can quit whenever i want. a weed addict who doesnt understand how addiction works. youll never want to quit. weed ai not never hurt nobody ive held down a full time job at walmart for the past 5 years and im paying my bills how can you say weed is slowing me down a person who is completely content with where they are in life and lacks any motivation or drive needed to move forward with any endeavors. every person at some point in their life will come to the realization that there is no growth in comfort. how old you are when you reach that point is completely up to you. the thing stoners dont understand is weed possesses absolutely zero short term flaws. the damage it does to your life happens slowly over time and youll be too high to notice it. it doesnt ruin your reality the real danger is how it makes you extremely comfortable in your current reality. thats why alot of people up here reflect on how they stayed in the same place in life for years because of this habit. weed is a coping method. you had a bad day hit a blunt youll feel better. long day at work at a job you hate hit a blunt youll forget all about it. youre sober now time to go back to work at the job you hate take a pen with you you can be high all day and the day will float right by. when you are sober you have a fire within you that burns for better at all times. when you are high youre numb youre content. when youre sober at that job you hate you have the drive to strive for better. you have the drive to push for more out of life. when you are a stoner the only drive youll have is to make more money so that you can freely dive into the weed habit of your dreams. i stayed in the same mediocre spot for 4 years because of how content i was. one time i got a good job and the hours prevented me from smoking and chilling like i wanted to so therefore i was constantly calling in sick so i could have that time to smoke and chill. this is why many successful people say weed is a luxury for those who have already made it to where they want to be in life. now i understand why its a drug that can keep you stagnant. if you want to quit my advice is to ask yourself how bad do you want more more out of life. more from yourself. this drug doesnt serve you and it never will. right now you are a slave to your mind and your mind is a slave to this habit that makes you mentally weak. are you content with this no then keep reading. all you have to do is have the balls to acknowledge that you have a problem and simply take back control. have the balls to take back control of your mind. have the balls to take back control of your body. have the balls to take back control of your time. have the balls to take back control of your life. no one can do this for you only you can. realize shit like this is supposed to be tough if this was a perfect world everyone would be free. but despite whatever cozy comfort bubble your weed habit has put you in the world is not perfect and this is not going to be easy. personal battles like this are what separates the mediocre from the great. just ask yourself do you want to stay who you are for the next 5 years or do you want to strive for greatness you decide.,joy
i used the money normally wasted on weed to adopt a puppy and buy her toys supplies and shots. im so happy i quit. look at her little face nothing but good things have come out of leaving.,joy
my weed smoking buddy wanted to meet tonight and talk about life one of my best friends who ive been smoking with on a near weekly basis for 8 9 years hit me up tonight to discuss recent drama in his life. 99 of the time we meet we smoke. sometimes he brings sometimes i bring. but we almost always smoke. its what began our friendship. he told me he has new rolling papers for me. the transparent ones that i like. i told him i stopped smoking 2 weeks ago in an effort to better myself but do not mind he smokes. a second later he texts me saying he totally understands. we met. he smoked. he did not offer. i didnt ask for a puff. i am still 2 weeks sober. it was fine. we are still friends. even better friends than before,joy
finally able to afford a puppy now that im not spending all my money on weed this is ozzie and i love him,joy
46 days clean and i shot my bong to celebrate never going back,joy
day 32 just wanted to share something that happened tonight what my life looked like for the past 5 years rush home after work to get high. crash. get high. crash. get high. crash. get high. fall asleep. avoid my dad with dementia because its too painful. get high as soon as i crash so i do not cry about avoiding my ailing dad while he sits alone and confused. what my life looked like tonight call my dad soon as i get off work. pick him up and take him to get frozen yogurt. help him navigate the place. crack jokes get laughs. pay for his frozen yogurt while he holds it excitedly like a little kid about to get a special treat. drive him home sit with him and eat together watching his favorite tv show. did not have to rush to get high did not have to emotionally avoid. so much more time so much more emotional capacity and clarity. dont get me wrong sobriety is hard like all the time but worth it.,sadness
quit any bad habit instantly without willpower quit any bad habit instantly without willpower 📷 quitting bad habits is easy youve just been using the wrong method normally people quit a habit using willpower but willpower is a limited resource. when we rely on willpower we encounter ego depletion we lose all motivation to keep fighting and give in to our raging craving. for example when you first quit you can do well for a few days then you start to think maybe just this one time or ive been good i can just do it a little. and you give in. but do not worry there is another way using this strange method i have quit alcohol sugar binge eating smoking porn and procrastination. as a result i have lost 70 pounds found a girlfriend quit all medication and i wake up with a smile on my face. here is the method 1. meet your addiction voice av you bad habit or addiction has its own voice the av. the av wants you to give in to your cravings and works by hijacking your inner monologue. it will say things in your own voice like why do not you just smoke one more time it wo not do any harm or you need to smoke or you will get grumpy and damage your relationships. the truth is everything the av says is a lie to get you to give in to your bad habit. 2 learn to recognise your av your av can be brought to light by making the law. the law is unbreakable and does not require any willpower to follow. does it require willpower for you not to steal a car or rob a bank no the law cannot be broken at any point. write down your law if it helps but the most important part is defining it. e.g. i will never smoke again. but how can this help you recognise your av because any thought that pops in your head that contradicts the law is the av not you. 3 create an av avatar assign an avatar to your av. for example my smoking av was an old ugly man who chain smoked and had cancer. whenever id hear him say go on just have a quick one it ca not hurt id say screw you old man and give him the finger. this also helps with cravings. cravings are not really happening to you they are happening to your av avatar. your av avatar wants to give in not you without you giving in they will disappear and die your true self is already free of this addiction so the cravings are not happening to you they are happening to your av. extra tips never negotiate. if you keep playing with your av and trying to argue you will just end up giving in. as soon as your recognise your av shut it down. make your avatar ugly not friendly. they are the scum of the earth. my binge avatar was a pig not a cute little one a fat smelly warty one. always remember your av cannot make you do anything. all it can do is speak to you you do not have to do what it says your cravings and voice will disappear faster than you realise but never let your guard down. now go out there and kick your avs ass and say goodbye to your bad habit,anger
my wife threw it all out it was the end of the day. we had just put the kiddo to bed. typically this is when we would head outside to light up but i was 5 days into sobriety so she was doing that alone. these early days have been tough because i know i could just go with her. my plan was to turn on the baseball game and dive into some code for a side project. went to turn on the game and it was blacked out. i became unreasonably angry at this. i felt helpless like i could not even distract myself from my cravings. when my wife came back inside i was ranting angrily about it. none of this anger was directed at her but my aura was not fun at that moment. i went down to feed our pets angrily grumbling to them. came back upstairs and i saw my wife going back outside. at first i thought i fucked up and needed to go out and apologize for being overly mad about something as stupid as a baseball game. i could not be more wrong. she came inside with what was left of our stash. went straight to the bathroom and dumped it all in the toilet. were doing this together she said. i hugged her and cried into her shoulder. i know this decision is hard and i did not want to make her give up her vice just because i had chosen to. i was so overwhelmed with love at that moment. she prioritized me and that meant so much. day 6 today for me. day 1 for her. i feel so much stronger and confident with her at my side through this.,anger
weed makes it ok weed makes it ok for you to go to bed without brushing your teeth. weed makes it ok for you to pig out on junk food and not clean up the mess. weed makes it ok for you to spend money you should be saving. weed makes it ok for you to live a passionless life. weed makes it ok for you to live in isolation. weed makes it ok for you to not clean your room. weed makes it ok for you to forget your goals. weed makes it ok for you to turn your head away from the real source of pain. weed makes you think youre ok. chronic use of weed made these and many other detrimental behaviors seem ok. there was no problem so long i had some flower to smoke. you have a choice and even though it might seem scary even though you might think how am i going to live without weed once you make a choice for yourself a choice to be happy again you will thank yourself later. dont give up its much brighter on this side i promise. remember its not weeds fault but rather your own choices. edit wow. thank you so much for all your support everyone. it makes me very happy to know that this helps many of you out there. keep on believing in yourselves you are not alone. ❤️ also please remember this is from my personal experience everyone is different. ❤️❤️ much love and stay happy.,joy
this used to be my smoke spot. now its my banana spot.,anger
you should break up with weed if you love it so much that its all that you think of right after waking up. you have been getting high each and every day of your life for many months or for many years. your whole life is centred around getting high. you first get high even to do your mundane tasks. your life has narrowed down to enjoying only when you are smoked up. you are always thinking about your next dose even after getting high. you have tried moderation but very soon you are back to your old self. you become irritable bad tempered and fearful when you are going to run out of your stock. your closest buddies are the ones who indulge in weed or other substances. you only go out if there is weed involved. you go to work but in the background you are always looking for your evening or night with mary jane. or you go to work after getting high. or you manage to get high even in the middle of your work. you clearly have come to the realization that weed is affecting all the possible domains of your life. physical mental financial spiritual relationship with the loved ones the opposite sex social skills work and career hobbies passions personality or character you have a feeling that you are living far below your true potential and calibre. trust me if you feel that its quite the truth your every day is kind of the same like riding in a ferris wheel. you tend to think about sober life and all the better things you could be doing after getting high. you have become tired of that specific fleeting only partially satisfying very familiar type of high that only downregulates with time. you mostly pass out in your bed after getting high and exhausted. edit thank you uhsquared9319 for the gold. thank you to uhpa511 for one more additional point. thank you to this brilliant community for allowing me to break free as i am 21 days sober today. some more content on the way for all you amazing souls,anger

thanks to rtrees and rall we have a bunch of new members hello if youre new here have a look below at what were about. if youve been here awhile please make a special effort to find posts without comments and give your thoughts so people know theyre welcome hi im subduction the founder and a moderator of rleaves. first and foremost its great to have you here and im glad you decided to come to see what were about. since how we act towards each other is the only thing that makes this place as special as it is i just wanted to take an opportunity for some reminders for newcomers and old timers alike. who we are this is a subreddit for people who have made the decision to quit cannabis edibles or other thc products. the only people were not suited for are people who have the intention to continue smoking or return to smoking. that includes moderation management tolerance breaks i just need to get away from it for a while or i need help getting through the next few months while my dealers on vacation. its hard for people trying to quit for good to have discussions with people who are still smoking or intending to start again so we keep our focus pretty narrow. who we are not the thing that sets rleaves apart from most of the other subreddits is that people come here at what is often the worst time in their lives. they feel bad and have little love for the world or anyone in it. so one of the few rules we very firmly enforce is that we are a support community. we are here to help each other creating an accepting community and a welcome place to be. i know the rest of reddit can be rough and tumble but that ends at the rleaves front door. even if you disagree with someone if you are rude dismissive or any other flavor of impatient we will moderate your posts or comments out and if you make a habit of it we will ban you. if you cannot find a supportive way to communicate with people find a way to disagree with them in a respectful way or guide people with what you think are wrong ideas in a gentle and understanding way then you should not comment. dealing with problems if someone is trolling seems to have missed the point of the group is soapboxing in a way contrary to our mission or anything else that might tick you off do not comment and use the report button. that brings it to the mods attention where we can review it. use the report button early and often its really a help. again however please do not comment. that just gives trolls more opportunities to keep trolling. to keep modding from being too crazy we use automod keyword filters that automatically holds posts relating to some topics for review by the mods. we review every single automodded post but sometimes we can mess up so if you are not seeing your post and think its somehow stuck feel free to message the mods. how rleaves works best the point of rleaves is many helping one and one helping many. i know its tempting to be a lurker but unless we share our experience then no one has any lessons to learn. please post often and comment often. just the process of writing out your posts helps you and posting them helps others. we now get over 145000 unique users a month here at rleaves so even a small participation can help a whole lot of people. thanks very much for arriving here and we look forward to seeing your progress posts and great stories ahead subduction the mod team,sadness
my wife told me last night that all she wants for her birthday this year is a sober husband my wife of 18 years told me last night with tears in her beautiful eyes that all she wants for her birthday this year is a sober husband. it was an ultimatum . . . a line in the sand of sorts. this rattled me to my core and was just the impetus i needed to finally break this chain of addiction once and for all. im 41 years old and ive been smoking weed off and on mostly on since i was 15. i quit drinking and smoking cigarettes many years ago. marijuana however has proven to be my toughest chemical crutch to hang up for good. ive been trying to quit for 11 years now. ive quit for over a year on three separate occasions only to be lured back by this most seductive drug. even though my parents encouraged me to drink and smoke from a very young age i take full responsibility for my actions at this point in my life. enough is enough. im determined to give my wife a completely sober present husband. im determined to give my kids a completely sober present dad — which is something i never had as a child. the cycle of addiction ends with me. im doing this for them yes but first and foremost at the end of the day im doing this for myself. im a healthy person. i dont smoke weed anymore. this is my new mantra. i chant it silently while i meditate. i chant it while doing yoga. i chant it on my daily early morning runs. i chant it before and during any activity that i used to associate with smoking weed. and in doing so im truly beginning to believe it. im determined more than ever before to finally nip this thing in the bud for good. pun intended this wonderful community of supportive folks has been absolutely invaluable to me. so glad to be a leaver instead of a stoner. day 11 big love friends. ❤️ edit i am overwhelmed and humbled by the outpouring of wisdom encouragement and support from complete strangers on this sub. i have tears in my eyes as i write this because i am so deeply moved by all this genuine kindness. thank all of you so very much based on some tips ive received here im changing my mantra to simply im a happy healthy sober person. it makes sense that psychologically speaking saying i dont smoke weed anymore can have a negative connotation to it since it emphasizes something lost rather than something gained. im set to gain and keep soooooo much by sticking firmly to a path of sobriety and thats exactly what i intend to dowhat i will do also today i stopped by both of my stoner friends houses individually and made it very clear to them that i do not smoke weed anymore. i was completely honest with them about why without being judgmental in any way towards their choice for continuing. this was a very big deal for me and something ive never been able to do before in the past. its a game changer. they were both extremely supportive of and encouraging to me. one of them my longtime best friend to my great surprise even opened up to me and showed interest in also wanting to quit for some of the same reasons i mentioned. we plan on starting some healthy activities together from now on instead of just sitting around toking together as we have for years. im very proud of myself for the first time in awhile and so is my wife. i came home from that and playfully flexed my arms and with a big smile said to my wife im stronger than a plant babe 😂 again thank you all so very much i will check in here regularly. 😊🙏 a happy healthy sober person,joy
sober since 119. heres why.,sadness
for the past month i have been meditating daily working out stretching on a yoga mat for 20 minutes a night drinking tea instead of coffee and getting 8.5 hours of sleep per night and i feel like i have superpowers i have to admit i feel kind of fucking ridiculous as i type this. its amazing what dropping my bad habits and replacing them with good habits has done for me. i used to smoke myself to sleep each night with high thc dabs and i would wake up feeling like a train had hit me in the head. i had to have a fucking bang every morning just to get out of bed and i only ate when i was stoned and it was always greasy fast food. fuck that noise i am never going back. i love this new lifestyle and i love feeling like a champion every day. no morning brain fog at all i even wake up early. im even picking up old hobbies i stopped doing like reading and training my dog to learn new tricks. the biggest realization ive had is life does not always have to be so fucking hard. if you take care of yourself it makes every other problem in life so much more manageable i feel so much less stressed all the time and i have a much bigger attention span at work. its like hitting the easy mode button on life. i love it i love it i love it i love it.,joy
i want to quit when im high but i want get high when im sober was so true for me because thats how everything was when i was high. big life plans things to learn incredible inventions screenplay ideas that all evaporated when the high wore off. weed is the ultimate empty yes man. weed sat next to me for years saying wow thats an awesome idea dude write that down now take another puff and well start tomorrow for sure. tomorrow never came until i quit.,joy
my chess rating since i stopped smoking. its nice to see a clear indication that my cognitive functions are returning.,joy
600 days clean the best thing about marijuana is also the worst thing about marijuana i smoked every day almost constantly for about 7 years. i could recite every canned talking point about the safety of the substance how you cant get addicted to it all the negative effects that come from prohibition and anything else you can imagine. one of my favorite facts is that there has never been one death from blood toxicity of cannabinoids. other than stupid choices one makes while under the influence you cannot effectively kill yourself by smoking too much weed. trust me ive tried. i still consider this to be one of the best attributes of the drug. its relatively safe in this respect. however this fact also has a very dark side to it. you can smoke weed all day every day and still survive. if i had consumed any other substance with the frequency and quantity that i smoked weed id be fucking dead. full stop. i would be viewed as an addict i would have profound health problems and would be generally a degenerate by any reasonable persons standard. but because i smoked weed i wasnt an addict you cant get addicted to it i was a stoner. a nonconformist. i lived my life how i saw fit otherwise i would just be a square. i could smoke relentlessly and have no incredibly negative consequences. and im the sort of person that needs consequences. i thought that because i didnt flunk out of school get arrested or have any sort of major health problems that i was keeping it together. i was surviving. but i wasnt truly living. friends of mine graduated and began to do big things. start business go to graduate school write books get jobs and wives. i sat around watching the office or its always sunny for the fifth time. i never held a good job just enough to pay for my weed. i lived at home with my parents. in short i stagnated. i never matured i never developed positive coping skills nor learned how to try fail and try again. i watched friends and schoolmates build lives and realize their potential. i didnt truly realize this for years. if i had had obvious consequences i would have had to face them. but i fell pray to weeds subtle seduction and faced its cruelest trick. it doesnt kill you but it still takes your life. dont get me wrong its definitely preferable to be alive than to die by an overdose. but its sadder in its own way to live in stagnation than to truly live. it is the life unlived.,sadness
if cannabis was a girl i wrote this for myself after getting pretty much 0 sleep the first night. it just hit me that my entire relationship with weed seriously resembled a relationship i had with an extremely needy girl. so here if cannabis was a girl when you first met her you could not believe how great she was. she made you forget your problems food tasted better sex was amazing and even if you were a lifelong insomniac with her you could relax and sleep for 10 hours. wow. unlike your ex miss alcohol she also just left in the morning. she gave you one more kiss of happiness and said see you at the next party. next few weekends were the same. she just kept on giving without asking for anything in return. you liked her so much that seeing her just once per week was not enough anymore. you decided to start seeing her every night. she remained more or less the same but you changed. you feel in love with her so much that you stopped doing your evening activities just to be with her. you dropped an odd friend or two and stopped your healthy diet so you two could enjoy the junk food she likes so much. after few months you started thinking that life without her just would not be the same so you decided to let her move in with you and spend entire days together. now she started showing her true colors. she told you to drop more of your friends and family to make time for her and without even thinking you did. she told you that you are not allowed to eat food fuck or sleep unless she is there. you started seeing that this is no longer free spirited non needy girl you thought she was. you tried to take a break for a week just to realize how deep she got her hooks in you. she was right you could not sleep eat or even enjoy a movie without her. but now you know her for what she really is. you also realize that it was not just her fault. you are a needy person that wanted her to be with you 247. you thought she was a solution to all your problems she wasnt. she just made you forget about them. now you have to deal with 20 things at once. good news even just 24h after the last contact with her you start quickly forgetting about her. sure happy memories come back and tempt you every now and then but now you know better. while things are bad you know that in a week they will be much better and whats a week compared to a lifetime of wired co dependent suffering with her nothing. i am happy to pay my price and move on. i am looking forward to another sleepless night these will serve as reminders to stay away for a long time to come. stay strong brothers and sisters we got this,love
after 8 days sobriety really being tested. this is how ive chosen to deal with things instead a sunset picnic for one 💚 stay strong out there friends.,joy

the key to quitting weed easily and permanently please hear me out and read till the end this was an absolute game changer for me. the key to quitting easily and permanently really comes down to a shift in how you look at things. if you see quitting pot as this big sacrifice then your always going to have cravings and have to fight these cravings. you need to get to a place where you see quitting pot as a major blessing see that your really not giving up or sacrificing anything but instead gaining so much. most importantly you need to stop focusing on why you should not smoke weed and start focusing on why you smoke weed in the first place and dispel these illusions. what is it that keeps you coming back what is it you think its giving to you most people say i should quit because my health will be better ill have better energy ill have more confidence ill be better socially ill excel more in my career ill be far more productive ill have better relationships with my family ill feel proud of who i am ill be more present in my daily activities ill feel more alive ill save more money and ill have more time to focus on the things that really matter. while all of this and more is true these things do not address why you are using weed in the first place. would not it be easy to quit weed if you had no cravings to begin with your brain only has limited willpower so if your constantly getting bombarded with cravings because you think your giving up something you value for any of these positive benefits then its a matter of time before you reach a weak moment and your cravings finally take you over and you go auto pilot. therefore the key is to go through every single reason why you use weed and dispel the illusion of these reasons im going to provide examples now of how this looked like for me. the reasons i used weed and the reasons these were false illusions 1. weed makes me more creative actually this is not true. weed disconnects me from my higher self. when im sober im alot more connected to the subconscious mind and find it easier to bring clarity to the ideas im getting from my deeper and more intelligent self. when im high im vibrating at a lower level cutting me off from higher intelligence and not giving me the energy to bring my ideas into fruition. i am far more creative when im in a happy and relaxed state and when im smoking weed because of the guilt i feel im not as happy and relaxed as i could be making my ideas and creative output lower in quality. even the good ideas i do come up with nothing ends up happening because im to stoned to take action on them. this leads to a sea of half baked no pun intended ideas that end up going no where. when im sober i have far more clarity and can hear music in my head in far more intricate detail and bring these ideas from my head and into materialization alot easier this is why the idea that it makes me more creative is entirely false and a complete illusion. 2. it makes me relaxedis a good way to relax actually this is not true. it is robbing my relaxation and peace from me. this is because i know deep in my heart that smoking weed is making me move further and further away from my goals and what i truly want in life. although it brings short term pleasure it brings absolutely no peace and relaxation to know that im throwing my life and potential away every day i spend high sitting around. infact i do not think peace is even possible for me when im caught up in the daily smoking of pot. not only that but every time i smoke im robbing my brain of the necessary chemicals needed to provide a natural and long term sense of peace and relaxation. i also find it impossible to eat healthy when im stoned leading me to eating tons of foods that only contribute to anxiety and depression. everyday that goes by that i waste i feel a nagging coming from my higher self telling me that this is not the way i want to live and that i want to quit. im not even dealing with the things i need to be dealing with on a daily basis and am letting things pile up more and more and become more out of control. because of this smoking weed actually causes a ton of stress in my life and makes life 10x harder then it has to be. the idea that it brings me relaxation is a complete and utter illusion and nonsense caused by short term spikes of dopamine and in the long run causes tons of stress and anxiety. 3. its enjoyablegives me pleasureis fun and enhances life actually this is not the case. it is actually robbing pleasure from me in every way i can imagine. first of all its spiking my dopamine levels high in my brain giving me short term artificial pleasure that plummets when i come down off the drug only needing more and more to feel any sort of pleasure or happiness. its leading me to miss out everyday on major opportunities that are going to bring me long term pleasure from the feeling of winning and success in life. every experience that im having in life while stoned is one that im not even fully present for or fully experiencing. i do not remember 80 of the stuff im even doing while im stoned. although it feels fun in the moment its something ill look back on in a years time and just see as blank empty space with no memory of the time i wasted and threw away. is this really pleasurable at all is it really pleasurable for me to keep on pushing back my goals and dreams and not feel satisfaction in myself to not trust myself to feel guilty everyday that i need a drug to feel any sort of joy or happiness of course not. its a complete illusion that weed creates any kind of joy or pleasure in my life its actually stripping me of amazing life experiences where im fully present and can feel the amazing joy that comes from feeling naturally alive healthy and accomplishing great things in life. it robs me of any true fulfillment and will only leave me with regret broken promises to myself wasted time and lost opportunities. so no this is not fun this is not enjoyable or pleasurable or any of the things that kept me using. these are all completely false. i could go on but im sure you get the idea you need to go through all the reasons personal to you and write out exactly why all those reasons that keep you using are false and a complete illusion. once you do these properly and see that you actually have so much to gain by quitting weed and nothing to lose you will no longer have cravings or at least much fewer then you would of had. youve now dispelled the illusions that made you think you were giving up something in your life of any real value. you can see through these cravings and know they are false. now is when you decide that your done with weed you will never take one toke ever again and that its something you will never touch again in your life. you must understand your an addict and even one toke will put you right back to where you started there is no moderation for us in this sub so do not fall for that nasty illusion. for people going through withdrawal be easy on yourself give yourself time give it a month before you even expect to feel any bit of positivity and do not get discouraged if your not feeling great right away. your brain receptors are going to take time sometimes alot of time depending on your abuse to rewire themselves and create your neurotransmitters normally again. ride it out. best wishes.,joy
a day in the life of an addict. i recently broke my 2 week sober streak by celebrating with a joint after i passed my licensing exam. heres a recap of my saturday to demonstrate how quickly things revved up in the 24 hours following relapse. im wasting my life away while im on weed and i mean that in the most literal sense. saturday1000 a.m wake up and purchase a quarter oz despite telling myself that yesterday was a mistake and that it was just a slip up. we were celebrating. also had to buy papers and a lighter cause i threw mine out the last time i said i was quitting. 1030 a.m had my first joint with a cup of coffee down by the lake. great start to a beautiful summer day. so far so good. 1100 a.m starting to feel hungry too lazy to make food. smoke another joint instead. 1230 p.m meet up with a friend that i had not seen in a few weeks because i was not smoking and we smoke 2 fattys together. 200 p.m holy shit i still have not eaten yet my stomach is killing me. i finally grab a burger from mcds cause im lazy remember 230 p.m whew. that was a good meal shall i smoke another one i think i will. 400 p.m at this point my room mate comes home they know im not supposed to be smoking so i purposely left the house to get high without them finding out. i shit you not for the next 2 hours i sat in my car by myself getting high. this is what i decided to do on a hot ass summer day. i think i browsed reddit and listened to a couple podcasts too so atleast i have that going for me. 630 p.m. room mate invites me out to a bbq. i politely decline because ive been smoking non stop since 10 in the morning and im not even sure im alive at this point. room mate is curious as to why im so low energy today i tell him im just burnt out its been a long week. instead i mindlessly played games on my phone for the next 3 hours. did i mention how fricken beautiful it is outside 930 p.m oh shit i have not eaten since 2 lets munch on some taco bell. but lets smoke one first. 1000 p.m and after. 1200 a.m open up my baggie to see that i only have a nug and some shake left at the bottom. at this point i realize that i smoked a quarter to myself almost in one day. im overcome by grief and regret and swear that after this one last joint im done. 1215 a.m got high for the last time 300 a.m browsing leaves and trying to muster up the strength and willpower to leave this shit behind for good. as embarrassing as it is days like this are not all that uncommon for me. i prioritize weed over everything whenever i go on these little benders. im out here lying to people starving myself sitting in my car doing fuck all for extended periods of time just so i can get high. i ca not keep living like this. day 0 again. fuck me.,sadness
great quote that helps me stay sober yesterday an old friend posted a picture on snapchat from one of the humans of ny books and the quote from the woman in the picture was so profound. i wish id partied a little less. people always say ‘be true to yourself. but thats misleading because there are two selves. theres your short term self and theres your long term self. and if youre only true to your short term self your long term self slowly decays. i immediately applied this to my quit journey. when i have cravings i try to remember that my short term self wants to get high. but my long term self made a decision to quit. this has been so helpful to me not only with weed sobriety but also with alcohol sobriety that journey started about five weeks before i quit pot. so when the cravings hit remember your long term self edit cant believe this post resonated with so many people thank you so much for the awards this sub has had such a positive impact on my life and i want to thank everyone who has posted here before that gave me the support and inspiration i needed. so happy to think ive been able to give some of that back to you all. stay strong everyone,joy
road to keeping clean building my confidence ive been using weed as a crutch for years now smoking on an off for 10 years now and im starting to be more and more aware of times when i need to blaze. i realize how insecure i get when i smoke and how much i want change in my life.,fear
i actually believed smoking weed was making me more enlightened and spiritual. what an idiot. reading books on history and philosophy while sober is much more effective.,joy
i drew a comic about why i quit smoking weed 22 days clean,joy
if you quit smoking today you can give yourself the gift of 6 months fog free on christmas morning.,joy
😞when im high i want to quit when im sober i want to smoke just needed to put it out there. thats where im at. ill be out of bud after today and i think its just best to hide all of it and work on me.,joy
im probably at least twice your age if not three times. and since i cant be a shining example let me at least share some hard won wisdom. every time ive relapsed ive ended up in the same place. stuck. trapped. lots of ideas very little action. disconnected. out of shape. unemployed. lonely. so much struggle every day. so much confusion forgetfulness exhaustion. the mess. the broken promises. the unreliability. the lost potential. my brain is damaged my vision is damaged cant see in the dark my lungs are damaged my retirement is nonexistent. this could be your future. i hope it isnt. ive been crying a lot lately about what i missed out on this life. but im gonna try again. ive been sober from alcohol for nine years quit smoking cigarettes a couple months ago. time to get clean again. very glad to have found yall i have my first 24 hours. 🙂,sadness
stopping smoking weed is gonna make your life infinitely better and is nowhere near as hard as your stoner mind will have you believe go for it i found reading the posts here to be helpful when quitting smoking. i figured id share my experience in the hope that it might help others in their mission to ditch weed for reference i smoked for 4.5 years. daily for the last 3 years. 55 days free as i write this. ill start with a chronology of what its like to quit so you know what you might experience and later on in the post ill write some more about how to get yourself psyched up for quitting and into that fuck this mindset heres how it went for me day 1 it feels a bit surreal. 8pm rolls round and your instinct is to seek out some weed and smoke. resist do something else ideally something that will tire you out physically. you might prob will have trouble sleeping tonight. but guess what youre solid and you arent gonna bitch out and cave are you no good. your body and mind are used to being in a chemical slumber when you fall asleep. tonight your mind is drug free and it feels like your thoughts are going 100mph dont worry it gets much easier. day 7 youve been having crazy dreams because your body is re adjusting to having proper healthy rem sleep. your mental and physical ability to regenerate and repair is already much better. youll feel much sharper mentally. because youve been smoking weed chronically you begin to realise how much its been holding you back and feel like youre the fucking guy off limitless working at 120 capacity hahaha week 3 up until this point youve been painfully aware of the fact that days feel like theyre 40 hours long. youre coming to the realisation that normal people aka non weed addicts actually do stuff like sit and watch tv on their own go to the gym and then go to bed. up until this point youve been looking at the calendar daily wondering why only 1 day is passing when each day feels like 3. at this stage you are realising with a crazy sense of wtaf how insane the concept of smoking weed every single day is in a cult of weed smokers. you realise how strange your defending of weed and weed smokers must have sounded to non stoners. week 4 at this stage you are elite non weed smoker and are basically out of the woods. you stop doing the weird calendar watching and stop caring about how long you havent smoked in. you have absolutely no desire to smoke weed anymore. you might find yourself around people smoking weed again at this stage but have the ability to say no. it feels great. week 7 you now realise that by not smoking weed you have lots of spare time. you are much more efficient and motivated to do small jobs and engage in productive activities such as working out and attending clubs etc. you also realise you are about £100 better off every single week which is the equivalent of getting a 5 grand pay rise at work tell me that isnt a good incentive eh heres the secret the difficult part of quitting is getting yourself to a place mentally where you are 100 ready to leave weed behind and move on with your life. the whole not smoking the weed bit is actually surprisingly easy for me the hardest part was psyching myself up for d day where i was gonna quit cold turkey. it seems like the scariest idea at the time but once you do it youll realise how little you actually had to worry about go for it once you are in the frame of mind where youre ready to leave it behind you are in the drivers seat and in total control of your weed smoking behaviours conversely short term ‘knee jerk attempts to quit are destined to be exactly that short lived and doomed to fail. these can be disheartening however like cig smokers and any other form of addict it often takes a number of failed attempts before a successful attempt is made. if this is you right now persevere you need to understand that you and only you can stop smoking. nobody else is gonna do it for you. i used a bit of a self hatred and asshole approach to help me quit. every time i thought about giving in and smoking id tell myself off. am i really so weak that i will give in im not addicted to heroin im trying to stop smoking a non physically addictive drug here. be realistic about what it is im trying to achieve. think of the insane feats human beings can achieve under crazy stress and shitty circumstances. i have no excuses if im to bitch out at this. my close friends at the time who are also heavy weed smokers continued to smoke. i forced myself to completely avoid them and the weed smoking environment because i knew it would be much easier if it was out of sight out of mind. to them i seemed like a dick on my tee total high horse completely avoiding them. they would send me messages and photos smoking and try to encourage me to join them once more. i got the cold shoulder a bit as though id decided to turn my back on the cult. as much as part of me wanted to cave and re join the safe familiar environment i resisted. the saying misery loves company is extremely relevant here. me and my friends were validating each other in our unhealthy weed smoking habits. i turned this negative into a positive. while they approached my abstinence with a haha bet you really wish you were smoking weed like us right now attitude i would tell myself that i am better than them with each passing day i didnt smoke. i wanted to think im missing out because im not smoking with them but the reality is they are missing out because they are continuing to smoke they were too weak to have the bottle to give it up. i wasnt. this sense of strength and accomplishment felt great and encouraged me massively to keep going. the sad thing is they didnt want me to smoke with them because they missed my company it was more about validating their bad habits. if we all did it together it wasnt quite as bad im happy to say that since then one of my friends has since had a very similar epiphany much like mine and also packed in the smoking. this im very glad of. he said my decision to stop made him look at his own habits and realise how unhealthy they were impacting his life in his own unique way different to mine. i dont have any resentment towards them as their behaviour was just a projection of their insecurity and desperation to be validated in their weed smoking. were still friends and i just dont smoke if im around the ones who do now. now for an overall thought forgive me if this is a bit deep. this is just my perception and way of rationalising my decision to stop. im a strong believer that life is what you make of it. every one of us has the choice to smoke weed or not to smoke weed. ask yourself what kind of people smoke weed habitually is that the person i want to be in my case the answer is no. is it making my life better or worse as a whole objectively ask yourself. we know that poor and disaffected people tend to have these kinds of destructive habits and ultimately theyre doing them to escape something. whether this is poverty a shit job shit social support system or whatever thats the general consensus. its the same for hard drug users and the majority of alcoholics. how many successful happy people with beautiful wives and holiday homes in the alps sit in the dark and smoke weed for 6 hours a night virtually none. ask yourself why the sad truth is that the most vulnerable people who do these things find it the hardest to break this cycle but by stopping the destructive habits and investing time and energy into fixing the broken parts of your life you have a much higher chance of being happier than if you continue down your dark spiral of substance misuse and self loathing if youre constantly hard up andor unhappy with the way your social life is much like i wasam to an extent smoking weed all the time is like shooting yourself in the foot big time. successful healthy women if youre a guy are uninterested in you because youre a sad stoner in their eyes no matter what way you perceive yourself. if you keep it a secret like i did then youre leading a fkn double life and its like having a secret mistress who you have to make time for on the side hahaha. if youre poor spending your last £100 on weed and cigs seems like a reasonable idea. multiple small releases of dopamine in a sad reality beats sitting at home bored with nothing to do. my advice is to reinvest your time and cash other places and the rest will slowly begin to fall into place. the rich non weed smoker with his holiday home and white picket fence house may well be in that position because he is much more lucky and privileged than you or i. by smoking weed chronically we widen the gap between him and us. by stopping our destructive habits and reinvesting our time and energy other places we can to some degree level the playing field and also have happy productive lives. i stopped smoking weed and spent the spare money on a gym membership and starting climbing. by doing this ive automatically given myself a massive personal identity change. im now the gym goer and climber not the sad weed smoker who has nothing going for him sorry if this is a bit long winded. there are other things i wanted to add but didnt want to ramble any more than i already have. the last part is my perception of reality and might not align with how you lot see constant weed use. thats totally fine. some people can use it in moderation and others still stand by it and defend it to the death. id say to them try taking two weeks off and see if you still feel the same about your habits. youve got this in the bag. you are much stronger than you give yourself credit for. its a mental battle and you can win it with a bit of self efficacy and determination go for it,joy
instead of smoking i painted this instead. the plant in the middle represents weed.,anger
weed interferes with your ability to feel boredand that is not a good thing weed was the ultimate time killer for me. i could smoke weed and whole days weekends weeks would pass by. im not kidding by the end of my smoking i could stay in bed for 4 days at a time just smoking sleeping watching tv and ordering take out to my door. weed allowed me to passively tolerate stupid youtube videos which i barely paid attention because i was too high to care. weed allowed me to pass on social events or activities because i was too high to get up and go. years of smoking weed left me with little to no interests hobbies or passions. i didnt need them because the time easily passed while i stayed fried. i just didnt have the motivation or or dedication to seek out new things. i was embarrassed by my lack of hobbies but my embarrassment caused me to smoke even more. it was a vicious cycle. now that im sober i get bored something that never happened when i was high. and the best part about being bored is that its my body and minds way of telling me to do something to try a new hobby or to watch a cool movie or to call a friend. in my 605 days of sobriety ive tried lots and learned so much about myself. i discovered that i love hot yoga horror movies parks running art museums facetimes interior design etc etc. i also discovered that some of the shit that i used to love while high like 711 food is no longer of my interest. my point in all of this is to say that being high hindered me so much. weed allowed me to be complacent with a life that was mediocre at best and painfully unfulfilling at worst.,sadness
i did it. i went to costco sober. im a housewife in my mid 30s. up until yesterday morning i was spending my days visiting parks or doing crafts with my toddlers. as soon as they went to bed at 7pm i would smoke like a chimney. on weekends i would eat edibles and do family stuff while stoned out of my mind. once a week i would get stupid high and spend like 600 at costco because being high made shopping so fun. i dont think ive gone grocery shopping sober in over 3 years. it was my mommy time after a long day with the kids. yesterday i went sober. i stuck to my grocery list. it wasnt awful. i think thats a good start.,joy
what have you accomplished since you quit smoking i stopped a week ago been in and out for a while and here is what ive gotten done in that week finished 3 sections of studying material for the actuarial exams cleaned the fuck out of my room had dinner with my family twice spent time hanging out with my little brother who still lives at home went to the gym 5 times 2 3 12 hour sessions each time wrote up a schedule for the next week worked full time while doing all these things have not eaten any junk food interesting how that becomes so much less of an issue when i do not smoke hung out with a coworker whos girlfriend recently broke up with him and he has been a little lonely recently having off today helped me get through a lot of that studying but apart from that these are things i would have probably avoided or half assed had i been smoking. i made it my new goal to not smoke this month of july taking an exam in august and my brother just said why not just wait until after the exam then i thought to myself why not wait until im satisfied with where my life is so new goal no more smoking until retirement jokes aside i feel amazing right now and im going to continue writing down what ive gotten done and what i plan to get done in the future leaving no time nor desire to smoke. so fellow members of rleaves what have you accomplished since you quit and what do you plan to accomplish side note this subreddit has been such an inspiration to me the support you guys give each other and have given me in the past is very humbling and i wish you guys nothing but the best on your journey.,joy
it just occurred to me today that you dont need drugs to be happy. there is someone there buried within you itching to come back out and that is the old you. dont forget about himher again stay strong and they will come back even if you think youve lost em for forever.,joy
why marijuana addiction can be so hard to let go of im 1 month sober now kinda missing pot but also slowly and surely learning how to enjoy things the same way when sober. here are some midnight thoughts on why marijuana addiction can be so difficult to accept and even harder to let go of when it comes to other drugs and alcohol the altered state were in is quite distinguishable. more often than not youre not in control of your actions but at some level you are still aware of them. with marijuana on the other hand that altered state starts becoming your reality. most of us smoke multiple times in a day making the addiction more ingrained in our sense of self. this is where it all messes up. our sober normal self becomes our altered self. why would you want to do something sober when you can be high and flow with it instead for example you want to have pizza but ofcourse you wo not have it sober because its so much better when youre high. the main problem your personality. i read somewhere that one of the hidden dangers of heavy marijuana use is the paralysis of personality development. a big reason i fell in love with marijuana is because of how creative it made me how much more i could enjoy my hobbies etc. so i started using it regularly before writing or painting. again thats where it all messed up. it went like more pot more art no pot no art and slowly just pot and no art. i used to see this as a writers block before i finally realised. we do not realise how covertly marijuana takes over our hobbies traits and overall personality. we end up never finding who we really are because we equate ourselves with the intoxicating effects of pot or with the withdrawal symptoms of it. although i do see how other drugs also block personality development but the reason this one is so much more difficult to accept is because we never really see it as a problem. we do not see it as an escape from reality we see it as reality itself. do you all agree tell me about your pov on this edit so happy to read your comments and be of help. not all of this stuff is just introspection i guess it just came to me after reading alot of blogs and talking to people. i wish all of you so much recovery and rediscovering yourselves through it 3 ive shared a bit of my journey here . i hope its helpful,joy

i used to think i knew some amazing secret and everyone who didnt smoke was missing out… turns out they knew the secret all along i hit 5 months sober today. got back from a 4 night holiday with my parents yesterday. when i was getting high all the time i couldnt stand being around them and they probably felt the same about me… i also wouldnt have gone if i knew i couldnt smoke every night while there. ive lost 50 pounds painted both of the bathrooms in parents house read 7 books made new friends started new hobbies been in therapy since quitting and been able to take new important steps with my business. i feel a new sense of clarity in my day to day life and have taken the power back into my hands in many ways. i used to sit on my stoned high horse and look down on the world thinking i knew best. i never wanted to admit my faults the main one being smoking hash and weed all the time. i was wrong. everyone else was right. well done to everyone else staying strong and thank you to everyone who shows support here it really helps,joy
a buddy messaged me saying he has weed. i messaged him back saying ty for the offer but i quit 26 days ago. looking back i would be lying if i said i did not want it but im proud of myself. every temptation i beat makes me stronger i guess.,joy
sober me wants to me high and high me wants to be sober its just like a switch but ive realised that when im running out or i know i wo not have enough to smoke as i want too i start to get panic attacks to get more as running out is basically hell on earth or thats what my mind convinces me of and makes me feel like. then the absolute second i light up a spliff and i know i have enough to chain smoke a joint every 30 minutes that evening i want nothing more than to be free of weed. so ill try and smoke what i have as fast as possible so i can try to be sober. then i begin to run low and panic starts i need more need more it becomes priority 1 to get more and get high. and then i smoke and i feel the familiar feeling of regret and wishing i did not have to be high and wishing for sobriety. but when im sober i always cave as i get like 10 hours in and say fuck this ill smoke forever as its not worth 2 weeks or 2 months of hell. and then i wanna get sober as soon as i get more. edit i fucked the title up. also i fucking did it again and bought more not even 4 hours after making this post. i literally just ca not seem to even get to 0 amount anymore,anger
day 5 all of a sudden i really needed to smoke so i ran 9k instead 🙏🏼🙏🏼,anger
my dog died because i was high about a month ago i was leaving my friends house and i had just took a dab. i had my dog with me and for some reason i just did not think to grab his leash when we walked out the door. 910 times he would have just walked right to my car. well this was that 10. he saw a rabbit chased it into the road and was hit by a car. literally the only car around came at that exact moment. it feels like the universe punishing me for being careless. i feel terrible. that night was the worst night of my life. people tell me not to blame myself but i know that hed be alive right now if i had just been more careful. i ca not say for sure that if i was sober i would have grabbed his leash but i probably would have. i loved him so much and my girlfriend loved him even more and now shell never see him again. i fucked up it was my responsibility to protect him and i did not even do the most basic thing of keeping him on the leash. ive been a daily smoker for years but for two weeks after that i did not smoke weed at all. but i slowly started again. i feel like smoking helped bring out some emotions that i wanted to repress which was good i think. i feel like this was a sign and a terrible lesson that i need to get my shit together. but i still have cravings. smoking weed was how i relaxed. i used to love getting high then playing with him or taking him on a walk. its friday afternoon and i just wanna get high. but i know i shouldnt. theres so much i want to accomplish and weed just slows me down. idk what the point of this post is. i guess i just needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading rip koda 💔,anger
hit my 6 month mark yesterday and celebrated it with a great climb with great friends.,joy
weed makes you introspective which is good until it isnt. when i was depressed weed was a teacher i could not have succeeded without. it helps you see beneath the surface of life and insofar as that helps you weed is good. now ive seen beneath the surface enough and im struggling to actually live a life in the physical world. diving deeper is just getting me further from our shared reality. im no longer learning so much as i am imagining things and believing them for a little while until i sober up and life continues. there is no long lasting impact to the things i imagine and believe while high nowadays so whereas once weed was a helper i think now its just a distraction. i just like the feeling of things making sense for a little while. weed showed me a world with colour and feeling to it. for this im eternally grateful and maybe one day i will need its help again. for now though i think its time for me to put the herb down and make reality home again. theres no shame in having had a habit as theres a time and place for everything in life even weed. our struggle is to recognise when the time for it has passed and to have faith that something new will come to fill that dank green hole in our hearts that mj used to fill. good luck and god bless all. 🙏,joy

replacing pot with cheeseburgers what if everyday you could not wait to get home to eat cheeseburgers while you were at work you thought about the cheeseburger you could not wait to eat later. you ate cheeseburgers while you did mundane taskschores to make them more enjoyable but that just prolonged the task bc you were also eating a cheeseburger. when you went to watch a sunset or to the park you thought cheeseburgers would make this so much better so you brought one along. starting up a movie let me prepare my cheeseburger real quick so we can have it while we watch. you shared your cheeseburgers with others hey want some many times you had a cheeseburger before bed too bc you thought it helps you sleep. you snuck away from familyfriends at parties to have your cheeseburger. you avoided and missed opportunities to meet up with familyfriends because you were too busy eating cheeseburgers. you spent hundreds of dollars per month on cheeseburgers. you worried about not having enough cheeseburgers for later when you got low. you felt kinda sick after eating them all the time but you also felt scared about your life without cheeseburgers. nothing against cheeseburgers but i think its pretty fair to say that consuming cheeseburgers in this way would be unhealthy you catch my drift.,sadness
ive smoked and consumed weed daily around 100mgday since i stopped smoking meth 1.5 years ago. i am incredibly scared to deal with myself but i realize that this is what i must do to accomplish my dreams and to learn how to form meaningful relationships with other people. two days sober. thank you all for you support and your kind words of encouragement. im hanging in there.,fear
so have some sober time behind you but you just relapsed. maybe you can think of it like chopping firewood. lets say you really need firewood so you make a promise to yourself that you would get out there every single day and chop firewood. for eighteen days you go out and chop chop chop. it is not easy but you have a growing wood pile to show for your efforts. then on the nineteenth day some friends come over and want to play video games but youre like i have to chop firewood but they put the pressure on and eventually you cave and just game all day. the next day you wake up and you feel really bad. you made a promise to yourself and you broke that promise. but let me ask you something when you finally walk outside to start chopping again is that big pile magically gone no its still there. its a monument to what you can achieve when you keep your promises to yourself and a reminder that you can do it. so you pick up the ax and start building it even higher. when you relapse youve just lost a day. thats all. your pile of days your successes so far are still there. brush yourself off start chopping again and before long you wo not believe the size of that woodpile.,sadness
i was in 3rd grade 9 years old the first time my dad handed me a lit joint. ill be 41 years old next month. i was in 3rd grade 9 years old the first time my dad who was drunk as usual handed me a lit joint. i breathed that hot smoke deeply into my young sensitive lungs as id seen him do many times. i immediately fell into a severe coughing fit. my dad laughed as if it were the funniest thing hed ever seen. i remember distinctly feeling ashamed and thinking that one day id be a real man like him and be able to hold in that hot smoke. thus began my decades long interest fascination and ultimate infatuation with this plant this drug. i started using marijuana and drinking and cigarettes regularly by the time i was 14 all with my parents approval and even encouragement. by the time i was 17 i could hold my drink and smoke with any man. i thought at the time as did my delinquent friends that my parents were cool for this but in retrospect i realize that they basically saddled my immature undeveloped mind with these addictions and as a consequence i entered into adulthood at a huge disadvantage. needless to say i still carry around hurt confusion and anger towards them for this. fortunately for me i met and married a great gal at 23 who made me want to become a better man and basically saved my life. i quit smoking cigarettes at age 25 the morning my son was born. threw a nearly full pack in the dumpster behind the hospital and never looked back. i continued to drink and smoke weed heavily though. my wife who has never used any substance disapproved of my use but was extraordinary patient with me. i guess she saw something in me under all my exterior mess something i was unable to even see in myself. i had an epiphany of sorts on my 30th birthday and in what seems like a flash of insight realized with crystal clarity that my health was the most valuable possession that i would ever own and vowed from that moment forward to take an active ownership in my own health. i was very overweight and unfit and had high blood pressure a future heart attack in the making. i quit drinking that day and never touched it again. it was tough as hell but next month will be 11 years of sobriety from alcohol. i started exercising daily mostly running and cycling and changed my relationship with food and went from 220 to 155 pounds in one year and have maintained this healthier weight ever since. marijuana though proved and still proves to be my hardest chemical crutch to hang up for good. i think its because it was so deeply ingrained into my psyche from such a young age. everything just seemed so drab and uninteresting without it. ive quit weed many times over the past 10 years hence my username several of those times for over 1 year once for over 2 years. i always seem to manage though regrettably to find a way to return to this long lost love of mine. thats the irresistible seductive power of this drug for me. i reach a point in my sobriety where i truly begin to feel joy and contentment in life without weed and then as if i forget why i quit i pick it up again only to quickly realize again why i quit in the first place. its a lovehate relationship an abusive relationship a viscous cycle. throughout this whole process ive fortunately been able to keep this side of me hidden from my son who has no idea about this aspect of my life and would be shocked and confused if he were to ever find out. last summer my 14 year old son and i rode bikes bicycles all the way across the country from mexico to canada 2400 miles mostly on remote dirt roads along the spine of the rockies thru the states of new mexico colorado wyoming and montana. it took us 49 days and was an absolutely incredible experience for us both. we carried everything with us on our bikes and slept under the stars most nights. i wanted to show him among other things that you dont need to have drugs and alcohol to have a good time. something my own father failed miserably at teaching me. i hit my one year weed free mark again while on that epic journey with my son and was very proud of myself for doing so because the cravings and opportunity for using were certainly present along the way especially in colorado. in what was really a sweet and generous gesture my dad called me out of the blue and said he wanted to make the long 3 day drive to the canadian border and pick us up instead of us taking the train home as we had planned. it was very nice of him. but heres the thing there are many things that trigger my impulsive urge to smoke weed but none more powerful than the presence of my dad. i strongly associate the presence of my dad with smoking weed and knowing this worried that i would be unable to resist the urge during the long drive home. it wasnt 30 minutes down the road when we stopped at a rest area. while my dad and son were using the rest room i opened the glove box and grabbed my dads little tin box that i knew would be there. i quickly loaded a bowl and took 4 or 5 deep tokes and was almost instantly awash with that old familiar euphoric embrace mixed with equal parts shame and guilt. i smoked with my dad at the motel later on that night and again early the next morning and again the following night and morning but havent smoked again since. even just smoking those 5 times brought about a period of withdrawals for me. . .anxiety depression etc. it only left me wanting more and more and more and more moderation for me simply isnt an option. once is too many and a thousand times isnt enough. im sitting here now with 6 months of complete sobriety and though i do still think about and crave weed i generally feel pretty good and have definitely reached a place where non chemically stimulated joy and contentment have returned to life. the addicted mind is a sneaky little persistent bastard and i feel now more than ever before that ive finally managed to wrap my hands around its slippery little neck and put it out of its self induced misery once and for all. if youve made it this far thank you for allowing me to share my story. believe it or not i tried to keep it as brief as possible and left a lot of stuff out. i should write a book. i love that folks from all backgrounds and walks of life can come here to this great community to give and receive encouragement and support to one another no matter where we happen to be in our shared struggle to break free from the chain that binds us. much love and stay strong friends ❤️💪,sadness
its is 420 pm which means this is my first sober 24 hours in 15 years. just wanted to share a tiny victory.,joy
today im celebrating 365 days of choosing myself over marijuana i really couldnt have done it without this community. ive gotten so much advice and found such a strong support system via this subreddit. i have no desire to go backward. i really love who i am now and im excited to keep going. gonna make myself some blueberry pancakes to honor myself and my journey. thanks to you all. edit i want to answer some questions that ive been asked about my journey thus far i started smoking weed when i was around 2021 and by the time i was 23 i was a pothead im 30 now. i abused marijuana because i was depressed lost and confused about my life trajectory and wanted to numb the pain i felt about my career and my family dynamics. i ruined many many relationships due to weed. i was not a thoughtful or present friend and i went through long periods of time feeling lonely and misunderstood. i struggled with how to maintain my relationships i could not keep up hobbies my mental health tanked and i continued using weed to numb the pain. i knew that i had to quit smoking for about 2 years before i actually did it. i was always bargaining with my addiction and trying to find a way any way to keep the high going. i cheated on urine tests do not ask stole from people lied to get high. last april i hit rock bottom because at that point i had been smoking before and after work and my performance suffered as a result. this also triggered further negative self talk and i smoked even more in order to cope. finally i was terminated due to an overall shitty performance and i was relieved because i knew that this was as bad as it could get and i had to make a change. i smoked my last j on april 7th 2019. the road to recovery sucked for a long time before it got better. i have had brief stints of sobriety no more than 3 months in the past but always went back. this time i was so desperate for change that i found myself in nama meetings reading self help books meditating changing my social circle. just anything to get over the hump. i downloaded i am sober so that i could hold myself accountable highly recommend. i knew that if i could just get to 6 months i could get to a year. the normal withdrawals were there at first. i remember during the first few weeks having thishollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. it was not hungerit was just emptiness. emptiness at my core that i normally filled with weed. waking up and not being able to fill that was incredibly hard to face. i cried a lot. and i also felt all of the anger disappointment in myself resentment and sadness that i had allowed myself to ignore over the years. getting clean did not make me or my life perfect. i am so imperfect its hilarious. but i am self aware and i have the drive to improve as much as i can. i can feel emotions i can feel bored and be ok with it. i can exercise meditate keep my space clean and perform well at work without looking for a treat like a dog. im a grown ass woman these are things that im supposed to do i do not need a treat for getting up and handling my fcking business. idk ive just leveled up as a human being and i appreciate it. someone asked if i crave weed anymore. no. the truth that i did not want to face was that it had not felt good to smoke weed for a long time. in fact it was starting to suck. i didnt like how i felt at all. i did not like how my day would be gone as soon as i lit up. the problem was that i was so stuck in the web that i could not get out of the habit so i convinced myself that i liked it. if i could give any advice at this point it would be to please keep going. you went however many years of your life before that first toke surviving and living just fine without weed. you do not need this. not to be happy not to be social not to find a movie interesting not to eat not to fuck. remove the veil and take a closer look at who you really are inside. also relapse is a part of the journey. do not hate yourself for slipping up. get back on that horse and do not look back. forgive yourself for your past mistakes and love yourself enough to know that you deserve the best that life can offer. its not over for you as my dad says theres never a happy ending in the middle of the story so keep on living,sadness

new 420 goals,joy
things i do not miss about weed wasting money. waiting around for a drug dealer only to be ripped off. feeling pissed off if im unable to score. not being able to remember anything. feeling anxious and depressed all the time. oversleeping and waking up feeling more tired than when i went to bed. having dark and sunken looking eyes. getting the munchies and eating shitty food all the time. having absolutely no motivation. having trouble articulating my words. not being able to feel relaxed without being stoned. wasting time lying around all day. really makes me realise how much the cons outweigh the pros.,anger
the pitfall of being weed happy here is what i have discovered in my stepping away from cannabis. when i would smoke getting high was always the same. it was a predictable and familiar experience i call weed happy. weed happy doesnt change it is always the same experience and no matter what else is going on when i smoked i just got weed happy. since stepping back from cannabis all other forms of happiness emerge. some are much more difficult to achieve but the joy experienced is powerful like the joy of finishing a long week of work or even the joy of waking up the day following a day of intense craving but choosing not to smoke. whenever i used to smoke to celebrate the organic joy of whatever i had accomplished vanished and i was just weed happy again. understand that weed happy is a very specific very narrow type of joy and other greater deeper happinesses are out there you just have to work harder to get them. but trust me they are worth it.,joy
my first kid is due tomorrow and i could not be more happy with my progress,joy
high me wants to be sober but sober me wants to be high. i hate it. i love it. its a cycle thats been going on for years. i feel like weed changed me for the better but it was a long time ago that i started. now i feel i have learnt all there is to learn from it and i just abuse it. at night time when im high i feel it in my being that i dont want to be this way but when i wake up in the morning its like ive completely forgotten how high me feels about smoking and all i can think about is making sure i have enough to get to that state again and when i do i feel like i dont want to be smoking. i feel so stupid edit wow i wasnt expecting this to resonate with so many. ive read all of your comments and all i can say is that you all sound like such incredibly good and supportive people. im proud to be a stoner if only to be grouped with you guys. now its time to prepare to get back to being the real me. and hopefully soon ill be able to help some of you like you have helped me. good luck everyone you guys are awesome,sadness
stopping smoking weed doesnt solve all your problems it allows you to realise what your problems are i am one month sober today having smoked daily since i was 13 years old. 28 now. finally able to take responsibility for things i have been suppressing and feeling tons better. it can get pretty lonely during this isolation especially when you are clear headed for the first time in years. it also is bringing back a lot of emotions and my mind seems to be processing things that happened a long time ago. excited for the thc to finally be leaving my body. instead of smoking i now go out for evening walks workout twice a day and eat healthily. i also have managed to stop drinking beers. the first week or so after i stopped smoking i seemed to be replacing it with a few bottles each night. had only a few beers total the last 2 weeks. all in all i am feeling so much better and highly recommend anyone lurking here wondering whether to try stopping or not to give it a go. i wish i had done it years ago thanks to everyone here for their continued support,sadness
80 days sober heres a comic i made a couple weeks ago about how ive changed,joy
just paid off 3 of my credit card debts with the money i have not spent on weed 💅 even though im mostly out of cash rn it feels super good. im at my parents house so i do not spend much on anything. weed used to drain my wallet like crazy i do not even know how i kept up with all that shit. do not smoke ppl. spend that hard earned money on yourselves. 🌊,joy
you never hit rockbottom with weed im 26 yo and i started smoking when i was 14yo. it very quickly became a huge part of my life and i would smoke on weekends in the beginning and by 20 i was smoking everyday whenever i can. it just becomes part of your life and there is such a culture around it. a lot of my good friends also smoke weed everyday and for at least 5 years i have wanted to quit but never had the willpower to do it. im a comic and a writer and weed completely saps all my momentum. i realized that there is no rockbottom with weed. i am never going to lose my house and ruin all my relationships but it does have a glass ceiling. it prevents me from actually making something of myself. i want a lot in this life time and weed just seems like its an anchor around my neck. sometimes i think i ruined my brain smoking all through my developing years but i try not to think that way. i do not even think weed is inherently bad for you it just my personal relationship has become very unbalanced and has encroached into an addiction. on top of everything i only would smoke spliffs weed and tobacco so i am quitting both substances at the same time. anyway i am almost a week into quitting cold turkey and honestly i feel really great no insane cravings its just kind of hard to sleep. just want to make this post so it is even more real for me. thanks guys,joy
the goal is not to be sober its to love yourself so much that you do not need to smoke. love yourself.,joy
to anyone who caved yesterday like me let it be a lesson as to the power of addiction. for me being at my university house is where problems arise. i have the freedom to smoke where i want and when i want i have dealers on call lots of places to order takeaway i came home for the virus and because we were locked down i stopped for a couple of weeks. after the first week is where i start to realise what a grip weed has on me. i was irritable all the time i was unhappy and slightly depressed. i didnt want to talk to people didnt want to really do anything ‘valuable like study or workout. then weed comes back into play boredom turns into ‘if only i had some weed or ‘it would so nice to smoke and do nothing right now. your brain tricks you into remembering all the good times you had smoking. so what did i do i made up a lie that i needed to go back to university to get some work done and that id be back in a week. i wasnt coming here to work i was coming here so i could smoke again. i went out of my way and had my parents drive me over an hour just so i could smoke. i wont lie to you and say i didnt mean to do this. the whole time i was on the way here i was so so happy i could smoke again. i was fucking in love with the idea i could smoke a spliff again. and you know what it fucking sucked. ive been in a hole for two days smoked 3 grams that was meant to last me a week in a day and a half. when i was high i found myself depressed anxious paranoid and everything in between. the feeling of ‘why have i done this came back immediately. and theres the lesson. addiction will literally have you love the idea of doing it again just one more time. reality sets in and youre back to square one. day one again for me. im going back home after two days because i know i will make no progress here. i am so so scared that in a week i will want to smoke again and lose my motivation but here is proof thats the wrong decision.,anger
my use got so bad that i checked myself into a rehab center at first i felt stupid why am i going to rehab its just weed. after being here for three days i realize its the best move ive made in years. several people here are here for weed too. i have to remind myself that im not weak for being here. this is really the best thing i can do for myself. smoking weed all day long for 12 years sunk me into a deep depression. i can do this edit thanks everyone. your words have all been so kind and affirming. love you all,sadness
day 7306 im subduction founder of rleaves and today marks 20 years free of cannabis alcohol and other drugs. i wanted to contribute some thoughts on anniversaries and im happy to stick around today to answer any questions and chat about whatever you like. hey everybody for those who do not know me or know me only from getting mod notices i founded rleaves seven years ago and have had the best front row seat imaginable as each of you grew this sub into the kind supportive and wonderful place that it is. my official quit date is july 15th 1998 which is the day that i entered the smithers rehab center in new york city for outpatient treatment. i spent just over a year there and i credit my experience at smithers with my sobriety and many of the things i learned there are built into rleaves. so what are my pillars of recovery what are the seven secrets to keeping your sobriety number six will amaze you there are as you might imagine so many after 20 years so i spent a little time in the past few days trying to think of the answer to the question if you could only tell people one thing one piece of advice to help them keep their sobriety what would it be. after a good amount of thought i think its one day at a time is not just a mantra or an encouragement its a concrete strategy. i see so many posts here on leaves like how can i possibly quit for the rest of my life the addiction community is full of sayings and one of them is do not look up do not look down. a lifetime can feel unachievable so its a temptation to never start. or as your day count increases it can feel unsustainable and tempt you to give up. so do not quit for a lifetime do not quit for a month or a week. just quit for today. promise yourself that no matter how bad it gets you simply wo not smoke today. if its awful and it makes you decide that you never want to quit again as long as you live then thats fine but you still are not going to smoke today. youll start up again tomorrow. then tomorrow morning promise yourself again. keep your scope achievable. there are no points for difficulty if you make it through a day without smoking you win. does it work well the only thing i can promise from my personal experience is that although i have no idea what tomorrow will bring i can promise it works for at least 7306 days. ill be around for the rest of the afternoon and evening to chat about anything youre curious about thanks everyone for making this the place that it is. subduction,joy
weed changes people just needed to vent my feelings as i feel like ive only just started seeing how weed truly affected my life and my relationships. a couple of years ago i met a guy and i instantly felt something. we worked together and soon began talking more and more we eventually ended up seeing each other. i soon learnt that he had issues with substances in the past and he had been sober for many years which i thought was amazing we had so much fun together he was the love of my life and i adored everything about him. we would do things together go out to eat go fishing spend time in nature and just enjoy each others company. months passed and it seemed almost too good to be true. we would never fight and we were best of friends until he reintroduced the weed back into his life. at first it was just to sleep and he would only smoke at night before bed and a very minimal amount at that. sometimes we would even share some and have a great night after a few months the weed became more easily accessible and he fell back into the cycle of smoking from the morning to the night and i followed in his footsteps. the man i once loved began to turn into a careless and lazy person and i felt as if each day he was becoming more and more distant. life became all about smoking weed and it was all we did together to the point that we werent even being intimate because we were both too stoned out of our minds. we were both addicted and it was breaking us apart. it seemed that with each day came a new issue or argument we just didnt seem to understand each other anymore. he became mean spirited and seemed to enjoy tormenting me. eventually i left i was now alone and i had never missed someone so much. i began smoking more and more smoking bongs all the time. what happened to him began to happen to me. i became distant with my family and friends and i became lazy and felt so lost. now i can see so clearly that marijuana changed us both to the point that we were no longer compatible. i cant help but feel so incredibly guilty about the person i became. i am so sorry to my family and friends that i may have hurt and i feel so embarrassed i let myself believe that weed was this harmless fix for my problems. i am so beyond happy i found this support group and i thank anyone who takes the time to read this x heres to the rest of our lives sober and happier than ever 💖,sadness
my mother died on saturday. today marks 6 months sober. i could get high or drunk but i wont. cancer took her from me but i refuse to let my addiction take the memories ive just made of her even the ones that hurt to think about. i have regretted getting high a million times during my period of use. i have not regretted being sober once since i stopped. mom got to see me clear headed for the first time in two decades got to see me succeed in getting my first technology certification got to see me moving back into tech with a healthy mindset and brain. without sobriety that would not have happened and id be well on my way to losing my memories of her in a haze. if youre thinking about quitting do it. if you fall short pick yourself up and try again. figure out why you want to smoke then address that and try again. youll get there and i suspect you wo not regret it. i dont. edit id like to thank each of you individually for your responses but i think you can understand why that is a little more than im able to give right now. i hope this group message will suffice. thank you for your support and kind words. im still very numb over the whole process as i and my wife were needed to provide the end of life support for mom i saw her looking very different than i was expecting but thanks to my support team i.e. wife we were able to help her pass with the greatest amount of dignity kindness and love that we could. now its time to work through the papers and get her estate in order so dad does not have to struggle with anything but his grief. your words helped me to let go of some of the pain im feeling. i have a hard time crying over just about anything and many of your responses brought me to tears and much needed relief. im glad that ive been able to provide inspiration to some of you as it makes this pain a little more positive. this hurts so badly. i would not trade it for even a single moment of drug induced peace. get sober. stay sober. do it for yourself not for anyone else. its going to hurt but thats an important part of being alive and being here now. be here now. you can do it.,sadness
weed creates a problem and then becomes the perfect medicine for the problem it created. imagine this one day you wake up from sleep and have a small rash on your arm. very small. one of your friends gives you an ointment and tells you to apply it to the rash. you apply the ointment and the rash disappears. you are content. few days later the rash is back on your hand. except its a little bit bigger. you apply the cream again. rash is gone. in a week the rash is back even bigger and you apply the cream again and it disappears. you keep doing this until the rash comes back the size of your entire arm. only then you realize that the ointment was making the rash worse. you stop applying it and the rash slowly over the next few months disappears. and never comes back. this is what weed addiction really is. it causes issues and then convinces you that its the cure to them. its so insidious. replace the rash with a bad break up and the ointment with weed. day 7 lets fucking go. edit yes guys this is from allah carr. i read it there years ago and thought it would help everyone here.,joy
epiphany when i have weed its easy to imagine quitting when i do not any weed its easy to imagine smoking repsonsibly. anybody else feel like this,joy
always remember that you will regret smoking for a reason or another. but youll never regret resisting the temptation and not smoking. regrets are heavy to carry around on a daily basis. being proud of yourself is something you can build on. you can do it,joy
do not use will power to quit weed how i quit to quit weed we need to change our mindsets around the substance fighting your way out of the addiction with willpower is a futile method of quitting because it is a limited resource. our brains are hard wired to seek pleasure and avoid pain therefore if you are fighting your way through your addiction with willpower it sends messages to the brain that its pleasurable to smoke weed and painful to quit. you can fight for days weeks maybe even months with this method but there comes a time where you end up caving in. your saying to yourself no i ca not have that joint i would really love a bowl right now but i cant do not smoke weed do not go out and buy weed etc. the alternative is instead of fighting your cravings when they arise just say to yourself im so happy that i am now someone who does not smoke weed im so happy i no longer need to waste money on something that ruins my physical and mental health im so happy that i can now have real growth and progress in my life im so happy that i now have more then enough energy to get things done and am feeling great. this is associating pleasure with not smoking weed and pain with continuing that cycle now your brain is on board and cravings will lessen. also always make sure to observe your cravings instead of wrestling with them. the second you start getting in that inner dialogue with your brain like yeah im happy i quit but 1 toke would not hurt do not react to that thought just observe it and let it pass without judgement,joy
2 months sober today. dont really have anyone to celebrate or share this with so just thought id come here to do so. wouldnt be be at this point without this sub and i dont really share my journey into sobriety with friends and family on social media but i wanted to share this occasion as im quite proud of myself for making it this far. my will is starting to falter but ive been down the relapse road before and i know exactly where ill end up smoking everyday and feeling super shitty disappointed with myself vowing to get clean again ecs ecs. heres to another 2 months and beyond if you took the time to read this thank you have a wonderful night and stay safe. sending my love and support to those who need it.,joy
the first few times weed will reveal the world to you. after getting addicted and abstainingsobriety reveals yourself to you. weve all been there. truly profound thoughts on the world society creativity ideas spirituality etc. how long does that last whats the outcome after all those thoughts for me nothing. just more smoking and more thinking without any action. im sure there are many people who can function remarkably well smoking everyday without any negative consequences but that is not me. i sat at around 21days sober for the first part of december. the festive mood around christmas and being around other smokers i decided to end my streak. i was quickly back at smoking 4 times a day waking and baking etc. im so disappointed but i want to pick up the pieces and start again at the height of my sober streak i cleaned out a cupboard in my bedroom that i have literally never sorted out for more than 10 years. i never used the cupboard for 10years cos it was unusable because it was full of clutter. that is absolutely stupid when i think about it but my stoner mind was never bothered about getting down to it cos well video games netflix etc. theres a childlike feeling that comes from sobrieyabstinence. a child never feels happy because of a substance. a child generates happiness from experiences. i remember a sober day towards the end of the streak i had had a great workout. weights. cranked out 5 intense sets. energy levels were returning. the witcher was playing in the background i was buzzing. felt like a man again for the first time in i dunno how long. that same child like natural high. theres probably so much more that weedaddiction costs us than meets the eye. edit thanks a million for the responses and upvotes. i really appreciate them all best of luck to all,joy
i put down the joint and picked up a beautiful life its a saturday evening and ive just come home from the grocery store. ive whipped up some dinner and im about to sit down to write a paper for school. my apartment is clean. im wearing freshly washed pajamas. my bank account isnt overdrafted. my bed is made. these are tiny simple things but they are things that i could not do when i was smoking. these are things that make me happy today. tonight im not twiddling my thumbs waiting for the dealer to text me back to tell me that theyre close. im not counting down the minutes until hes at my door. im not worried about whether i have enough rolling papers to get me through the night. im not lying to myself by saying that ill just smoke one joint and then start my work. im not paranoid to see a neighbor in the hallway anxious that they can smell the stench of weed coming from my apartment. im not ordering fast food online and then falling asleep before it arrives. there is a quote i love that says true happiness is genuine interest in the details of your day. choose the details of your life carefully. they add up. im writing this post to remind myself of how my life with weed was so shitty in the subtlest smallest ways. thanks for reading.,joy
i wrote 20 reasons why i should stay the hell away from weed. do any of these resonate with you 1. costs me a ton of money 25g over here 2. week long binges i abuse it 247 always use way too much 3. daysweeksmonths go by really quick 4. my memory becomes terrible 5. everything becomes an excuse to smoke smoke whenever no one is in the house. 6. i isolate myself more 7. i stop helping around the house 8. it affects cognition short and long term as well as my development as a 21 year old 9. im not productive make progress with hobbies 10.i become moody and depressed. im meaner when i havent had my weed yet that day and become difficult to live with. 11. i gain a lot of weight eat way too much 12. i forget to take my medication 13. i sometimes forget to brush teeth 14. i use impulsively and compulsively 15. my sleep pattern gets fucked 16. im way less physically active 17. it messes with my medication 18. it worsens my bipolar mood swings adhd paranoia and anxiety. very illegal and frowned upon over here contributes to this. 19. it becomes my primary source of happiness which is terrible as it causes so much unhappiness 20. i have to compromise my values and morals at times for example lie about what i did last weekend etc to family i wrote this list as after a few weeks off i convince myself that its okay to start again and ill control my use but then the cycle repeats. this has happened like 30 times over the past 2 years and its the exact same thing every time. im sure its cost me easily more than 10k and i already have student debt. i want to improve my life and make progress and this is incompatible with this lifestyle. weed feels so amazing to me. the adrenaline rush and instant great mood is way too addicting. orgasms are extremely powerful food and music is amazing. a lot of my friends dont describe weed as that euphoric compared to how i feel on it. this worries me as all of these are signs of addiction. its time to take control of my life. been sober for 2 weeks i feel okay and when i get the itch i need to read over this list as a reminder. do any of you have the same issue edit it appears that a lot of you do i wish everyone the best of luck in accomplishing your goals and im glad some of you found some value from reading this list.,joy
lol. doing some groceries and walked up to the cashier. the cashier replaced each other and she passed next to me she points to the ground she says is this your bag of weed i picked it up. looked at those freaking big buds for a moment i said no. and gave it back to her i replied hes probaly too stoned to find it back. we both laugh and she stores it behind the counter. walked out the supermarket and craved like hell for a minute. then i reminded myself addiction is one hellava feeling moved on with my day. on day 33 now. proud but cravy. letsgetitit,joy
weed absolutely wrecks your reward systems making smoking the only truly rewarding thing in your life. marijuana has a powerful effect on a persons reward system. now this is not apparent if you smoke once or twice a month or maybe even a week but the reason we are all here is because we ca not do that. most of us here are 5 times a week smokers. many are also wake and bakers who ca not remember the last time they went more than half a day not stoned. the only real problem with weed and im honestly gonna say there is not many of them is it wreaks havoc on your ability to enjoy life without it. how many times have you said im gonna get high and then only to not do it and usually end up high on your couch for the rest of the evening this is because your brains natural rewards system which increases feelings of happiness and contentment is being heavily compromised by marijuana. usually the things you smoke to escape from are actually not bad things. they are things that are actually important in life such as your studies career goals or general things that need to get done. all marijuana does is force you to live in the moment. now this is not always bad but when the moment subsides you still have the same issues as before only now a day has passed and you are potentially in a worse position than before. marijuana has a time and place for sure. it is a beautiful drug that can deeply enrich a lot of experiences or open a newfound appreciation for things we take for granted. however when used in excess just like mdma alcohol cocaine or other drugs its effects can be devastating. the thing with those other drugs is that they are rather destructive and you usually ca not go long as a daily user without your life collapsing in some aspects. weed does not do that. weed can create the illusion that everything is fine and youre content but what youve really done is lowered your standards for your life. although marijuana does make experiences better how many of them can you actually remember at the time the movie seems amazing the music sounds heavenly a simple walk in the park may be euphoric but when you come back to reality how much of this benefits your future self personally ive found the only way to get over the desire for weed is to cut it out entirely. the problem with using weed as an amplifier is that that becomes your new norm and lifes occasional monotony becomes overwhelming without the crux of marijuana to entertain you. life is not meant to be 100 fun and happy games all the time. a lot of the time its fucking boring and mundane. work is not meant to be fun. school is not meant to be fun. but its rewarding. compare the reward to choosing between a salad or burger for dinner. the burger will be instantly rewarding like marijuana but may make you feel badly afterwards. the salad on the other hand will be something that could benefit you in the future like school like work you eat it because of an overarching goal. the best way to get over weed is to not have it. if you set aside a day every weekend or second week or even month that is still your reward and subconsiously you are looking forward to that more and not living in the moment. when i say moment in this context i do not mean the high moments we have all had but rather living with a clear view of your future goals and making the most of any opportunities that are presented before you. the moment is beautiful life can be beautiful but its work hard work. the hard work is not forever though its a lot of initial effort to get to where you want to get to and then that becomes the new norm and youve entered a new state of being a new and better you. one of the best motivators to quit weed is to sit down and make a list of every time weed has adversely affected your life compared to its positive. youll find weeds positives are limited to food tasting good some funny chats with friends and the occasional moment of drug induced epiphany. these are not tangible or real experiences and they do not really serve to enrich your life in any way. sure they can be fun but real things like exercise study learnt skills and romance are things with actual value to your life. really sit down and write down every time weed had a negative impact every time you did not plan as well as you could have because you were high every time you broke a promise to your significant other or family about smoking every time you missed out on an opportunity because you preferred to sit alone by the dim light of your tv while you ate pop tarts and watched family guy. do not smoke just do not do it. but do not sit around home being sad go out join a gym learn martial arts go running learn to play guitar. do one of the many many many things you can still do while youre young and have time. when you really start living in the moment youll realise how much little time we have in the day and how precious each second is. weed has a time and place but right now its not for you. thats why youre on the page. live,joy
i think smoking weed was actually causing a good amount of my anxiety for the past year and a half or so ive smoked weed pretty much every night to help me sleep as well as to calm me down after a long day a few days ago i made the decision to stop smoking due to how horrible i felt and how my lungs sounded after i decided to start jogging for fitness. im half way through my shift at work today and i have felt little to no anxiety compared to how awful my work days went before and it is such a fantastic feeling i just wanted to share because it came as such a surprise to me im very glad i made the decision to quit.,joy
my therapist asked me who was in the drivers seat of my decisions if im high all the time 5 days clean so far,joy
weed is the most deceptive drug out there. its currently day 4 of no weed and i feel like an absolute mess. depressed no energy no appetite very little sleep. i feel like i wasted my youth away in a constant stoned daze. started smoking it when i was 15 and im now 34. ill never be able to get those years back and its really fucking with my head to be honest. i feel so ashamed of myself. im absolutely fucking disgusted with myself. i always told myself that weed was harmless it just relaxes me bro you know the bullshit we all come out with. the irony is i once had a benzodiazepine habit and i found that easier to quit than weed. heres comes the daunting realisation that weed is just as addictive and harmful as any other drug. i think what has made weed so addictive to me is the fact that you lie to yourself and tell yourself its not doing you any harm when in reality youre an underachieving stoner. without the weed addiction youd have a better life by now and would have achieved much more in life. facts. ive come to the conclusion that weed is the most deceptive drug out there. everyone knows heroin or crack will fuck your life up very quickly but almost nobody who smokes weed realises that it has them by the balls worse than any other drug and is doing real damage to life and relationships.,sadness
today marks 1 year of sobriety after 22 years of chronic abuse no matter what you tell yourself heres the truth. if i can do it so can you. heres my rant today marks exactly 365 days of sobriety and i thought i would just let the fellow stoner know that it is possible. a happy drug free life is possible. the truth is that nobody except you is going to keep you sober you have to really want this thing and you have to make arrangements with yourself to get through it. i wont sit here and try to bullshit you by saying every day has been beautiful bliss there has been some challenges along the way. mainly because once i stopped smoking heavy heavy grass shatter dabs rigs jiggs edibles hash diamonds keef and mother fuckin butterzzzz well then i realized the main reason i was always high was because i felt so uncomfortable sober. i had been running from myself and reality for 22 consecutive years from the age of 15 to 37 roughly. i was spending thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars at dispensaries and with shady dealers back in the day simply self medicating my own bullshit. the problem was the medication called marijuana was compounding my internal struggles it was fuelling my anxiety compounding my depressions shattering my self esteem isolating me from all the support i truly wanted and absolutely destroying my marriage and relationship with my 2 children. i have since had my 3rd child sober and a new little puppy to boot when you become vulnerable with yourself and admit that you have a serious problem then you can begin to make the necessary changes to fix it the thing you must remember is to never lose the dark reality of what it was like when you were using. some of my hardest days in this year were when i was doing great and everything was nice and i had money and the kids were happy and my wife was back in love then i would suddenly tell myself well its not so bad why can kyle and joe smoke a blunt and i cant it would be fine right i mean im better now those were the moments in my sobriety that i had to really see what my old addiction was trying to do and had to remember how bad it really was at the end of using i knew that if i have one puff just one puff the obsession of getting stoned will return and that is not something i am willing to do. joe and kyle may be ok but me no way man if i have one puff im smoking the whole god damn bag and thats real talk. i want everybody to know no matter who you are and how deep you are into the addiction that they can do it and they just have to get through the waves to get the feeling of surfing that good life without everyday struggle and obsession. i know what its like i was as addicted as it comes all day everyday no matter what was the type of chronic i was for 22 years didnt matter the country the job the relationship the event driving flying diving i was constantly stoned. heres a little advise to help you through be gentle and respect your own recovery support yourself do things that are positive be ready for days of battle with your mind be prepared to let go of the old you be honest with people around you let them know you are struggling or having a hard day dont be hard on yourself if you do slip but dont let the slip turn into a ten year slide meditate im serious this shit works love yourself and enjoy the journey with all the ups and downs. ask for help if you need it that is true strength try not to replace one bad addiction with another try all those things you wanted to try but were always to scared to try last but not least have fun in your recovery as you build traction in your own recovery you will see that life is quite beautiful and amazing without drugs without constant refuelling. take it from me and the many others that have walked this journey it has its benefits mostly being you get to finally be with your true self and available to others all the time at anytime. thank you for 1 year thank you for today.,joy
my life is not dull without weed. weed makes my life dull. im done smoking weed. im so annoyed with feeling like i need to get high before i do anything. i can convince myself whatever the task is itll be better after i smoke. it never is. what im really feeling is my brain seeking comfort because its so used to the instant gratification that it fights to avoid anything related to delayed gratification. ive used the excuse that all my friends smoke so i ca not quit. im my own keeper. my friends will still love me. thanks for listening. i think this is the time it finally sticks. wish me luck,joy
why you need to quit smoking cannabis a note to myself why you need to quit smoking cannabis a note to myself i wrote this for myself but decided to share since we are all in the same boat. its a collection of my thoughts on why i am quitting and quotes that motivate me to stay sober. when you smoke it you want to keep using until there is none left you continually seek cannabis even against your best judgment. it zaps your motivation to study your contempt with yourself where your at and dont strive to improve it makes you dull and tired you socially distance yourself from friends family and ultimately new experiences it costs lots of money that money could be invested your personality ends up being built around it you miss tons of social and travel opportunities a high life is a unfulfilled one a man is someone who puts others needs before his own. can you say you do that when your high all the time your less alert and unable to make clear decisions. you neglect the health of your body you neglect hobbies your best self isnt dependent on a substance you get too comfortable. remember comfort is good in moderate doses but being uncomfortablefacing adversity is what helps us to grow. purpose over pleasure wes watson you arent present enough to have a feasible or profitable side hustle you neglect spiritual growth pot makes you okay with feeling bored and its when your bored you should be learning a new skill or discovering a new science. if you smoke pot all the time you may look back and realize you never made progress with anything. south park quote it messes with your weigh and appetite. its not a source of true happiness. it masks your emotions you dont need it its going to be hard your brain is going to try and trick you that temporarily pain will go away the temporary pleasure is not worth it please do not smoke you could always smoke again. weed will be around forever. the thing is though you wont. no one is going to hold a gun to your head and force you to smoke. its all on you because of that the key is to stay consistent in your thoughts of why you quit. its your attitude and your commitment to being disciplined that will drive you to your goals not weed. dont fall for the illusion of comfort you think itll bring. your time here is not guaranteed and you cannot afford to be distracted the way cannabis makes you. you will need reminders some days. maybe often. but its about consistency and discipline. if your life was a movie what would the hero of that movie do do that joe rogan do you see a full length film about you sitting in the closet and getting high all the time or would it be about overcoming struggles providing selflessly for those around you and striving for personal growth each day be stern on self kind and compassionate to others wes watson dont become complacent once you make progress. remember why you quit and refer to this often. ————————————————————— i went on a 60 day bender after getting to 134 days clean. that just one more time immediately evolved into a daily habit. immediately ive smoked daily for about 7 years now and its time to get my act together. honestly this go around has been much harder for me. im having a much more intense withdrawal this go around. im nearing the end of day 4 and i am feeling slightly better but the first few days were hard. its doable though remember why your part of this sub. its time to use this time in my life to get disciplined and go after my goals in life. its never too late for that. tldr a collection of quotes and notes on why i need to quit smoking. posted as it may resonate with some of you. sorry for the unorganized rant and for any grammarformatting issues. on mobile. 😅 edit wow did not expect this to blow up the way it did. thank you all for the kind words and for sharing your experiencesstories as well. this just shows were all in this together. stay strong folks ✌️❤️😎,joy

you cant get your 20s back hey all i just posted that as a comment and i wanted to share it and my story as inspiration for you all. ive been trying to quit since i was 19. im now 27. i didnt find rleaves until recently but i know people who have quit and i probably havent tried hard enough. im on day 1 as i write this post the last day 1. i wanted you all to know that while i enjoyed my 20s smoking i couldve enjoyed them a lot more if i didnt smoke. less anxiety more relationships more confidence bigger social network less isolation less video gamesjunk food great for saturday nights not all nights better grades better physical shape higher paying job a job i actually enjoy a clean house a nicer place than where i live now. those are what i missed out on because of weed. what did i get in return short periods of being high anxiety chronic smoking affecting work awkwardness and loss of self confidence around womenguys who intimidated me a beer belly excess spending on carry out food because i was too anxious to pick it up myself cross paths with another person an unclean smelly house. dont be like me be stronger. if i could go back 5 years i would take it all back and do it over again sober. do not waste your time like me be strong do not smoke,joy
one year sober down the drain a lesson. i was on this subreddit a lot two years ago when i decided to quit weed. my goal was to get to a year sober. and i fucking made it. i was so proud. i made it a year and a half even before i decided to try some edibles while i was in colorado over christmas break. it was fine. it was pretty nice actually. i brought the rest of the package home. i used occasionally and it was not a problem. it was pretty enjoyable actually. a couple months later i moved in to an apartment with my girlfriend. i had said that i would try smoking again when we had our own place. we were staying at my moms house for a few months before that. we got the place and ive never been so happy. we went and bought some bud legal state and celebrated. it was pretty nice. but it started to get out of hand really quickly. all the willpower i had built up from quitting two years ago went down the drain and i started using every day after work and eventually even during the day sometimes and before work. my point is that i do not know if i can ever go back or do this in moderation. i thought i could but i quickly went back to old habits. i loved being sober. i built my dreams. the things i do and have today exist because of my sobriety. and now i want to get back to that. but it is very hard. im back on day three now of quitting and it sucks. im very irritable. i ca not focus on my work. but anyways here we go again. lets beat this addiction again. 💪 🙏,joy
today i did not get high before work i usually ca not help myself and i have a good job that i need to prove my worth for. happy today i did not have wake n bake for the first time.,joy

4 years later i have no choice but to tell you about the benefits of leaving ill keep this short and sweet. 4 years ago after smoking weed for 8 years in my youth i had panic attacks social anxiety prescription for various mental issues brain fog general instability was known by people as the stoner difficult relationship with my mother now havent had a panic attack in 3 years extremely social and comfortable around people no prescription for mental issues in years feel mentally clear stable person known by the new people in my life as a straight shooter and the one that doesnt do any drugs fantastic relationship with my mom quitting marijuana was the best thing i did for my mental health. to be honest after doing it for so many years in my youth 14 22 i thought i had permanently damaged my brain. i genuinely believed that. i had the visual snow brain fog anxiety absolutely everything. i figured it was permanent but if i could go back and tell myself to just wait it out i would tell myself that it would fade for me. its funny because i live in a legal state now. younger me would be so incredibly confused why i dont smoke now in a perfectly legal place. but i am happy financially stable and take the good with the bad. because the bad things in my life happened for sure but i was able to healthily deal with it. i hope you are all having a wonderful day. lt3,joy

when im high i want to quit. when i quit i want to be high. its funny because almost every time i smoke i have this feeling like ‘why did i just do that then i sober up and im like ‘when can i do that again its so weird. then i talk to my inner sober self and say ‘why are you always saying i should quit its crazy. to the people around me im so ‘high functioning that they think im silly for trying to quit. they say ‘why you have it all under control. its like your glass of wine at the end of the night but deep down inside i feel like a daily smoker cannot be functioning at their full potential. anyway. long story short. this is why i havent been able to quit fully. when i dont smoke i think im depriving myself from some sort of treat that i am deserving of. and when i do smoke i feel like im depriving myself of a better lifestyle. i only post this here because i see a lot of members saying things like ‘you will quit when you really want to. but sometimes i ask what about those of us who dont ‘want to but maybe should heres to sober october. wow. just went on my lunch break and saw all these comments. thank you everyone for commenting and giving some different perspectives. great community here.,surprise
reminder whatever crappy feeling you have weed wont help but will only add a foggy layer of regret and self loathing. you need to find a way to ride the waves without resorting to destructive habits. stay strong friends.,sadness
a poem that has been a huge help in my sobrietyif it can help me quit hopefully it can help some of you too i walk down the street. there is a deep hole in the sidewalk. i fall in. i am lost i am helpless. it is not my fault. it takes forever to find a way out. i walk down the same street. there is a deep hole in the sidewalk. i pretend i do not see it. i fall in again. i ca not believe i am in the same place. but it is not my fault. it still takes me a long time to get out. i walk down the same street. there is a deep hole in the sidewalk. i see it is there. i still fall in. its a habit. my eyes are open. i know where i am. it is my fault. i get out immediately. i walk down the same street. there is a deep hole in the sidewalk. i walk around it. i walk down another street. after 10 years of daily smoking in order to cope with ptsd after an abusive relationship this poem woke me up. any time i have even the slightest craving i mutter the final line to myself and feel empoweredi walk down another street,joy
3 months clean from all drugs and alcohol today and 200 days clean from pot hey guys todays a very special day for me because well read the title ive been clean from pot for so long at this point that i am comfortable recalling past memories of using it without having any urge or desire to use it again. i think for some people marijuana can be a useful creative and introspective tool but where i stand the entity behind mary jane and i do not get along. i still respect her as she is a beautiful plant. but i become sick when i use her i have an intolerance to her or in other words im allergic to her. of course as an addict i really am allergic to all drugs but mary jane is my drug of choice and while i saw some very beautiful and very pleasureable things while under her gaze this is the exact reason why the substance is dangerous for me. i want to give a shoutout to any other recovering stoners trying to get sober and let you know that it is possible im only 200 days in from all substances and im already feeling better than i ever have. just take it one day at a time thanks guys,joy
best part about quitting is having dreams again if you did not know weed suppresses your rem sleep which is responsible for producing dreams and its so enjoyable to have them back again. sometimes theyre wacky but i seen some titties in mine last night so im pretty happy with it lol,joy
vacation on weed vs vacation wo weed i am on vacation with my wife right now. normally i would be stressing about how to bring weed get it on the flight and enjoy it while im there so i could feel chill. well let me tell you this has been the first vacation i have taken without weed. i am now 35 days sober my friends brought weed but i have resisted and stayed away. and i have felt the most chill that i have ever felt. i am not chasing a feeling i just feel it i dont need to smoke to be chill i am just chill. watching my friends smoke weed now is different i feel their pain they are looking to numb with weed i see they are chasing the same things i chased for years. what you chase with drugs you will never catch. it is like the chestier rabbit in alice and wonderland. when you accept yourself who you are why you are. life becomes less of a chase and more of an existence. we all exist that is the common experience. embrace it and enjoy the fine moments and you will truly live. god bless everyone in this sub.,sadness
what it really does to me it makes me socially awkward. it makes me forget important dates. it makes me forget about my friends and family. it makes me dull. it lets me enjoy experiences but then forget about that enjoyment. it steals my dreams. it sabotages my relationships. it empties my bank account. it makes me eat more than i should. it makes me spend money on things that i shouldnt. it damages my lungs. it makes me use it when i dont want to. it prevents me from getting important things done. it sticks around the next morning and keeps me in a daze. it eliminates my passion for things. it causes me to waste hours on meaningless activities. it makes me smell bad. it isnt discreet even though i tell myself that people dont know they know. it makes me bail out on my friends. it doesnt let me sleep if i use it and then stop using it. it holds my appetite hostage if i use and then stop using. it makes me ok with doing nothing. it makes me ok with accomplishing nothing. it makes me paranoid about drug tests. it prevents me from exercising. it makes me think im creative but it prevents me from acting on those creative thoughts. it starts to become the only thing i want to do. it starts to control me. it makes me fall into a repetitious cycle of laziness and sloth. it stops me from growing as a person. it prevents me from seeking out new experiences. it takes time away from the hobbies and activities that i truly enjoy. it prevents me from being me. it gets boring. it fails to live up to my expectations but keeps me coming back anyway. it doesnt rule me anymore. it isnt for me anymore. im in control now.,sadness
i turned 30 today and im 28 days clean from weed. longest streak for me in 11 years and im looking forward to a healthy optimal weed free life. thank you guys for the support,joy
dont forget how serious this is youre getting high on a drug every single day and never really sober. youre wasting precious years in a hazy cloud blindly seeking pleasure while avoiding responsibilities and personal growth. youre living a half life dependent on an external substance to feel happiness and maintain a stable mental and physical state. the situation is a 1010 weed helps you escape from reality and numbs you to your problems. had a horribly long and stressful day at work dont worry a couple bowls later youll be feeling dandy. had a major fight with someone close to you and feeling shaken up smoke a half gram and youll forget all about it in no time. that numbing effect is perhaps one of marijuanas most desirable qualities. however that same effect also numbs you to the fact that youre an addict and youve lost control. it numbs you to the fact your life is going downhill. that your relationships are suffering. that your memory is deteriorating. that your vitality is fading. that you havent been your true self in years. that the path youre on is dark one with the bitterest of ends. smoke if you want to. tell yourself things arent that bad. that quitting can wait and youll get to it when your ready. just remember though. youre under its spell. and i assure you the situation is a 1010,joy
quit smoking 5 years ago. you might think its a never ending struggle but its not. i thought weed was going to be a part of my life forever. when i quit i thought the struggle of not relapsing would be part of my life forever. i was wrong in both cases. it takes time but the struggle gets easier and eventually there is no struggle. right now its as if i never even tried it once. i can hardly remember the high anymore. i can hardly remember the urge. i ca not remember the anxiety of smoking and not smoking. its all history.,sadness

smoked today after 6 months sober and can confirm we are not missing anything. i am approaching the end of my first semester of nursing school and i have been thinking i was missing weed latelyalthough i see now i was just being nostalgic about the act of it. so i have about a month or so before my next semester and figured if i am going to smoke it should be now while i am out of school also they random test at my school because we are in the hospital. today i smoked and it was blah. i zoned out my conversations were dull. i felt genuinely apathetic about most things that crossed my mind. i noticed my heart rate increased and i actually felt less relaxed. i did not really enjoy eating which i expected to be enjoyable. i felt a bit dizzy and frustrated that i chose to smoke. however this has been a lesson for me in my journey. weed still sucks the life out of me. it is not cool or fun it drains me of my personality. im better off without it in my life. so if any of you out there are helped by reading this that warms my heart. tomorrow will be better for me and smoke free. edit just want to say thank you to all of the members of this community who took the time to read and reply to me here. i did read every comment even if i did not reply. i appreciate all of you supporting each other and making this group what it is. also this is easily my biggest post ever so thanks for that record too,sadness
one whole year since i posted about quitting. what its like now. today marks one whole year since i posted about my first day here. what i have noticed in one year one year ago i posted this. i had my first na meeting and was going clean. its been one year free of pot and alcohol. i was a daily smoker. loved it. never an excuse not to smoke. i took a year off from my high stress job and filled my days with clouds of smoke. the first few weeks and months were the hardest because you have to get used to living your life without that crutch. i used to work my ass off knowing i would have that smoke at the end of the night. nothing beat that feeling of taking my joint on the deck lighting up and melting. the first week was restlessness and anhedonia. i waited everyday until it was early enough to go to bed and then stared at the wall. it felt like wearing an itchy wool sweater. thats how uncomfortable wearing my own skin was. i couldnt imagine not smoking with every activity. softball snowboardingrunning. i couldnt imagine not having that with a smoke for the rest of my life. it was scary thinking of how will i do that. i carried around a just for today keychain in my hand as a security blanket for the first month. i joined a lawyers support group and that really helped as i went through the 12 steps. now im so much happier. i used to think weed helped me with anxiety. the opposite is true. weed creates the very anxiety it cures. since quitting my mood is way more balanced and my mental well being has improved dramatically. my job is litigation so its stressful. whats different is that i can manage it without going off the deep end. im way more active and present in my relationships with my friends and family. i no longer retreat and ignore calls when im high. im actually there and it feels good. my social anxiety is far lower. i really got into snowboarding and nailed 17 days on the hill mostly by myself getting my ass up at 500 for fresh tracks. it was hard because i always used to smoked a joint on the lift. sometimes i still miss it. i would never have been able to do this while high all the time. what i noticed about my getting high before is that the most enjoyable part is the full joint the light and the first puff. that was the best part. actually being highmuch less fun. my journal from the year before i quit had so many entries of me saying you dont even like when you get high my favourite part is the feeling of being free from the cycle of smoke high anxiety smoke high. my life used to revolve around that next joint. the next activity was planned around when that next joint was. im free of that cycle. i have energy for meaningful hobbies. there are some smoker friends i dont see as much anymore. my decision to get sober cost me the love of my life. he is a heavy drinker and when i got sober it was a change our relationship couldnt handle. he is a wonderful successful person with many talents but as a sober person being with someone who drinks a bottle and a half of wine a night and loves to party is not the right fit for me. it makes me sad that i no longer see the relationship for what it once was but now that i see it for what it is i cant unsee it. people ask me if i will ever go back to having a smoke once in a while. the answer is no. i dont have control over my consumption. one is too many a thousand is never enough. if i have oneill rationalize once in a while and then from there to once a week and then once a night and ill be back to regular habits. ive run my relationship with marijuana into the ground. the best thing i learned in meetings is that if you have to work at controlling or monitoring your consumption your already past that point of having control. i made the decision to quit alcohol as well. i was never a solo drinker but i didnt want to get out of one trap to fall into another. quitting alcohol was harder socially because drinking is everywhere especially in law. after a while people just stopped asking me if i wanted a drink. when i go to events i have diet coke in a wine glass. i certainly feel uncomfortable when im the only one it drinking at a heavy drinking event but my discomfort wont be solved by consuming ethanol products. it will be solved by being ok with being me. still working on it. the only one who really gives a shit is me. no one else is really that interested with their own lives to care. this post got quite rambley. however just over a year ago i stumbled here out of curiosity if my consumption was problematic or not. i kept coming back and reading and the more i read the stories of people here the more it started to click that something in my life wasnt right. thank you rleaves. to those who lurk late at night reading and thinking if this applies to them keep reading and talking. the rest will come.,joy

i said no last night i was at my boyfriends house and as they all smoke and i had decided to quit i knew this was a risk but they are very sweet and i didnt want to mention it. so after dinner i go upstairs and his family is hitting their little vape thing. this brought me for a ride as i sat there and watched them not wanting to be rude. his dad offers it to me and i said no thank you impulsively because i knew that was my new answer. and then i realized what had just happened. for the first time in 5 years i said no to the thing i have never said no to before. i know i dont deserve a gold metal or anything but i was really proud and i went to the bathroom and started ugly sobbing because i could not believe what just happened. just wanted to share still a bit in disbelief honestly but it was bittersweet and then just amazing. best high ive gotten in years is knowing im getting better. edit the support on this post has been overwhelmingly amazing. thank you all so much for your kind words. this subreddit keeps me going also thank you so much for the awards ❤️ all the love edit 2 has been an insane journey and i cant tell you all how my times i cried looking at this post and looking at the responses. you are all amazing people thank you for the support and the freaking gold oh my god😭😭😭,joy
after quiting i realized the reason why every single one of my friends smoke every friend that i know who smokes each has a sad reason behind it. when we were all smoking together you do not think about this youre simply having fun feeling great when youre high. after i stopped i quickly realized each one my friend has a traumatic reason behind their addiction i did as well and im glad im on the path to recovery. its just sad knowing deep down your friends are not doing well and are actually hurt even if they do not show it. childhood friends who you used to hang out sober with more than half of your lives as kids are now in this sad position in their lives facing this terrible addiction. i hope they soon realize they also have the power to take control of their lives.,joy
when i smoke all i think about is wanting to quit and when im not high all i think about is wanting to smoke,joy
35 yrs of being stoned everyday. hi everyone im 49yrs old next month and have smoked weed everyday since 14 yrs old. in that time ive had no more than 10 days off mostly for health reasons. i dont know myself only the stoned me. i suffer anxiety and depression and have good reason but im finally admitting to myself that weed isnt helping and most probably contributing to my illness. i want to stop im going to stop . for the last 5 days ive smoked just 2 tokes on a pipe right before sleep i dont miss it but cant sleep unless i have that toke. im going to start going to the gym tomorrow evening to help get me tired. cannabis is such a big part of me that even the thought of not smoking is alien to me. has anyone else had a long term habit addiction and quit and if so any words to quieten this pot heads crazy racing mind. big love and respect to all those out there facing this ordeal. andy.,fear
from a daily wake and bake stoner to 6 weeks clean heres what ive learned so i had been smoking weed semi regularly for 4 years and daily wake and bake smoking for 2 and half. the effects it was having on my health both physical and mental my personal life and my career were really starting to show. i had attempted quitting and moderating several times before but id never been able to make it stick. about 6 weeks ago my boss told me that if my performance didnt improve at work he would have to put me on a performance management plan. which where i live is basically the first step for firing someone for poor performance. i work in sales for a tech company thats on a rocket ship trajectory. i have a very small amount of stock in the company so this job could be my ticket to setting up a really good life for myself so having that meeting was a real wake up call for me. traditionally on my past quitting attempts i had thrown out my weed my paraphernalia and deleted my dealers number. inevitably i would have a panic attack and put myself through the indignity of rummaging through the trash to grab my bong back or waste money on a brand new one and get my dealers number back from someone and go into an even worse binge. this time i kept my bong exactly where it always sits i still have my lighter grinder and everything else with me i still have my dealers number. for me personally there was something about the psychology of i can smoke if i want to but im choosing not to that really worked for me. in addition to that i had seen some advice to not think of quitting as im quitting weed forever but just to wake up every day and say not today im not smoking today that also was really successful for me. initially i only intended on going on a break but having noticed how much my sleep my work performance my social life as much as you can have one in a covid world and everything else had improved that now i think ive given up weed for good. there is a lot of advice out there for quitting weed dont be afraid to try different techniques and strategies even if they might not be what the majority considers the right approach. tldr i tried and failed to quit a number of times before by following the traditional quitting advice but then i switched it up kept all my weed stuff and adopted a one day at a time not today mentality rather than im quitting for the rest of my life that was really successful for me,joy
just smoked after 2 months sober. what i learned thought about relapsing lately your brain convincing you one time wont hurtyou can moderateanything of that sort lucky for you i smoked last night after two months and can tell you all about it so you dont have to. prior to the evening when i smoked i was browsing this subreddit feverishly looking up relapse to see what peoples experiences were and ultimately trying to convince myself it wouldnt be so bad that i could be different etc. i ended up being so sure that smoking one time wouldnt completely derail me. i didnt want to believe peoples accounts of relapsing and having anxiety binge eating and feeling shitty the following day. surprise it happened to me. what happened when i smoked it felt great. at least for the first hour. i got really high and i wont lie i was enjoying myself. but following the first hour was when it went downhill. i started to feel beyond groggy and slightly anxious. i felt so incapacitated. i noticed some of the old negatives that happened when i used to smoke daily clenching my jaw overall bodily discomfort and feeling overwhelmed. i proceeded to eat half a party sized bag of salt and vinegar chips. yikes. i ended up needing to go to bed because the weed made me so exhausted. cue this morning woke up feeling like a foggy piece of shit. i think i woke up reanimated into an actual zombie. worst of all my cravings came back with a vengeance stronger than when i was on my sober streak. currently im feeling some pretty bad cravings that most likely wouldnt have been as strong if i didnt smoke last night. my brain is also continuing to convince me i can moderate. moral of the story dont relapse. i know it sounds simple but i can promise you it isnt worth it. peoples relapse stories on here are not just them being overly cautious or exaggerating the symptoms. stay strong and avoid the temptation itll be better in the long run i promise. stay strong everyone youve got this back to day 1.,sadness
what weed did for me it lowered every bar. now that i have some time behind me i realize that what i liked about smoking is what actually did the most damage to me in the long term t lowered every bar. it lowered the bar for fun it lowered the bar for friends it lowered the bar for food it lowered the bar for dating it lowered the bar for funny it will take any shitty person place or thing and make it feel like a steak dinner. but it was not a steak dinner i was just living a shitty life and taking a drug to make me okay with it. now my life is getting better and getting better for real. im not sure because its an unfamiliar feeling but i think i might actually be happy every once in awhile.,sadness
we must all suffer from one of two pains the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. the difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons. i just wanted to share a quote thats really helping me stick to my goal of quitting im not usually one for quotes but this really resonated with me. ive smoked ten years and i know if i keep going ill seriously regret it later in life and the fear of that regret is really helping me stay disciplined. hopefully it can help you guys too,sadness
weed is a trap weed wo not kill you but it will kill who you could be. its easy to forget that emotions we become some numb to are feedback. they tell us when we are uncomfortable and they push us to overcome whatever situation we are in. weed makes us comfortable with being uncomfortable. that shit job you are stuck in do not worry about it. you can smoke and chill out right after your shift is done.that huge test you are studying for youre really stressed out. maybe a little toke will make you more focused. all weed really does is freeze you in time. the world will keep spinning and your peers will progress through life while you live the same day in a smoke filled haze. is not it better to feel emotions is not it better to cherish the boredom you feel that motivates you to pick up a guitar go to the gym or otherwise be productive think about all you couldve accomplished if so much time and money were not spent on a disassociating from the real you. weed is the most dangerous drug in the world because of how safe it is. it takes the potential of all that you could ever be and makes you content with what you are. its sad to think ive felt much more human and alive these past few weeks than i have these past few years of daily smoking. im angry that ive let myself be okay with a mediocre life but im putting everything i can into changing that. stay off the weed if you fall off the wagon get right back on it. theres much more to life than getting high,joy
how my eyes have changed since quitting ive always found progress pics really motivational and i was looking for a way to include that in my quit so i took photos of my eyes. to me theres something almost eerily different about them now between day 2 and day 42. theres the obvious parts the skin around them is less purple and sunken the whites are much whiter theyve lost that permanent glossy haze. but theres just something else that really made me want to share. my eyes on day 2 vs. day 42 ive never felt more proud of myself than i have looking at this picture. it sounds lame but it almost looks like theres more soul in them. maybe its just me seeing it knowing how much of myself ive gotten back. maybe its the lighting. maybe theres some science behind it. maybe its just hope. whatever it is i know i made the right choice and ill keep making that choice every day. edit the top photo is a tad less focused than the bottom but i still see huge differences. for anyone wanting to do their own eyeball progress pics definitely double check that its focused right on the iris edit 2 thanks so much for the silver and the kind comments and as another disclaimer i know these pictutes are not exact. i did everything i could but there are differences in the lighting and sharpness. i saw the biggest difference in how it felt to make eye contact with each. the top picture is of a dead eyed stoner. the bottom picture is of me.,joy
my grandpa on how he quit smoking well i want to smoke. if i smoke i will want to smoke again in 20 minutes. if i dont smoke then in about 20 minutes i will still want to smoke. so why would i smoke if the end result is the same,anger
this single idea changed my whole mindset on marijuana and helped me quit for good. when trying to quit i had such a negative connotation on weed. i thought it was the biggest issue in my life. if i solved this issue everything would be okay. i was in a constant loop of relapsing for 2 years straight. i hated marijuana yet i kept using daily. i finally discovered that weed wasnt my problem. it was my solution. i used this compound to try and solve the other problems in my life. but weed doesnt solve anything it just numbs the pain. once i changed my perspective something clicked in my head. weed wasnt ruining my life. i was ruining my life. maybe there are more people who need to hear this weed isnt your problem. its your solution. once i found alternative solutions to my actual problems i was able to quit.,anger
yknow whats so great about being sober you can just do whatever tf you want man i cannot tell you how many times ive had to skirt around making plans cancel plans or just never do anything because it would take several days to figure out how to time getting high enough to do stuff with being not so high that i could not do stuff but also not so sober i did not wanna do anything and only for as long as that small window of time between them or else id be stuck out needing to get high or getting high and being too high to keep doing the thing. such a shitty cycle that just kept me basically stuck in my room and made my whole world so unbelievably small. but im sober now. i spontaneously caught up with an old friend the other day it was great. i spoke to another friend i have not seen for a while and i was able to genuinely say let me know when youre free and well catch up and mean it. bought a nice new bike on a whim and actually ride it whenever i feel like. i chilled out with my housemate and his friend tonight just casually. i enquired about a tattoo booking now the studios are opening back up and i was able to take the appointment offered to me without having to think about it. the next day one of my besties is coming around with her daughter and new bf for lunch at my place and im actually excited about it not trying to tetris in being able to even do it and dreading interactions with some guy i do not know and a teenager. then i lined up a date with a really cool seeming guy for lunchtime the next day at a café i like in town. thats a whole weekend line up just like a normal person just living life. have not been able to just do shit like that for so long its honestly like oh thats something other people get to do not me. but screw that i do get to hang out with with mates and make appointments and go on dates and eat at cafés and buy myself nice things and live my goddamn life. weed was like a prison. a warm heavy comfortable prison. im glad to be out of prison finally.,joy
i get it now. i did not smoke weed this weekend. time moved slower. i tried a new restaurant. i painted on my back porch. i went for a run. i ate a normal amount of food. i woke up feeling rested. i walked through my neighborhood. i called my grandma. i meal prepped for the week. i actually watched a movie. i checked in with some friends. i finished a ton errands before 10am. i had an actual dream. part of me missed the high. craved it. regardless this is pretty cool. i get it now.,joy
saw this on my buddys flash sheet and had to have it. heres to never being a stoner again. rip to lesser days.,anger
hello all its my birthday this is my 3rd birthday that i will be sober.🎉🎂🎈🎈,joy
have not smoked in a week and the change was immediate 20f let me start by saying that i believe marijuana is a transformative plant smoking it can bring out the best in a person or it can bring out the worst and sometimes it flips. sometimes it can bring you a great burst of creativity other times youre locked in your room shaking under your sheets. i started smoking socially and at first what a world weed made everything better. it was something to do with my friends when we went hiking or to the beach or to watch a movie. weed was a welcome accompaniment to any and all activities hell sometimes that was the only activity we would just sit around smoke and shoot the shit. it was a great conversation starter as just about everyone smokes nowadays. smoking weed was a way to escape from my thoughts and enjoy everything around me. but at some point over the last 2 years that changed. my first semester of college is where things took a nose dive. i was 18 a fresh lil baby who had never been away from home for more than a month and i fell into the wrong crowd almost immediately. at first we would take all sorts of precautions like using a smoke buddy blowing out the window etc until we were smoking big ass blunts in the bathroom without covering the vents. all we would do was toke and i would go to class reeking to high heaven not retaining a single thing. eventually it got to the point that we all stopped going to class because it interfered with us getting high. the apartment that we all lived at some rent free became sticky like the ground was covered in tar. leaving was not exactly terrifying but it was really unpleasant. anytime i did leave all i could think about was getting back as soon as possible to smoke with my friends. i did not want to no i could not leave because what if i missed out on something what if t did something hilarious or a great conversation happened and i was not there to add my brainless contribution even worse what if they were talking shit about me and where was i at the dining halls or in class nothing was more important than being there every minute everyday not personal time to recenter myself not class certainly not food. i may be one of the few folks who got the reverse freshman 15. after further bad experiences winter break that i wo not go into i finally went home and realized that i was too immature for it all. being on your own required a level of strength that i did not yet have even if the university is holding your hand on the journey to independence. i pulled out of the main campus and enrolled in the regional campuses commuting from home i was going to classes and doing well for myself safe back in the nest. but i was still smoking. i had to smoke to do anything. cleaning my cats litter box better spark up first. going to work just a little hit. what a day i just want to smoke and pass out in front of how i met your mother or love after lock up or any other mindless sitcom that would allow me to consume consume consume no thoughts required. i binged so much reality television that my speech patterns would mimic whatever stupid show i was watching at the time. my social skills went down the toilet because i was always high i started stuttering my brain would hitch my term for not being able to think properly my anxiety sky rocketed as my depression spiraled. instead of getting out of my head weed forced me in deeper at gun point. i would be nearly comatose on my bed with a head that felt like it was full of wasps. i am an incredibly visual person and weed would bring me 4k hd visions crystal fucking clear of past humiliations of future possibilities that would always veer towards negativity of my present pimply yellow toothed self because of all of the shit food i would eat and how my skin and teeth reacts to smoke. but despite every negative effect it gave me despite how it cemented me and made me stagnate i could not stop. something about the brain buzz that i both loved and feared. but one day high as usual i went into the bathroom to look at myself. the familiar rush of self loathing filled me but there was something else this time. it was the strongest desire to change everything about me including the environment surrounding me. more than anything i wanted to be the best version of myself living far far away. away from my childhood room and the rut i stuck myself in being independent living my best life and most importantly not dependent on a substance to get me through the day a substance that was inexplicably tied to the trauma i had endured 2 years ago and was reliving every time i picked up the bong. i wish i could say that then was when i stopped smoking i continued to use for weeks after this epiphany but i made a goal i would move out by the beginning of august and no matter what i would never smoke weed at my new place. its been a week since i moved in and i kept my word and the change was instantaneous. my brain fog cleared up i no longer stutter or struggle as hard finding the right words my anxiety is considerably lower im very social with my roommates and though i still feel sad its not the intense waves of depression that almost drowned me. my teeth have even lightened a few shades and my acne is calming down. with this change of habit some new habits have formed as well. im cooking instead of eating fast food keeping up with my hygiene i make it a point to be more neat and organized. the only change that i still need to make is implementing a work out routine and being less sedentary but despite it all im working everyday to be the best version of myself. about damn time.,sadness
you guys said it would get easier it did. everyone is this community says to keep holding on. i trusted you. and it did get easier. thank you,joy
four days in and my gf said she sees the man she fell in love with again. some context for my journey. i gave up weed eight years ago and after a fairly traumatic breakup earlier in the year i began smoking again. during that time i met an amazing woman and the first three months of our relationship were carefree and fun but the past little bit ive let myself fall down the rabbit hole of smoking almost an ounce a fortnight. its made me anxious jealous and i havent performed professionally. i had to recognise the impact and give myself space again. i now realise i sadly cant have a casual relationship with weed and i need to stop. so instead of spending my money on an ounce i took my gf for dinner at a fancy italian place and we laughed more than we have for a long time and enjoyed a bottle of red wine. i feel more in control of my emotions and decisions than i have in months and i cant think of a life in which weed plays a role. im proud of myself and so motivated that this time it will stick no matter what life throws at me. im posting here to keep myself accountable and make sure i stick to it because this is my true self not the lie weed told me i was.,joy

i tried to kill myself last night i made a throwaway account to share my feelings cause im ashamed of myself. i smoked weed for 10 years each day about 1 1.5gr a day. tried to stop several times but it got me in its control. i feel like i am in prison trapped in my own body to stand up each day and smoke and do nothing. watching myself in the mirror everyday seeing myself getting worse everyday. last night i just wanted to give up. i went outside and didnt take anything with me. drove to the nearest high bridge and i stood there on the edge for maybe 30 minutes before someone stopped and pulled me away. i couldnt stop crying for 4 hours and my life is so miserable. lost both of my parents when i was 5 no brothers or sisters and i got 0 friends. i havehad a wife and a 2 yo daughter and i cant even look them in the eyes without losing my mind and crying. what am i doing to myself i lost everything. its not worth it anymore. i dont know how i can ever stop this. i didnt smoke untill what happened yesterday and i truly believe that stop smoking will help and will do less damage than continuing smoking.,sadness
weed free for 100 days decided to smoke again. what i have learned. i was free from weed for a 100 days before i decided to try it out again. bought a gram and spent 2 3 days smoking it. im out now and what i have noticed is that i am craving it again. i was craving it as well while i was quitting but comparing that crave to the current one this one is way harder. i thought the cravings i was having after a 100 days were tough but in reality they were easy. i definitely do feel better when i lay off the weed so i am taking this as a lesson learned and whenever i feel the need to smoke again i will remember that fighting the urge after being off of it for a while is easier than just doing it one time and then fighting off that crave. thanks for reading.,joy

i have 600 days sober today i cannot believe it. i know its not an actual anniversary but its still a hell of a long time haha. weed the figurative handcuffs i wore that kept me chained to my bed eating delivered food in my pajamas while dirty dishes rotted in my sink while worn clothes piled up on my floor while my bank account dwindled while my missed calls and emails accumulated while my self esteem deteriorated while my hobbies disappeared while my social plans were cancelled while my friends were getting promotions and boyfriends while i stayed stagnant while i lost motivation while my self hatred grew. the list could go on. weed had such a hold on my life. what started out as a fun thing to do with friends became the one thing that kept me so miserable and isolated. i am so so so grateful to experience what life can feel like without the prison of weed. ive said this before and ill say it again weed was the abusive best friend who became my worst enemy.,anger
weed makes pleasure too simple. being able to smoke and immediately get pleasure ultimately fucks your brains reward system. you need to get pleasure from complex events in your life rather than smoking a plant. i felt disassociated from everything around me when i was smoking every day. now i see why. my brain didnt need to be in touch with events around me to have a good time. this is short term happiness that gets old eventually. sustained happiness can not be that simple. appreciate whats around you. quitting is going to be fucking rough. this hardship doesnt mean your mind is ruined by any means. your mind needs time to adapt without daily weed and to learn how to reward you accordingly. let your mind get used to getting high on your own life and the events that are happening to you. soon enough youll feel better than you can ever remember feeling.,joy

high me vs sober me high me wakes up tired after 8 hours of sleep. sober me wakes up well rested after 7 hours of sleep. high me stops at mcdonalds before work to get a quick breakfast. sober me prepares a healthy sandwich and fruit to take for breakfast. high me hates his job and counts every minute until he can go home and smoke. sober me feels fulfilled and competent during work and is engaged in his goals. high me gets home with more fast food to eat after getting high. sober me gets home and goes on a run then makes a healthy plate of chicken rice and vegetables. high me goes straight on the computer to play games with toxic communities. sober me practices guitar and tries to master that song thats been bugging him. high me goes to sleep wondering when life will get better. sober me goes to sleep planning the next day and what he needs to do to make his life better. i dont know about you but i wouldnt trade sober me for the world. my friends wake up you dont hate your friends you dont hate your job you dont hate yourself you dont hate your life you only hate the mindset youre in everyday because you continue to use thc. stay strong and stay positive sober you is waiting edit hello everyone id like to address something for a select few people who have a different opinion than i. this subreddit is about addiction its for people like myself who have finally come to terms that they cannot use thc moderately responsibly casually healthily however youd like to put it. it affects us negatively its hurt us or held us back in one way or another. im not trying to say that the plant itself has no benefits i actually believe in the benefits of cbd but thats a whole different story for a whole different subreddit. my opinion thc and i are not compatible i cant form a healthy relationship with it and i feel like a better version of myself without it. if you can live a healthy lifestyle and still use thc in moderation or you feel it helps you become more creative in your own right then this postsubreddit may not be for you. thank you for sharing your opinion and im glad thc hasnt had the effect its had on me and many others here.,joy
i used to be like damn how does everyone find time to clean their apartment and have energy to take care of all of their normal adult things and then i stopped smoking weed 😆 what a game changer 24 days in. some days have been rough but overall i cant get over how much better i feel. ive accomplished more in the past 24 days than i have in like the past 5 years. im so excited to hit my one month mark and for the record i started smoking when i was 13 daily since i was 23 and im 30. you can definitely do this and you will feel better keep on keepin on leaves,joy
smoked a joint yesterday after 5 months i wanted to share my experience smoking yesterday. because it was not at all how i expected it to be. first a little back story been completely clean for 5 months having amazing days and terrible ones. i guess how the life of a human being should be. initially it was tough the first 2 weeks i craved all the fucking time. read a lot of good tips here and i think as many of you i now had to meet my problems head on instead of smoking them away. once that initial period was over i felt amazing. i did so many good things for myself like eating healthy exercising meditating got my sleep schedule back on track etc. applied for a masters program trying to move my life forward. as time went by the effect of these good actions diminished or atleast it felt like it. objectively the value they carry did not ofc. exercising is just as good if not better for you when you feel shit as when you feel great. but over time my habits slipped and i went back to behaviour i associate with smoking like binge watching tv youtube sleeping for a long time eating junk. basically a lot of distractions and short term gratification. my problems were not gone and i was tired of fighting. this happened around 3 month mark and just grew in my mind. i saw myself diminish and with these behaviours i once again found myself craving for a smoke. like a lot. i even bought some other herbs non psychoactive to help but all that did was reminding myself of earlier times almost glorifying the days i smoked weed. so yesterday i met up with a friend group i used to smoke a lot with. we started toghetter like 8 years ago and had that habit as an anchor in our friendship. one of them had some weed and rolled one up and sparked it. im actually amazed at how easy i accepted but it didnt seem like the biggest of deals. i think subconsciously i had been waiting for this moment and had already accepted i was gonna smoke. after all i had gone 5 months without and i was craving a lot. just one as a prize for all the hard work right even though i know that life is better without it i had proven that to myself. which of course was the real reward of those 5 months and the joy that accompanied the fact that i made it through. for a time i forgot that pride i had in that accomplishment. to the moral of the story the experience actually turned out great not because it was so great smoking it was not got anxious my mind felt blurred was lethargic etc but because that right there showed me what a fucking waste of my life smoking is. it really solidified the fact that i dont want to smoke there were reasons i quit. it showed me that it was not at all how i fantasized it to be my glorification of it was so off it was hilarious. im not beating myself up over it instead choosing to be grateful for my 5 months and with new spirit regarding the future. i will not smoke. maybe i needed a reminder to continue on my sober journey. thanks to all of you for printing this idea in my mind that 1 slip up does not equal full blown relapse. my progress is not gone all the work i did is still valid. and even though my problems are not gone at least i can say i tried really hard at resolving them and thats what im gonna continue doing. this perspective was lost on me yesterday but i found it again. sorry for the long post i hope someone maybe can relate to some of it and can get something out of my experience. to all the people going strong keep going. let my slip up prove to you that it isnt worth it you dont need to smoke. your reasons for quitting were real and still are. it truly is not worth it. take care of yourself love yourself not a fucking plant. tldr was 5 months sober. smoked a joint. it sucked. got a nice realization out of the experience. motivated to continue on my sober journey. remember the reasons you quit. love yourself never forget that you deserve a happy life without addiction and that its possible. work is required but its really worth it.,joy
i moved in with my flash forward. you know in movies where the main character sees a vision of what his life will be like in the future if he does not clean up his act recently my grandparents died and their house became vacant. still living at home with mum i saw this as a good opportunity to transition into living out of home. id have ultimate freedom i could do whatever i wanted. i could smoke bongs and cigarettes in the house i could order as much take away as i wanted without the fair judgement of my mum. i could have an entire study to work from home in and set up my guitar and my playstation and all of that. there was just one catch my 50 year old uncle. a tall skinny and sickly pale man answered the door and waived with yellow nicotine stamped fingers towards the room id be staying in. the inheritance he received became obvious when he smiled i had never seen him with teeth before and these ones were brand new. track marks polkadotted his arms and id never seen someone be so white and so red at the same time. i walked through my childhood second home for the first time in a while and got to the kitchen before i realised that this was not grandma and grandpas anymore. a white russian milk trail lead from the kitchen bench to the lonely grey ikea couch parked smack in the middle of a too big living room a crease sat on one side of it. 7mate i believe it was pawn stars blared on the tv screen. the huge windows that the sun set into were covered by black blinds so as to maintain total isolation from the neighbours while also extremely effectively trapping the heat in. rings from the bottoms of cups of god knows what patterned the table like an abstract art piece if only said piece was used as one giant plate to chop weed on. a foul smell of rotting meat emanated from a dirty pan i walked into the kitchen. the recycling bin was full to the brim of bottles and flattened cardboard cases that they came in along with maybe 14 uber eats bags. the bin was full of take out food. not old takeout food yesterdays takeout food. full containers. the sink was chock full of shite. this was going to be an easy life. it smelt like 4 days of no showering 6 cigarettes an hour and about 30 years of mental decay. i had not seen my uncle in years. my dad kept him away from us. we caught up finally two adults instead of uncle and nephew. it took one conversation for me to know everything i needed to know about him. you see we were not so different him and i. i liked my me time. so did he. i liked to moan about people and so did he. i liked more than anything to just get high and do my own thing at home and so did he. and thats what we did. i ca not really describe why i always feel so attracted to the idea of being able to smoke inside. its kind of like the ultimate stoner move i do not even have to leave my couch right now. i can get away with maybe 100 steps today. yeah i thought that sounded like a life. so did he. he is without a doubt unquestionably the most pathetic man ive ever met in my entire life. im not even slightly exaggerating. hes smart even funny some times. hes tall hes blonde hes privileged. he had the whole world in his hands when he was about my age. he obviously went to greater extremes than you or i would but in this situation it was not really the journey but the destination. he wakes up smokes a joint drinks himself to sleep by 1pm wakes up does the same thing almost like he has 14 mini days each week. he bitches he moans he blames he complains he mopes he self deprecates he hates himself and he does fucking nothing about it. he sits there and smokes and drinks and smokes and drinks and tells me the same story he told me this morning and the night before and the morning before that as if its the first time hes telling me. he cries. hes unemployed. he stinks. he looks homeless. he had mountains of opportunity and people that loved him. that is what he chose to do with it. he makes little wise cracks daily little snide remarks that make him feel better about his own miserable cry wank of an existence. he subtly talks shit about how my mum never liked him and i never used to like it when she talked badly of him but now i get it because shes right. i moved in here 6 weeks ago extremely excited to finally live freely and do exactly what i wanted when i wanted. im leaving tomorrow three days sober. do not be like my uncle. he fucking sucks. this was a bit of a creative writing outlet for me im struggling to sleep because of withdrawals and my mind is racing but it is all 100 percent true and im sorry if its a bit scattered and the painting im trying to illustrate for you does not come together all that well. i hope you took something from it or at least that i communicated what i was trying to.,love
rleaves is a recommended community woke up one day and realized all of my problems are stemming from weed. i didnt google it or reddit it but i started talking to my friends about it. they were all trying to convince me not to quit for the rest of the day. some had pretty good arguments and i was starting to think weed wasnt the problem. i was about to go smoke with my friends when i got a notification on my phone rleaves is a recommended community. it truly stopped me in my tracks. i was minutes away from smoking. i didnt know what to think was this just a coincidence is this my phone listening to my conversations or is this really a sign being skeptical i opened up the subreddit and the first post i saw addressed my exact situation with my mental health and was just spot on. i havent smoked in a week since then and i think it might be truly over for me. thank you guys.,fear
today we celebrated my moms 68th birthday i didnt smoke before she opened presents. i didnt sit there wishing shed skip the cards so we could be done sooner and i could go smoke or lay in my bed high. i even bought her a present worth 75 the most i have ever spent on a gift for one of my parents. i didnt choose the card that was 2.99 vs 8.99 because i knew id need that extra 6 later to pick up or for gas. i didnt think twice about her hugging me or having to do my ritual of lotion perfume and eye drops before coming downstairs all this is new for me since quitting 66 days ago. i never had money. i never wanted to be around my family for more than 10 minutes. but today i was 100 sober present and truly happy with them as we celebrated my moms 68th year of life she even cried while reading the card i bought her worth the 9 bucks haha i can honestly full heartedly say that quitting is the best decision i have made in years. leave the weed behind. take advantage of the time you have with what and who is important in your life. have a good day everyone edit my first gold woohoo thank you so much guys. this sub has been a huge help in regards to my sobriety. i didnt expect this type of feedback at all. im sooo happy it reached the hearts of so many people. today was a great day. like many of you have said no looking back. blessings to all of you on your journey. good luck,joy
8 years stoned took six months to quit. but its day 50 some of the things that helped its been 50 days since 420. after six months of actively trying to quit and failing daily weekly continuouslyhere we are. i had been smoking daily for about 8 years and had previously been an alcoholic. things that helped me routine plan your day the night before. know what youll do the next day as soon as you wake up. one. day. at. a . time. each day begins with meditation and wim hof breathing. each day ends with some light yogazen time thank yourself for persevering towards sobriety and making yourself a better human. learn about the dopamine system and how your behavior is wired. knowing what is going on in your head may provide answers and then you can implement solutions. get the fk off social media and the news. that garbage is designed to trigger negative emotions and hook you. social media lowers your self worth distracts you from the present and is designed to give you dopamine releases the same system youre currently trying to fix by not smoking. this journey was one i took alone isolated due to covid. maybe that helped because i was not around any old smoke buddies. if you have a good friend or family group stay connected. were deeply wired for human connection. the first 2 3 weeks may have been the most psychologically challenging minutes and days of my lifei was not sure id make it through. hell i was not sure of anything. i was going minute to minute at times. but here at day 50 its hard to describe what life can be like until you break through. all i can say is that not smoking changed me in so many ways all for the better. whoever you are and whatever your story is always believe that you can change. all the love all the power. tldr things that helped me quit routine meditation yoga quit social media learn about dopamine system keep believing in yourself. edit thank you for the gold im not sure what to do with it but its shiny and it was kind of you. edit its been really great chatting with everyone today i was a lurker on here for months and the support we give each other is what will pull us through.,joy
i quit smoking on a wednesday i post this image on my insta every week to track my progress. every line is a week. thanks guys,joy
the only fatty im rolling these days. after 100 days i can breath well again. lungs recover quick after hard efforts. such a good feeling to not be wheezing and struggling to recover.,sadness
took me over 10 years to reach today. almost 1 month,joy
anyone notice how fast your life moves when you smoke everyday once you stop you regain clarity and life moves slower and it feels better in the long run. no more going through the motions.,joy
without weed 1. i can express myself more articulately 2. i automatically improve and take more care in maintaining my physical health and hygiene 3. i have larger and more rewarding goals 4. i learn to experience and regulate my own emotions 5. i have one less thing to be shameful about 6. i have more time in the day 7. i learn to practice discipline and prioritize the long term over the short term 8. i explore 9. i grow to leave behind a tough and rewarding chapter of my life one where i learn how detrimental addiction can be how it can debilitate and warp your thought patterns and finally how to overcome it how to separate my negative thoughts from myself and actively choose to prioritize myself i will not fool myself. i am resilient.,sadness
last night i read a note i wrote myself in 2013 when i was 23. i wrote how i did not want to smoke because it held me back and what i wanted to accomplish after i stop smoking. its 2020 and im 29. 7 years went by just like that. time is the ultimate currency day 9 i have had my ups and downs with weed. mostly downs. ive got through clean periods then relapsed. weed for me just jived with my personality. i like to distance myself and isolate myself so its the perfect solo drug. i have abused it so bad over the last couple of years and it has held me the fuck back. reading that note from 2013 made me so sad. that was 7 fucking years ago. i am dealing with the same issues as 7 years ago. seven motherfucking years i have been feeling so depressed since i quit 9 days ago. i feel like this is it guys i cannot go back. im turning 30 in 2 months. i cannot smoke daily again. it has fucked me and stifled my growth. i am tired of doing this over and over again and posting on this sub over and over and over again. how many times this is it for me. try and think about quitting as a life altering moment. for me i entered a new phase of my life 9 days ago and its that simple. i literally cannot go back. if i do my depression will worsen and im scared i will fall down a black hole and could have irreversible repercussions. its not about weed its about escaping issues and things that are not easy in life. weed is just the vehicle to do it. it could have been alcohol or food or sex or something. not being sober is not a way to live. just think about how much time has been wasted. let that sit for a minute. think about it. think about how much older you have become. think about how the decade of 2010 2020 is done. 10 years just like that. time goes by so quick. its time to take your life more seriously. no one gives a shit about you except you. no one can do anything for you except you.,sadness
16 days in. smoking weed might seem like it is a short activity but in reality it takes away all your free time and leaves you stressed out trying to fit any and all other responsibilities into your schedule. it seems really crazy to me ive made it this far. i really thought it was going to be impossible. i still get cravings im posting right now to distract myself from one but im so much more clearheaded. definitely more productive. starting to remember what boredom and free time feel like. just a little over two weeks ago i would spend every morning before work thinking the same thing ill just smoke one quick bowl then im gonna do the dishes shower and get my school work done and ill still have a few hours left to chill and do whatever i want before work then id watch myself from inside my body in horror as 6 hours passed i was still smoking my bong and i hadnt done anything i needed to or really even anything fun i had wanted to and itd be time to drive high to work. weed takes all my free time. for me theres no such thing as a quick bowl. im still not always happy but i couldnt be happier to be 16 days sober.,joy
earned vs unearned dopamine this is what it seems to boil down to. when i smoke play videogames watch porn etc i did not earn that dopamine. these things ruin me because i get rewarded for doing nothing. eventually my dopamine receptors get numb nothing feels good anymore but i ca not stop doing it. i become weak pathetic nervous unnaturally introverted and reclusive. i enter into a nasty negative feedback loop and it becomes that much harder to do something productive. when im stoned i almost never clean and when i do its the bare minimum to avoid disgust. i never invited anyone over because i was too ashamed and too lazy to clean. when im sober i take pride in cleaning. i listen to music and clean my apartment like im creating art. i want it to look beautiful i feel a sense of accomplishment when i finish i get that dopamine and i feel good about it. my environment is clean because my mind is clean and vice versa. i feel healthy because rather than giving in to the munchies and buying fast food i cook healthy tasty and delicious food which nourishes me. when i discipline myself to earn my pleasure it becomes productive rather than destructive. these are the things that helped me get to where i am now 1. meditation. this helps me with withdrawals and mood swings. it gives me the peace and calm that i used to try to get from weed. it also unlocked some of my dormant power and i felt my consciousness expand. 2. exercise. i needed to burn the excess energy and release endorphins this is especially vital for me early on when im having withdrawals and raging. i choose exercise which i enjoy mma and rock climbing. i do not need discipline to do these things because i enjoy them. i want to take advantage of my youth because one day ill be old. so i want to use my body the way it was designed heal my lungs and feel strong. yoga is also great for me because it checks both exercise and meditation. 3. clean eating. all the sugar and bad fats are a drug in and of themselves. i did not earn that fast food or that sugar hit that just has me feeling awful and anxious afterwards. learning to cook some basic healthy tasty meals was a great investment for me. it helped me with emotional stability and feeling good all the time. 4. clean room. a clean room for me means a clean mind. ive noticed that broke addicted wretched people live in filth. but when im proud of my apartment i feel proud like a king. i want to be clean so that i resonate with my environment. ive learned why they say that cleanliness is next to godliness. 5. social distancing. from the people who encouraged me to remain a loser. i spend more time around people who want the best for me. those who do not like me smoking. i used to have no one but being sober allowed me to get out there and meet people through engaging in some hobbies. being sober also allowed me to find hobbies outside of staying home and gaming. 6. video games. i used to zone out for hours at a time every day losing my self in the digital world. in terms of its effects on the brain video game addiction is not that different to weed addiction imo. there are better things to do with my valuable free time that do not encourage my need for escapism. time lost on games gives me very little if any return on investment. im happier in the long run when im doing more productive things. 7. i read quitting weed the complete guide by matthew clarke. i read a few books like this but they were so cringe i continued to smoke. this one really is the complete guide and it helped program my brain to see my predicament for what it is. 8. sexual discipline. porn i did not earn that woman. masturbation i did not earn that orgasm. undressing a woman with my eyes i did not earn the right to see her naked. lost in a sexual fantasy i never earned the right to have sex with her. if i can keep my mind clean its a lot easier to retain my seed. theres a reason why almost all cultures until recently and religions stress sexual discipline. i believe weve lost sight of that. now i do not know about women but imo for men this might be the single greatest life hack. it has been for me at least. all good habits can follow on from this one. the power and gravitas i develop has me feeling like a super hero and women become very drawn to me. people respect and admire me a lot more when ive been retaining and everything seems to get better. its strange how powerful this practice can be for a lot of the men who try it. i wish you all the best. im here for you anytime if you need support.,joy
i havent smoked in 49 days and im starting to do things i never thought or cared about in years like the simple task of flossing your teeth. my gums were bleeding so bad and inflamed but ive been flossing everyday and theyre starting to get better. keeping up with doing laundry and sanitizing my bathroom and room just maintaining it to keep it clean. in tune to my thoughts and feelings not masking it by getting high all day. pursuing my goals that i never thought twice about doing. going to get trainedcertified to be a pharm tech through this program. i wouldnt have been able to do this had i not quit for good. my overall self and wellbeing. im caring for myself more. im doing things that my future self will thank me for. ive tried quitting in the past but wasnt serious about it. ive had this mental switch that its over with time to grow up be responsible and move the fuck on. im not letting this plant hold me down and its a beautiful thing to be and feel strong this time.,joy
i 26f had previously posted that i couldnt make it through 1 day sober. today i did it 24hrs down the last straw was me falling out multiple times. i take 6 meds for mental disorders and ive irresponsibly disregarded the consequences of mixing with weed. the last few weeks ive been lightheaded when i stand up and have even collapsed a few times. sounds crazy but i loved the feeling of fainting. the complete loss of control of my body and then hitting the ground was euphoric to me. but i realized one day i might not get back up. one day without weed down. never quit quitting edit woah thanks for the shiny • this community is so supportive thanks so much. ive been a longtime lurker but now will definitely be more interactive in here. feel free to pm me.,joy
23 days without it and i already replace that habit for cycling. i do not think smoking mj is a good or bad habit. is just i could not regulate it so the abuse was not helping me to achieve some things that i wanted. i have been reading this subreddit since day 1 and that encourage me to leave it,joy
why am i still here a person dm me and asked me why am i still on this sub. he said youve been clean for over 2 years you shouldnt need as much support as other who are just starting this journey. my response was this. i know how hard it is to to end this habit. i know how difficult it is when youre beginning to go through of remaining clean. i know how stressful it is dealing with withdrawals. why not lend help to others this sub has been supportive to me during my early journey. why not give back also just because i may up the road a bit doesnt mean i cant use the support. i smoked for 25 freaking years. two years clean is a great accomplishment but im still healing im still in recovery. although my paws wave symptoms are spreading further and further apart by the months i still experience them . 25 years a dam long time. weed was my wife my girlfriend my everything. so i understand the struggle. so i say guys continue to get all the support from this sub as you can. support is needed more now than ever. everyone here knows the struggle and can provide the strength to keep you moving ahead. good luck to you all.,joy

day 117 no pot day 201 no wine go me i read that at 10 12 months the benefits of sobriety start compounding. im almost 7 months off the wine and 4 months off the potgummies and 5 13 years off the cigs. the benefits are lining up. i am dreaming next of getting my muscle tone and flexibility back. i am dreaming of focusing hard everyday and working the whole day prospecting and managing my book and then stopping with a guilt free conscious because i did what i promised myself was required to do for success. i want that compounding baby also i have just started listening to my nlp programs again. i was doing that last year and people were telling me that i seemed like a different person. really fabulous attitude and calm and happy. i want more of that. there is no downside people. seize the day time to score in life. fuck the alcohol and cigs and pot. they all suck the life out of people and ruin relationships and cost a fortune. we got this edit wow 442 upvotes. typically i never pay attention. feels good to share the success and cheer you on,joy
day 59 without nicotine day 26 without weed. adapting to good habits like reading books meditating and cooking on a regular basis. life has never been better. thank you all for sharing motivational stories. really helps a lot to keep my game going strong ⭐️,joy
i thought smoking made me a ‘chilled out person. it actually made me irritable anxious and a bit of a dick 6 weeks sober today. i have a lot more patience for things and people in my life. i am now able to open up to them and actually express how i feel about things. this makes me overall happier and a better person to be around. this has improved my relationships with close friends and my parents in particular. smoking clouded my mind and stopped me processing things which would build up inside me until they would blow up one day. clearing that fog has let me identify other problems in my life which i now have the courage to own up to and fix after smoking daily for 15 years. best of luck to everyone else going through the same thing at the moment. the journey so far has been well worth it and i am looking forward to pushing on even further and thanks for all of the support,joy
you may not have had good role models in your life growing up. a lot of us didnt myself included. thats no excuse though to perpetuate those cycles of violence addiction andor disfunction and pass them down to our own children. we can do better for our kids than our parents did for us. i was 8 years old the first time my dad handed me a lit joint. 3rd grade he was drunk as usual. i breathed it in deeply as id seen him do and proceeded to cough my young tender lungs out. he laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world. i remember feeling distinctly embarrassed and ashamed and thinking to myself one day ill be a real man like my dad and be able to hold in that hot smoke. it pains me to think of that and so many other things from my childhood. it pains me to think that my own parents basically saddled my young impressionable self with this decades long addiction to marijuana. our parents are our first and most influential teachers. ive spent the last 20 years trying to unlearn so many unhealthy destructive things i learned in my youth. i did not have much or any personal agency back then. i was a victim of my parents disfunction but i will no longer carry around the burdensome weight of that toxic victimhood mentality. i cannot create a better past for my former child self but i can and have through hard conscious effort along with the help of my wonderful wife of 19 years created a safe loving home for my own children. i am and will continue to be the positive male role model for my kids that i did not have in my youth. i realize that my own parents had a lot of disfunction in their childhood upbringings as well and that allows me to forgive and empathize with them at least to some degree. that cycle stops with me though dammit i will never smoke weed again and ive finally made peace with thisthat shit is so overrated anyway. ps if youre young and thinking that perhaps youd like to create a family of your own one day please think long and hard about what kind of role model you want to be for your future children. this alone may make you question some of the unhealthy hard to break habits youre forming now. thanks for letting me vent and thanks to the creator of this sub for providing a safe space to do so. thanks to all of you as well. your testimonies have been hugely influential and inspirational in my own path of recovery. our mental and physical health is the single most valuable possession we will ever own. lets take an active ownership in our own wellbeing from this day forward. heres to a happy healthy sober life. 16 years without nicotine 11 years sober from alcohol 186 days weed free big love leavers.,sadness
a high functioning addict is still an addict im posting this recent realization here because it got me out of my head. the last few days i was wallowing in self pity because there seem to be a lot of people who are able to smoke and still be motivated. and it just dawned on me that a high functioning addict to weed alcohol does not matter what is still an addict. even if they feel it enriches their life they still have this habit in their life which they have no control over. and ok there are people who can smoke once in a while no problems. but lets be honest im not one of those people 🤷‍♀️. but the person i am is someone who chooses to take control of my life chooses to enrich my life in so much more ways then i was willing to when i was high chooses freedom. i choose freedom.,joy
in a few days i hit the one year mark after a 46 year addiction. yep i did it i could not be prouder and happier. living without weed is great. being an addict really sucks. regrets exist. they sometimes weigh me down. mostly though i am too busy making up for lost time by living my life facing things rather than avoiding them. it baffles me that i used for so long. if youre reading this and you are thinking you have a problem with weed you likely do. give yourself a day off and you may just choose not to go back.,joy
one year free of weed. i am transformed. today is my one year anniversary clean of weed. i can say the benefits of weed free living are so much better than the temporary joy of getting high. i made space to receive lessons and blessings from the universe and i am clear enough to be the master of my reality instead of someone who is consistently out of alignment. i no longer need to seek relief from substance. i can create my own relief. i have learned how to harness my own inherent power and i couldnt describe the impact of that on my life. i faced challenges and traumas and made it my mission to rely on myself for my healing and love. it wasnt easy but my mental state is so solid right now. i am living in pure contentment. dont ever give up on yourself or that dream of being clean. anything you believe is already real and all you desire is already yours.,joy
5 years clean today🎉 so today marks five years clean from weed the best advice i can give is it does get easier i ca not stand being around it now and do not get tempted at all. i used to be going through a good 2 3 grams a day everyday. i struggled pretty bad to not have it. the first year was difficult but after time went on i realised i stopped counting the minuteshoursdays and started forgetting about it. when i could smell it i would get a physical yearning for it and now its a repulsion. this is a big deal for me and im so proud of myself to be where i am today.,love
i am one year sober today. im 34 and this is the longest ive been sober since starting smoking at 16. it is a constant choice to remain sober. i live in a state where its legal and know how easy it would be to stop by a dispensary or call for a delivery. i still crave it and still miss it. but i accept that its no longer a part of my life. in the last year i feel like ive finally grown up. im more comfortable with myself as a person feel less daily anxiety less mood swings. i changed my career got into wicked good shape and donated a kidney to a family member. giving up weed was a sacrifice but the rewards are amazing and worth the daily struggle. i am feeling a lot of quiet pride today. its neat. edit whoever gilded this thanks from the bottom of my soul. today is meaningful.,joy
this drug has too much control over me yesterday i said no more yet today i just ignore. i get high first regret later. i make my points like a good debater i ca not continue i need to stop. better habits i should adopt. but i like the feeling the great escape. i find it hard now to reshape. perhaps tomorrow ill do better. a straight faced lie ive read that letter.,joy
me and a friend making progress quitting,joy
people dont really like weed i know a lot of people love weed. it helps them a lot. but there are a lot of people who think they like it but really dont. they love the feeling of smoking and rolling up and blowing loud but the actual high they hate. when theyre sober they dont realize how much they hate it so they keep doing it. as soon as they get high they realize they hate it so much. do any of yall feel this way,joy

i lost something very important to me while stoned its time to quit as the title says. i am a traveller i love to go backpacking and camping and do so almost every weekend. this last weekend i went camping in a new area so i smoked up and explored like i usually do. it started to get a little late and a thunderstorm was coming so i knew i had to find a place to set up my hammock and tarp except when i got back in my car it would not start. i started to freak out because i was in the middle of nowhere and i know next to nothing about auto mechanics so i packed up my backpack with almost an ounce of weed everything i had in my car my wallet and a bunch of other gear. my plan was to walk until i could find somebody to help but if i got lost along the way i still had weed food and other stuff. and of course the first thing i did before leaving my car was smoke up. well as it turns out i only had to walk about a quarter mile before i flagged down a mountain biker who came with me to my car and quickly knew what was up and fixed it. i was so ecstatic i thanked him got in my car and drove off not knowing i left my backpack on the ground next to my car. i do not know if i ran over it but im sure it got soaked in the thunderstorm. i drove maybe 2 hours out before i realised i left my backpack. i freaked out again and tore down the mountain roads until i got back to my campsite but my backpack was gone. this backpack had been with me to all 7 continents. ive travelled with it for years and years and it became one of my most treasured possessions. so i figured its time. i lost it because i was stoned. it made me realise i am so dumb when im stoned. im a physicist but because of this habit i have been struggling to complete classes and ive been neglecting a lot of tasks for my research group. i have so many more reasons i want to quit but this was the icing on the cake. my resolve feels stronger than any other time ive wanted to quit. i just hope i can stick to it this time.,joy
in who cares news today marks my first full week sober in three years i was daily heavy user. i could not do anything or go anywhere without hitting the pen pipe bong whatever. i never told my family or anyone close to me about my full on addiction. i told myself it was to help my depression but after a while a substance does not help anything. about two weeks ago i got a cold and could not smoke without it irritating my throat. so i drank the vape juice. yes im not kidding. definitely got me high but after three days of doing that i finally took a good look at myself and thought wtf am i doing is this how i want to live my life so i decided enough was enough. keeping myself busy with writing reading skating exercising and whatever else i can think of to keep my mind off weed. sleeping is a bitch and i still feel super foggy like the morning after a smoking bender but im determined to keep sober. i kept all my pens still with juice in them and ready to go because i feel the true way to conquer an addiction is to have the ability to use but stare right at it and say nah im good. today marks a full week thanks for reading this theres no one i could tell whod understand the struggle. heres to week two to anyone who thinks they ca not do it i did not think i could either. you absolutely can.,joy
i smoked weed for the last time on june 17th 2018 one year ago today. one year ago today i smoked weed for the last time. i was miserably depressed hopeless and i could not see a way out. i had tried to stop smoking weed a countless number of times only to forget completely about my goal and start smoking again. for the last month that i was on a bender i smoked weed primarily with guys i met online who i was either using for weed or to feel less lonely. i put myself in countless dangerous and silly situations just to get high. one time i drove two hours to smoke a blunt with some guy who kept trying to pressure me into hooking up with him. i had also broken my ankle two months before that and was still hobbling around very slowly. one time i had to hobble out of a guys house who had made me extremely uncomfortable and i ended up hurting myself even more because i could not get away fast enough. those drives home were filled with desperation shame fear and self loathing. i almost crashed my car multiple times. i had to leave school for a second semester in a row and due to my addiction i felt hopeless that i would ever graduate. the only two people i could find to actually sell me weed were always ripping me off but i needed weed to function so it was either be ripped off andor receive a stemmy bag or hang out with these guys i mentioned prior. i had ruined everything positive in my life my schooling friendships relationships. i lied to and hurt the people who cared about me most and eventually i was all alone. if someone had a problem with my weed smoking i cut them off because they were buzz kills and trying to control me. i spent all my money on weed and all of my time was dedicated to it. everything else was a chore but weed was a given. i kept buying weed and smoking it when i did not want to. i could not even stand to look at myself in the mirror. i looked dead and i hated myself so much. i finally decided to try one more time. i finished my weed on june 17th and i was determined that would be the last time i quit. i had said i would quit so many times so i do not think i really believed that i would stay away from weed. however after midnight i wrote a note to myself in my phone june 18th. just for today. the note on my phone. just for that day i would not smoke. so i did that. again and again and again. i do recovery to keep myself away from weed. i could not quit on my own. i needed help. i have not had to smoke weed since that day and i am so incredibly grateful. im also grateful to rleaves. you guys have saved my butt more times than i can count. i graduated with my bachelors degree a month ago which was only possible because i got sober. i have true friends now who i show up for emotionally as they do for me. the life is back in my eyes. i look at myself in the mirror and i see a wide eyed fierce woman looking back at me. i no longer hang out with people i do not want to. i have stayed single since september because i truly needed to work on myself. i do believe that i will eventually show up for someone and be able to have a meaningful relationship when the time is right. i am finally able to be honest loving and emotionally present. quitting weed did not make everything better but it made me able to make my life better. i no longer set fire to my life while trying to put it out with gasoline. i live a non chaotic life today. today i am at peace and today i will not smoke weed with you all. thank you for being a part of my recovery. one day at a time. 3 sushisavage,sadness

today marks 20 days since ive quit weed alcohol tobacco and replaced coffee with tea twenty days ago i said to myself that i need to make a change if i want to achieve something in my life. i was tired of feeling like shit everyday and showing up high home to my family. the first few days were actually easier than days 10 and all the way to 17. on those days i was really feeling down and had almost zero motivation. im back on the good days right now d. how has quiting cold turkey benefited me i feel and look better no more brainfog and more clarity i do not skip breakfast or other meals i brush my teeth 2 times a day i have more focus and actually get stuff done no hangovers sleeping has improved and im dreaming again regularly i workout much more i also reccomend you start running such an easy exercise to do anywhere and holds so many physical and mental benefits i know i have the power and control to reach my ambitions i do not skip classes i appreciate my life and im grateful for everything i have there is much more these were just the ones on top of my head. quiting is very worth it. you have to be 100 sure you want to quit and know why youre doing this. it will be easier to turn down weed and decrease the chances of relapsing. if you quit with passion it will be much more enjoyable and easier for you. life is too short to waste it.,joy

you dont realize how it affects you until you stop. long time lurker and i usually never post but this sub has really helped me so i thought id share some insight on my experience. its true everything you read here about the negatives with marijuana are true. i think the most dangerous thing about it is that its not dangerous at all not life threatening at least. you cant overdose you can keep goin and goin and without even realizing it youve fallen down a dark path. it takes a strong individual to come to the realization that they need to stop. its one of the reasons i have a deep appreciation for this sub. these are the things ive learned after ive decided to stop using. aside from your appetite and your sleep there are many other factors that weed controls. for me at least i never realized how many feelings i suppress by using. ive always tried to be aware about using when im in a good mood and not as an escape but lets be real we wouldnt be addicted if that was the case. the first week i stopped all the emotions i was suppressing came out all at once when i say all at once i mean it i would be angry one minute then crying the next i would have moments of happiness and motivation then pure self hatred next. my patience for people was at an all time low. luckily i wasnt going out much bc of covid but goddamn when i did i would snap at the most random things. some justifiable some not so much. as a usually calm and level headed person this was strange to me. it took a bit of time to realize that this current person is not who i really am and that years of use may have altered some things within me. i decided to stick it through and acknowledge the fact that my body is adjusting to the changes ive made and boy am i glad i did that its been about a month and almost every aspect of my life has improved. at the end of the day using any type of substance to cope with difficult emotions is unhealthy and i urge everyone to acknowledge their emotions and to try to deal with them head on instead of avoiding them and having them backfire later. once again id like to thank this sub for really opening my eyes and i hope this post helped some people that might be going through what i experienced. lastly id like to say stay strong never stop believing in yourself and dont be afraid to ask your loved ones for help were on this rollercoaster ride together. best regards vj,joy
tutorial how to quit weed and be happy the introduction hello my name is dylan. i have been pouring my heart and soul into this post for the 17 days i have been free of weed. i was able to quit with ease opposed to the many times where i struggled for months only to relapse. i experienced no cravings whatsoever after quitting and hardly noticed the withdrawals. happiness was an inevitable byproduct of this process this fundamental change in attitude. what changed i will get to that later on but i would like to start by giving you some context of where i am coming from. id like to start by saying that weed in and of itself is fine. i still support legalization and recognize that it can be very useful has many medicinal uses and is ultimately fine in moderation like alcohol. the problem is we cannot moderate here we only abuse. i hope to expose the reality of our situation to you ladies and gents – warning it may not be the reality you are expecting. the good news is you are not addicted to weed in the slightest. nope you read that right. you are not addicted to weed. the bad news is that it is a sign of underlying issues in your life. but dont worry i have attempted and hopefully succeeded in creating an actionable plan that can be used to quit weed make it through the withdrawals and live happily ever after if this sounds interesting please read on i know it is long but i have chosen each and every word carefully to convey my message in detail. i wrote this mainly to think through my own struggles with addiction but edited it to share with everyone here. this isnt my real account and couldnt care less about karma so please upvote if this was helpful to you. this community has given me so much support this is the least i could do to repay you guys. enjoy the context i know what you are thinking after reading the title. phh theres no way. i have tried many times and it is never that straightforward. who does this guy think he is. i am one of you. i am a 21 year old college student double majoring in accounting and finance. i am from denver colorado and therefore have access to weed 247. i used to smoke 2 3 grams of weed a day 3 4 spliffs a day 3 4 big dabs minimum and often 10 mokes aka weed and tobacco bong rips. i was a fucking mess. and i knew it but was never able to change. reading the posts on here for a while i know i smoke much more than most of you. not bragging quite the opposite actually. isnt that the worst the guilt of knowing you are sabotaging yourself but not being able to stop i was there for 3 years. i know you may be inclined to dismiss my opinion based on being young not smoking for as long etc. but please read on make that decision at the end of my post. if you still think that call me out in the comments. i dont mind i can take it and potentially clear up some misconceptions. i know my message is valuable hence why i put 25 hours into this post. the addiction so you think you want to quit weed huh i say think because often there is a lot of mixed emotions with this process. sure you know it is fucking with your life. thats why youre here on rleaves. but you also still think you love this plant. you remember the good ol days the joy laughter the connections with like minded individuals revelations and euphoric moments that seemingly could only stem from marijuana. even during the bad times at least mary jane was always there to sooth your emotions and make you feel better right it has always been there for you to the point where it became a big part of your life. we all know that there are alternative ways to get the same high the same rush of dopamine we see examples of these everyday on this sub. hobbies and pastimes that are less expensive more fun healthier etc. we all have surely compiled a list of reasons to quit too. its messing with my sleep or think of the money i could save. but it never seems to work right you have always known you need to quit and articulating it can reinforce these reasons but it often doesnt seem to stick does it you find that after a few days your weed addicted brain tears those reasons to shreds. it wont be that expensive if i smoke times a month or the biggest lie i finally have control and can now smoke again. if you could control your weed usage you wouldnt be here. sometimes you relapse because you truly have convinced yourself that you cannot function or be happy sober so you reluctantly return back to the marijuana. want to know why it will sound like an accusation but it is the underlying truth of the situation. you never made a serious attempt to change the mindset that drives these compulsions. you have been trying control your actions by quitting weed not the mindset that dictates our actions. therefore it is no surprise that many simply trade on addition for another. still the same underlying thought process just a different addiction. you are still desperately seeking for external sources to derive meaning and happiness from. when in reality happiness blooms from within. deep down or maybe not even that deep down you still wish you could smoke if it just didnt do to you. you still think weed could play a role in your life. you still want to smoke every day if things were different some alternate reality in which it was actually harmless. unfortunately you live in this universe where it is holding you back to a degree that you may not even realize. i certainly didnt for a long time. it made me complacent i was happy being a stoner and therefore stopped attempting to reach my admittedly ambitious goals. i hope to elaborate on this fundamental concept further in the following parable i wrote appropriately titled the mirage. the mirage imagine yourself in the third person. you are walking in a forest probably smoking a nicely rolled joint or hitting your favorite pipe. it is a beautiful forest no matter if you are sober or high. green foliage as far as the eye can see dense trees and wildlife abound. you can go any direction youd like but you chose stick to the path. everyone else always seems to and youre pretty sure you dont have a choice to stray if you tried. though the areas beyond the path are breathtaking they are also a bit intimidating you almost never see footprints outside of the path. after walking for what seems like an eternity you come across a fork in the path. down one path is a hedonists dream. it is your favorite hiking spot the base of a large ravine with a huge river pouring down the middle. it has all your favorite activities limitless high quality bud wax maybe even tobacco if youre like me. it has a big television to re watch sitcoms and an xbox with a vr headset to play the latest games. it has a nice record player for your favorite albums. everything is covered in silky velvet and extremely comfortable. it is full of delicious food and drink and you wonder if you just found heaven on earth. there is no responsibility down this path you are free to spend your time doing whatever youd like. it has all your stoner buds too all passing the bong and laughing about everything and anything. of course you see yourself running down that path. youve always been a little unsatisfied with life and this seems like the ultimate escape from what seems like an otherwise mundane and stressful life. you see yourself sit down and rip that first bowl with your buds thinking you could live here for the rest of your life. and so you do. you smoke so much weed that you are permanently couch locked. you enjoy any and all food you can get your hands on. your buddies tell stories from your youth sometimes repeating themselves. you dont mind though youre ripped after all barely listening. days months and finally years go by. you believe yourself to have everything one needs to be happy. therefore you truly believe you are happy. sure you are occasionally curious what that other path was and why it even exists. surely everyone would make the same decision given the same circumstances right the other path is covered in rocks and foliage. it seems like a continuous un ending incline. the trees are denser initially resulting in a dark hue across the forest. it seems to be less traveled but you still notice the occasional fresh footprint. many seem to have gone down this path in the past. parts of the path have eroded completely while others lead back to the weed filled life. you notice further down that this path also continues to branch off. the trees clear to reveal meadows lush with flowers on some paths while others are encased in darkness with the stench of death in the air. in fact it seems this forest has endless different paths one could take depending on their inclination. each path seems to offer its own unique beauty and charm on the surface. you still are left wondering why anyone would chose any of these paths as their seems to be no comfort no safety. the trails end often with individuals gathering and forming small communities. some of them seem happy but you are not convinced. you see evidence that others have arrived at these dead ends but chosen to continue onwards instead of settling or turning back. do they know something that these others do not or are they simply mad you notice a man breaking off from one of these dead ends forming his own path into the forest. he is wearing tattered clothing only carrying what he deems essential for life. he seems miserable at first glance often falling over and covered in bruises. he looks very old but under closer inspection is only a few years older than yourself. you then notice that beneath the dirt smeared across his face he is smiling. you are shocked you ask yourself how could a man with nothing no comfort or safety seem happier than your friends and yourself even. you start to resent him he obviously is crazy or delusional for seeking out this dangerous path riddled with warning signs of failure and misery. it is obvious that many have chosen to turn back at this point in the forest or chosen to settle for a dead end that brings them comfort and security. this man on the other hand speeds up as he passes a dead end. doesnt he know the trail ends here you ask yourself his smile broadens and he begins running as fast as he can up into a seemingly hazardous area. you yell out to him asking are you lost why are you out here all alone he stops running and invites you to walk with him for a bit. he explains that he initially came out here with all his friends years ago after graduating high school. he says that soon after they began this exciting journey one of his friends found another path in the forest that leads to a place full of happiness sheltered from the hardships they were encountering. he found a mirage the man explains a prison that presents itself as a paradise free from pain. they would would stay in contact slowly convincing his other friends to join him after the trials of this path became too much to handle. initially they would try and continue to talk to the man asking when he was going to return to them. the friends would tell him about how much he was missing and how everything was so much better with them. but he didnt see it that way. the man loved the challenges he faced on a daily basis. he admitted that it wasnt always easy in fact he had even gone back to the start at times to join his friends. but it never did anything for him. sure he found it comforting. he found it enjoyable at first. but deep down he always knew it was a prison. he knew deep down that this path this mirage was a dead end it was a purgatory for those too afraid to see what the other paths had to offer. driven mad by the monotony and numbness of the so called paradise he continued down other paths sometimes turning back sometimes struggling for months before reaching an end. he had accomplished many things in that time away from his comforts. he had found great joy down other paths things that brought him the same level of joy his friends had found. and yet it was different he felt a sense of accomplishment a sense of satisfaction that his efforts were not in vein. that being said he was never satisfied with these either. the main explained that he discovered the further he pushed himself the greater the end result always was. he quickly started choosing to often break off from the path entirely discovering new ways of reaching these end results these dead ends that had stopped many before him in their tracks. quicker ways more efficient ways. he learned to identify which paths were worth avoiding and which were worth his time and energy. though the challenges never ceased they became easier to tackle. the man found that each dead end had many potential paths that were simply unmarked reserved for those brave enough to tackle them. after some research he found that many of the worlds most successful people had gone down unmarked paths similar to those he was chasing. he became more adept at finding these hidden paths while becoming more capable at dealing with the hardships thrown at him in the process. his body and mind had grown stronger while his friends bodies withered away in front of the tv. while they were busy playing video games he had slowly discovered an inner peace a satisfaction with never being satisfied. he had come to accept these daily challenges as part of this path he chose. he had made peace with it as he knew deep down it was necessary if he wanted to become the best version of himself. he went from being afraid of the challenges initially to running at them full speed. he no longer feared the pain but accepted it as part of the process. he even began to enjoy the pain as it meant he was doing something worth his time and energy. after this many years his worst fear had become his best friends aspirations. complacency. being satisfied doing nothing being satisfied with reaching a decent end result. decent was no longer good enough for the man he claimed. sure a moment of stillness was welcomed and necessary to rest his aging bones and occasionally soak in the beauty around him. too long however and anxiety filled his thoughts. fear of missing opportunities fear of a mundane life. after his experiences in that mirage and seeing what it did to his friends he knew that it he could never settle anymore. he had experienced too much achieved too much risen too much to slide all the way back to the start. he knew that these trials he faced are a natural part of choosing this life the path that many of humanities greatest individuals had been down before. he knew that pain and struggle were natural phenomenon and therefore should not be avoided. the man had realized realized that the paradise was the only thing unnatural in this forest. people escaping reality by hiding from it right at the start of their journey never experiencing the joys and successes that the other countless paths had to offer. sure they know they exist but they cling to the belief that the challenges couldnt possibly be worth the payoff. and in a sense the man said they were right. the payoff isnt worth it. but the man understood something that his friends could never hope to life isnt about the end result at all but about the journey one take to strive towards it. many times the man had achieved his goal only to find the goal wasnt what he expected. many times the man had spent months working for something only to have the path blocked by something unforeseeable and out of his control. but the man didnt fret as in the process of chasing these goals he had learned more about himself than his friends ever would what he was capable of what his real goals and aspirations are and how to better implement a plan to achieve them. over the years apart the man had developed a broad range of skills to face even the most difficult times with ease while his friends never developed these skills at all. he knew could weather the most brutal trials and tribulations while his friends lived and died without ever exploring their true capabilities and potential. while his friends had only been focused on what the forest could give to them the man realized early on that it isnt what we get from achieving our goals that is important but what you become from striving to achieve them. the struggle people are not lazy. they simply have impotent goals that is goals that do not inspire them. so the first part of changing your mindset is understanding what you want and expect from life. so my question to you is where do you see yourself in 5 years no you didnt accidently stumble into an interview. that being said there is a very specific reason they ask you this question. it is asked to see if your goals line up with the companies core values. so answer that question honestly. then ask yourself if it is inline with your core values. when i was smoking heavy i saw myself smoking heavily for far longer than 5 years into the future. i also saw myself continuing to hiding it from my family i saw the thousands of dollars i would spend on it and i saw myself continuing to do whatever it takes to keep smoking this plant. i wouldnt have hesitated cheating on a drug test or lie to anyone who i didnt want to know about it. i wouldnt hesitate to put my health and safety into question to continue chasing this high. i would have kept smoking no matter what it cost me. core values are a critical element of any individual and it is often what seperates different cultures and groups of people from one another. hopefully you have a good idea of what yours are but if not this is a great time to reflect. a good way to identify them is think of the most ideal person in the world in your eyes or someone you look up to. what would their opinions be on everyday interactions hobbies pastimes politics or current events would they value integrity would they give back to their community also what would they be against would they support cheaters would they accept of my tendency to lie about my habits there are plenty of resources online for this part too. my 3 most important core values are determination integrity and generosity. i see my ideal self striving to achieve any goal i put my mind too no matter how painful or inconvenient. i see myself not lying to family friends and others who deserve the truth. i also dont see myself intentionally misleading people which is a constant reality for a young stoner like myself. i see myself ideally giving back to my communities i consider myself apart of whether with my time and energy or a monetary donation. so how well did i stack up extremely poorly is my honest answer. i constantly lie to many people in my life no one is off limits. i have lied to teachers i lie to employers i lie to my parents about weed money and even the most mundane things for fun. i have never been generous since i started smoking weed. i have denied homeless people food when i have plenty and have stolen so much weed in my life i lost count. i have showed little empathy to friends and family. i have so much love to give to the world but instead i just focused on myself and nothing else. i always put myself first and look where it got me. nowhere. i am more miserable than ever so dont worry i didnt get away with any of it in the end. after an analysis of how my thought process differed from my actions i realized that something had to give. what i thought i valued was meaningless if i could not act on any of it. i was that friend that would say i wanted to do xyz and then never follow through. i became known for it. i was also that friend that would be cool to your face only to talk about your flaws behind your back. i talked about close friends in hurtful ways and even bullied some of my less close friends. i didnt care as long as it helped me. it was all about me. i couldnt care less when i heard 40 us citizens were mowed down in a bar in florida a few months ago as long as it wasnt me. sure i put on a mask and pretended to care but i didnt. it had no impact on me. getting high was the same all about me and how i felt not about how it affected others. the shift i am not oblivious i knew how weed was effecting my actions and causing me to change as an individual. i saw the signs early and often. but you know the great thing about weed is that it can suppress these thoughts. those nagging pings from my sober self yelling at me to stop being such a self centered prick were silenced completely until i honestly 100 thought my actions were ok and justified. so what was i escaping from why was i starting to act in such a harmful way towards myself and those around me it was because i hated myself and weed was slowly stopping to suppress this reality. why did i hate myself because i have an acute anxiety about failure creating a viscous cycle. i would start to slip in school have strong pings of anxiety and use weed to comfort me. the weed would cause me to slip more in school and therefore more anxiety followed by you guessed it – more pot. i have always put extreme pressure on myself its just how i was raised. i wanted to be the best but for the first time in my life it was becoming more and more clear that i wasnt. so i lashed out. i was angry at the world and was so fed up with it that i retreated entirely. i quit. sure i kept trying to study and do my best but emotionally i was dead. my moral compass had disappeared in a cloud of smoke i felt i was wronged so i did wrong. this is why i was accepting of all the ignorant shit i was doing. this is how i justified my actions. things werent going how i wanted so like a spoiled brat i spent all my time in my room focusing on my own feelings. over and over i would play the same situations in my head. i was the ultimate white knight only i was protecting myself from the seemingly harsh realities of life. when in reality i am extremely fortunate and blessed but was too distracted to see it. so what changed what triggered the change in mindset honestly it was a single quote. be the best version of yourself i wasnt. not only was i engaging in the egotistical disgusting activities listed above but weed had also started to cause me to fail my classes. how do i know it was weed could be anything you may be thinking. well i have always been quite studious. as a double major i spend the majority of my free time studying. we are talking 5 hours of classes a day and 5 hours of studying too. on the weekends i would take adderall and study for 8 hours. but even with all this effort i was failing. now more than ever literally failing. and it was because i was smoking before during and after studying. i dont know what i was thinking but once i received those grades it was obvious that if i didnt make a drastic change then i would fail this semester therefore graduating late and having my job offer revoked. i saw myself as having two distinct choices two different paths in my journey through the forest. i could continue smoking and potentially ruin my future or i could quit right there. the choice was finally clear. it was obvious that weed had no place in my life anymore. it had always been obvious to everyone but myself. once i had this epiphany quitting weed became as easy as quitting coffee. sure i suffered through minor withdrawals. i failed to sleep more than a few hours every night the first week. i had trouble eating and was often waking up dry heaving from the nausea. but i have a few tips that i can share later on that really helped me overcome these symptoms and others with relative ease. so why do we seem to struggle with addiction when so many others can use weed and other substances as intended the key difference is mindset. they are using it to enhance life while you are using it as a crutch to get through life. but dylan i use marijuana when i go hiking it makes it so much better im sure you do that was my favorite time too. but i bet you are just as likely to use it when you are feeling down too. i bet that when you get home after a rough day tired and beaten down by lifes daily trials your first thought is to light up. im willing to bet that you use it for almost every emotion imaginable. happy sad lonely depressed overjoyed angry confused bored. at that point it is no longer enhancing life. it is life. it is where you derive stability to level out the highs and lows. eventually if you smoke enough for long enough you end up flat lining completely. imagine a life support machine slowly transitioning from steady peaks and valleys to the dreaded flat line. we all know what that means the end of the individuals body and soul. only weed is much slower then that. it is obvious to friends and family that you are changing but you hardly notice. it is only when you are dead inside that you look up and see that everyone has written you off as dead for years not without lack of trying on their part but lack of reciprocation on yours. no matter your current circumstances you too are facing a crossroad in your life. maybe you havent been pushed to the wall yet. maybe it truly hasnt effected you that much. my response to these claims and those of a similar nature is simple. why wait why wait until your habit hurts a loved one. why wait till it puts you in financial jeopardy. why wait till it has caused you so much pain that you are driven into a depressive state. why are you so afraid of living a sober life a life where you are free to chase your goals and aspirations at any time of the day. are you really that satisfied with your current status that you think giving up weed will only detract from your happiness imagine meeting an alternate version of yourself a version that hadnt welcomed weed into your life. how would you picture him or her surely they would be more successful and happy spending their free time enriching their in mind body and soul opposed to burning a dried out plant. our brain can trick us into believing almost anything but it cannot distort reality enough to suggest that we are happier wasting a significant portion of our lives smoking weed. whether you like it or not the only time you can make this change and get back on the right path is now. the only thing that truly exists in the world is this current moment. you cannot change how you spent all those years you cannot get back the money youve figuratively burned to chase a high that is no longer obtainable. but you can still change. you can stop smoking right now. no you dont have to finish your stash first. you dont have to wait till tuesday or some other arbitrary point in the future to quit. the future doesnt exist and will never exist in a sense it will always be the future. if you truly want to be the best version of yourself and taste the sweet fruit that life offers to those brave enough to face it head on you need to make your last smoke just that – your last smoke. the withdrawls once you make the decision i promise you it will not be has hard as it seems. you will suffer initially but what are a few days of suffering compared to a lifetime of greatness and achievement. you can expect at worst one to two weeks of moderate symptoms. difficulty sleeping nausea loss of appetite and irritability are all semi common. gosh dont those sound lame when put into perspective its the mental aspect that was always the hard part. without the addicts brain consistently doubting your decision weed withdrawals are about as extreme as a hangover and typically last a similar amount of time. they are nothing to fear in fact they should be embraced. its the first signs of the end of your addiction. these are not permanent in the slightest and will pass as quickly as they appeared. now the part of withdrawals that were most noticeable to me was fogginess in the head lightheadedness anxiety and fatigue. for myself i found that taking a multi vitamin fish oil magnesium and iron supplements were critical to rebounding quickly. i will start by discussing the last two magnesium and iron. anemia occurs when you have a level of red blood cells rbcs in your blood that is lower than normal. this occurs when you are not getting enough iron in your diet. the symptoms of low iron are fatigue lightheadedness and fogginess. sound familiar i have a theory that since most stoners not all of course seem to have a poor diet lacking in red meats eggs and leafy greens that they are often low on iron. a simple supplement once a day preferably with vitamin c for absorption should get you on the right track. magnesium is a bit trickier. many of the symptoms of low magnesium are not unique to magnesium deficiency making it difficult to diagnose with 100 accuracy. that being said suffers are often filled with anxiety depression fatigue lightheadedness etc. vague symptoms but it is present in most multivitamins so it is worth experimenting with. i found that it helped my anxiety but it can be hard to determine if its a placebo or the magnesium itself. on top of all of this focus on drinking as much water as possible. this will help you feel refreshed for starters but also should help with fatigue and fogginess as well. plus the whole vital for life thing too ☺ the replacement most people on this earth have some sort of coping mechanism to deal with the trials faced in everyday life. some play video games or binge watch tv others find themselves getting lost in an art project or other creative outlet. i believe that implementing healthier activities into your life is critical for filling the void in your life left after quitting weed. this time however it is important that your coping mechanism is building up your core values not acting as a detriment to yourself and your character. sure in an ideal world you would only derive your happiness from within and that is still the end goal. for now i needed some way of focusing all my free time into something productive. i have been practicing meditation to stabilize my emotions rid myself of anxiety and rid myself of all thoughts entirely for a short time. this has helped me tremendously in getting the same calmness the same stillness that i only occasionally got from weed in the first place. for me i also replaced marijuana with skateboarding and learning how to draw with charcoal. these work for me because i love being creative and staying physically fit. they are in line with my core values as i have poured my heart and soul into them and have even started giving skateboard lessons to a friends brother to help pass on my skills. this subreddit has many examples of great healthier coping mechanisms that you can incorporate. but honestly you know what works for you best. what are your passions if you cant think of something specific or dont have the same passions anymore and dont know where to start i may be able to help. exercise is a big one as it releases plenty of dopamine and can help accelerate thc leaving your body. creativity is another critical aspect of our lives that is often overlooked. i think creative pastimes are so so important as they allow us to truly be engrossed in the process. they stimulate both sides of our brain like nothing else and can be very helpful for thinking of unique solutions to the daily struggles in your life. i am very career focused so i would also try and find a programskillhobby that can be used to leverage your knowledge and experience in your field. for example i recently started teaching my self a data analytics software called essbase. sound boring its not. boring activities are not actually boring its a sign that you have a boring mind. life is all about perspective. sure you can cast off everything that sounds confusing and difficult as too boring to be worth it. but what if you accepted the mundaneness and eventually learned to love it data analytics for those unaware is using a large volume of data from multiple sources to derive patterns and therefore conclusions. these conclusions can be used to market a firms product or service more effectively and with less resources. this increases the enterprise value of the firm and overall leads to more profit. while you may look at the data and be put off right away if you can just spend enough time to learn how to interpret it it becomes extremely fun. its fun like solving a puzzle is fun. it stimulates your brain forces you to think critically and and use the analytical part of your brain while also leveraging the creative side. if you do it right you and everyone else at the company is going to make more money and have more job security. im not saying you have to love data analytics. of course not it was just an example of how casting aside potential career building activities because theyre not fun is silly. i think that if you find your ideal industry and put effort into specializing in some aspect of it that calls to you you will be much better off. you wont be passionate about them all but dont disregard them without giving them a fair shot. are you in it and dont know how to code or want to learn a new language good time to start do you love music but want to branch out your career take an online music management course. learn a new instrument. are you working a dead end job and dont know where to begin maybe start looking for unions in your area and see if there are online resources to build a knowledge base on and maybe get an online certificate. these are just my ideas. i know nothing about what you will find interesting or what your goals are. this is the hard part. the summary conclusion in conclusion quitting weed is entirely doable once you accept that there is an underlying cause for the addiction. weed is not and never was the problem the problem is internal not external. the problem is your outlook in life and weed is just playing a role in this. i was a whiny teenager who only cared about the worlds impact on myself not my impact on the world. i eventually had my back thrown against the wall finally revealing how silly the whole thing was. but it does not have to go that far. you do not have to be pinned against the wall faced with an ultimatum. comfort is overrated anyways i doubt you would like to sit in a beanbag chair watching tv for the rest of your life. comfort is the enemy of achievement. if you want to succeed more then you want to be comfortable more then you want to smoke pot then and only then will you be successful. i was drawn to all the wrong things i liked to drink i was lazy i did not have a god politics ideas ideals. i was settled into nothingness a kind of non being and i accepted it. i did not make for an interesting person. i did not want to be interesting it was too hard. what i really wanted was only a soft hazy space to live in and to be left alone. on the other hand when i got drunk i screamed went crazy got all out of hand. one kind of behavior did not fit the other. i did not care. i find a lot of similarities between weed abuse and alcohol abuse. same underlying emotions same actions as a result just a different substance driving it. just because weed does not damage your liver does not make it better. do your core values line up with your actions if not its time to re evaluate. i hope you enjoyed this write up let me know if any parts were confusing and i can elaborate further. i can only express my own opinions that being said i have read 100s of posts

what weed really does to me hint its not worth it i made it about 12 days and was feeling so goodmore energy clear headed and all that jazz. im trying to be positive and remind myself that hey at least i did not let myself lose control for more than a few days. im back here. i saw someone post a list before what it really does to me so here is mine as a reminder to myself 1. it steals my energy. 2. it makes me overeat. 3. it occupies way too much of my mental space. 4. it causes me to lose time. 5. it drains my wallet. 6. it makes me stumble over my words and sound generally less intelligent. 7. it puts me in a bad mood when im coming down. 8. it makes me selfish. this is not the drugs fault but i am an addict and therefore i prioritize getting high over all else. 9. it increases my anxiety and gives me uncomfortable body sensations. 10. it makes me feel foggy and slow. weve got this leavers one day at a time.,joy
just a suggestion you know how when you first started smoking you thought i wonder what it will be like to try x activity while high well now youre likely in a place where youre high most of the time. you want to be sober. so why not think i wonder what it will be like to go back to doing x activity while sober this method has really helped me develop a newfound appreciation for the finer details i always missed when i was lit in a way its almost like doing those things again for the first time because the weed had me so out of touch with reality. hope this helps,joy
after 14 years of daily weed abuse and 25000 joints i am now sober for 53 days hi guys i used to scroll this topic alot while smoking. ive been smoking since i was 16 more regular in my last 2 years of highschool and daily after that. i remember when i started uni and i just felt the urge to smoke went home light one up and never came back ive never really worked jobs longer then 4 months and was always high. you know how it goes you still function well because everybody knows you like that. i had alot of trauma in my life in a 6 months stretch i lost my mother due to cancer my house burned on fire due to electricity malfunction and my father commited suïcide. to make matters worse i had a psychopath friend who was out to get me back cause his girlfriend had a crush on me and tried to use this period to set people up against me. i finally quit on the 14th of august. this was the final drop ive met an amazing girl who became my girlfriend and i went camping in her backyard. when we woke up she made breakfast and after that i just filled some dumb excuse to leave and go home smoking weed. i remember laying down in bed offcourse smoking i always had a rolled joint always and she texted me that she wanted to break up. it broke my heart but i understood. after that i was sick of it could not believe i even fucked that up i planned a session for weedhypnosis and suprisingly it kind of worked. i was sweating tremendous from my hands the first week and i could smell the weed from met odor but no real withdrawels for the rest. i am still jobless i live of poker music and investments and somewhat still lazy see my friends a lot less lost one good friend felt like he was using me and when i adressed all the things for him he did not take it the wrong wat. you think everything will be fixed after you quit weed but you still have your weaknesses and everything but i am still proud. i also got my girlfriend back and its going better then ever. she is a active kind person and my abuse just did not match. all i want to say is if i can do it everybody can but you have to make the concious decision and maybe even try hypnosis. best of luck to all,joy

how addiction works in the brain i posted this as a comment and i got a few private messages saying i should post it to the whole group. some of us are truly world champions at being so incredibly hard on ourselves and that can make staying sober even harder. so maybe this can help a few people realize your brain is working just fine. its doing what it was meant to do and you just need some updating of your knowledge. the way addiction works in the brain is like this you know how you drive to the grocery store from your house you probably do not even need to think about it. its ingrained there in a neural pathway cause youve just done it so many times and your brain does not have to use much energy to do something its done repeatedly. now when youre doing something new that youve never done before its like driving to the grocery store from your house but across everyones yards and driveways knocking down their bushes and trash cans. but after a while if you kept driving thru everyones yards it would knock down the bushes tamp down the grass and pretty soon youd have a smooth path that you could drive on. this is how the brain works we use the well worn neural pathways the most. we are always making new pathways unless were down regulating our brains thru drugs alcohol stimulants etc and paving over old habits that we are not doing anymore or lost interest in. you can actually see this in mris. fascinating stuff. now the brain is designed to seek pleasure avoid pain and conserve energy the motivational triad . so whatever we seek pleasure in or any other repetitive behaviors becomes one of those very well worn pathways and our brains do not have to use much energy for repetitive habits. its easy to keep going back to the habit your brain knows because it is seeking pleasure and conserving energy to stay alive. a lot of us will say i do not want to keep smoking why am i doing this well this is why. your new neural pathways from being sober are going to take a bit of time to get inculcated lets call this you 2.0 you are literally updating your own operating system now. branding yourself an addictive personality is probably a misnomer. you just have habits. nothing bad or good. just habits. like all the other humans 😊 and soon you will have new habits. so be gentle with yourself and maybe give your brain new things to play with. brains love goals and working on problems. start thinking about what you want to accomplish today this month next month next year five years etc. you got his edited to say thank you for the gold im thankful people found it helpful 😊,joy
a really good reason to go sober you can differentiate your high mind from your sober one whenever im in a stoner phase i start to believe my high thoughts are my actual thoughts and it fucks with my sense of self. its nice to be sober for a bit so you can remember who you really are,joy
upvote this if you are strong individual who does not need any weed today my housemate have been smoking since midnight last night but im proud of myself for being able to just walk away and not give in to this day like i have the past 7 years of my life.,joy
random thought on being a functional stoner hey guys. currently on the sober train after many failed attempts. got to thinking about this the other day id describe myself probably along with many others as having been a functional stoner. graduated early with several internships and decent grades. been employed and doing pretty well at work since i left college. fairly regular exercise routine and social life etc. all this is pretty good for a daily user yeah i used to pride myself on being a functional stoner. but the other day i just thoughtis that really all i aspire to all i want to be in this life functional why not successful accomplished passionate loving driven excited vibrant etc why just stop at getting by or doing pretty well all things considered if this is how ive managed with daily weed use i can only imagine where id be without it. but its never too late so heres to a fresh start.,joy
38 days clean and i realize boredom is a part of life ive grown up with this fantasy that everyone else is always doing something fun and exciting all the time with friends and im the only person who has to sit with boredom and being alone. but as ive gotten more clean time im realizing that my understanding of how others were living was skewed. while its good to be busy no one can be busy all the time. and for those people who are never alone i think that speaks volumes about their ability to sit with themselvestheir thoughts.,joy

my grandpa died and nobody even gives a shit my grandpa died the other day and not one person in my life has said sorry for your loss. the closest i got was emailing my professor and all she said was my condolences please have you late work done in a few days ive been sober for like a month now and all of a sudden im remembering why i always got high so i could feel as cold and uncaring as everyone else is. sorry for the rant but its pretty obvious nobody in my life gives a shit about how im doing so here i am. edit thank you for all the kind words everyone. i promise ill stay sober double edit really wish i could spend the time to say thank you to all of you did not expect this post to get so much attention and i really do appreciate all the kind words. im still sober still kicking and just want to say thank you to all of you 3,anger
progress had a shit day today and felt really depressed. long story short i asked my brother for a joint after being 14 days clean. i picked it up rolled it went to my favourite smoking spot to go numb myself as i always would. could not bring myself to light it and ended up throwing it away as i knew i would regret it immediately. this is something ive never been able to do previously. progress.,sadness

ive been sober for 28 days i havent smoked weed in 28 days and i have nobody to tell. if i told my parents they would be concerned that this was an accomplishment as they have no idea how severe my use got. if i told my friends they would invite me to spark one up with them as celebration. as of today ive accomplished my longest sober stretch in the last 2 years but apart from this subreddit i have nobody to tell.,joy
your brain saying i think i can go back to moderation it will be different this time is just two cravings standing on each others shoulders in a trenchcoat and a hat. it seems like a mature thought but you have to remind yourself that its just a craving like anything else.,joy

you know what the most annoying thing about smoking weed for me was always thinking about how people perceive me. afraid to speak my mind because i fear that ill hurt someone. i remember in high school i was cocky and kinda arrogant. weed made me aware of that so i chilled out on the cockiness. but in my opinion i chilled out so much that i became so timid. i feel like that cockiness was my spark and weed made me overthink it too much. im now on day 71 and finally see my cockiness returning very slowly. im no longer trapped inside my mind worried about how people perceive me. whenever that comes up im like wait hold up i dont give a fuck lol. it feels good. 🤩,fear

replace your weed habit with something that you enjoy sober but dont enjoy high for example i cant read a book when im high. i just dont have the focus or mental capacity to sit there reading and actually understand whats going on. but i love reading when im not high. so i did some research and found a book i knew id love and every time i had a craving at night i would read that book. it really helped me to initially stop smoking and it gave me something to look forward to. whats something that you enjoy sober or think you could enjoy but that you usually dont do after smoking maybe you like art or baking or working out but when youre blazed you usually dont bother. try replacing the times you would be smoking with this hobby and just like i bought a new book maybe you could buy some new art supplies or workout gloves for example. it serves as inspiration and a reminder to indulge in that hobby rather than smoking. i hope this tip helps and cheers to a new year,joy
my weed addiction snuck up on me and stayed around long after it made itself known. i have a crystal clear recollection of stumbling across rleaves at one time and then quickly leaving because it was much too threatening. since quitting this past june its been a major daily support. thank you all. daily visits here give me insight and courage to stay the course. folks who are just starting out get my comments encouraging them to go ahead and know it does get easier that sleep returns along with ones appetite. folks who post about relapsing evoke my profound gratitude for helping warn me of the pitfalls of thinking i can smoke ‘just this once without paying a price. long term users like me who post their stories help me feel like less of a fool for allowing the decades to have slipped by. every single day i live without my old habit getting the better of gives me a sense of pride as well as humility. i feel proud i have made it through another day weed free and also deeply humbled that somehow i have managed to find the strength to avoid using. i know there are zero guarantees that this period of abstinence lasts. i need to face every day with full resolve. some days are much easier than others. for this addict it truly is one damn day at a time. thanks for reading.,joy
i started to think i could never quit. today im one week sober hi guys ive followed this community for what feels like forever now. i have tried and told myself id quit far too many times to ever count. the number of journal entries i have stating this is it is embarrassing and i really lost faith in myself and my ability to turn things around. i was the smart girl who had her shit together until i started smoking around the age of 20. fast forward 10 years it had stopped being fun a long time ago. it was now serving another purpose which was masking the ugly painful feelings that simmered under the surface. i knew i was letting my life waste away and i could not deal with it. i smoked constantly about 18 a day waking up every few hours throughout the night to smoke 3 4 bowls just so i could fall back asleep. i was not even living. i was numbing blocking out not only the negative feelings but everything. nothing felt good or brought me joy anymore. i stopped writing making art reading books etc. and started to become a recluse. i did not even know who i was anymore. eventually the weed just was not doing enough for me. i started drinking more. or i would tell myself i would not smoke weed just to get drunk and order a weed delivery a few hours later. in those moments it felt like the only way i could cope with my own existence. but here i am. i have not had weed or alcohol in a week and im almost in disbelief. just wanted to share this win with a community that has helped me to feel like im not alone in this. you are not alone in this either. none of us are. like they say over at rstopdrinking i will not smoke with you today.,sadness
things ive noticed since quitting weed 1 month 1. my social anxiety has all but ceased to exist 2. my energy levels are much higher 3. i can run up a flight of stairs without feeling winded out of breath 4. i get hungry without needing to smoke 5. im not grouchy when i dont smoke 6. my mental health is in a much better place 7. im better at video games 8. i dont even crave weed 9. i have more money than i know what to do with because im not spending 20 a day on bud 10. im happier than ive been in months 11. my head is clear and i dont just have nonsense loops anymore 12. people seem to like me more people i know and strangers alike 13. i am fulfilled by normal activities i dont know how ive done it. its like my pre frontal cortex finally developed and something in my brain just clicked and somehow after struggling with every day smoking for years quitting became easy. i quit both mary jane and vaping at the same time and its incredible all the benefits ive seen in such a short period of time. i believe in every single one of the wonderful people on this sub you guys can do it,anger
who wants to be my witness,joy
if youre high everyday youre not yourself youre a crappy knock off version. youre maybe 50 of who you could actually be. youve customised your body and mind to need a substance to function. without it you likely revert to irritable child like behavior. nobody as a kid says when i grow up i wanna be a stoner i wanna exist at about 50 of my full potential i want to be dependent on weed to be happy i wanna live in a haze everydaysorry to be harsh but maybe its what you need to hear.,anger
hi leavers👋🏻if you sort posts by new you can see if someone else has just posted what you might be about to so you two can relate together👩🏼‍🤝‍👨🏻try seeking out unanswered posts to make someone feel seen. they may really appreciate it🥺do not assume were all men cos were not💅🏻 thanks💛 being semi serious for a moment ive had posts go unreplied to and i do not care 🤷🏼‍♀️ i seriously do not give a shit i spout utter pap half the time😆 but for other people it can be hard. we all like to be seen acknowledged. if youve got the time look for a post with no replies and if you can relate or offer support give them a moment of your time. takes a lot of courage to post here for some people. not me obviously i never shut up 🤷🏼‍♀️ but in the sometimes scary and lonely world of addiction sometimes one comment can brighten the room enough for someone to have hope again. by sorting by new instead of whats hot not only may you catch a post while the poster is still online so you can actually almost talk and relate in real time and they may have just posted the same thing you were going to but you may catch someone posting whos about to relapse and asking for help. and although its no one elses responsibility at all simply encouraging them not to may be enough in that moment of weakness. this is my last non check in post do not worry 😆 im getting off my soapbox i now have rleaves fatigue 😳🥳 extra obligatory emojis as requested 😘😜 😊😇💁🏼‍♀️👑🙄😏😆 day 78.5 stay strong everyone 💛 and if youve got this far yes i have tits 🤭 eta 8 hours later im signing out of reddit now cos my head is battered but compassion is my main point. male or female. does not matter. the female aspect of my post was probably 5 of the content but apparently what caused the most response were all humans we all matter and we all deserve to be heard.,joy
im quitting weed today ive been a daily user since i was 16. my high school boyfriend introduced me to it. im 27 now. i recently got my dream job teaching and within a month i lost that job. it seems that its due to me smoking weed every day. i do not care about anything i do not have any motivation. i went in and half assed my job teaching children. im quitting smoking weed to try and better myself. i have smoked every since day since i was sixteen. im definitely emotionally addicted. im really nervous how this will effect my emotional state because i also have anxiety and depression. i gave up drinking alcohol at the beginning of this year and that gives me hope of being able to quit weed too. wish me luck people. edit im reading through all of the comments carefully. thank you everybody for your support. it really helps to know im not alone in this. i got myself a journal and a bike so im hoping to use those items to help me get through this.,sadness

5 months without weed lessons ive learned i wanted to write a little bit about my journey with quitting weed. and what ive learned so far. i unsubscribed from this sub after about 2 months just so i could have minimal reminders that weed was even a thing however ill always be so thankful for all the stories i read here and how it helped me feel like i was not alone on this journey. 5 months give or take a few days is where im at now and its the longest ive gone in over 6 years. the first time i smoked weed was out of a gravity bong made from a 2 liter fanta bottle at the skatepark when i was 16. i fell in love the first time i smoked. everything seemed better literally everything. the day after that i smoked weed and the day after that and the day afteri went around 6 7 years without a single day sober. i mean smoking from morning until night all day high. going to work high class high every activity high wasting countless hours watching stupid youtube videos smoking myself to the point of isolation and even when i stopped enjoying weed because of the awkward feeling social affect it seemed to give me after about 5 years i kept going. smoking alone everyday. i could write a novel about my experience i think but i want to keep this short in case it can help anyone. here are some lessonsproblems and things to look out for that ive encountered so far. i hope i can help someone like so many helped me on this sub 1. be careful that after quitting smoking your brain will search for other ways to avoid being sober alcohol was the biggest for me and i have gotten it under control but beware of this your brain will realize weed is not an option and for some of us will move to the next best things. 2. after a few months youll laugh at the fact weed would control your life in the way it did. for my fellow ex 247 smokers only sober when youre asleep weed seems impossible to live without however it really is possible many people in fact the majority of the world goes the day without smoking weed you can too. 3. it only benefits people in very rare cases yes weed has proven to help seizures and vets with ptsd fall asleep but for the majority of us it is not needed so many of my stoner friends would fool themselves and convince themselves they needed to smoke that somehow it was helping themjust plain wrong. weed slows you down it saps your physical energy your mind may explode with creativity in the first 20 min after smoking however all your left with is remnants of those ideas and a body to tired to act on any of them. 4. when weed exits reality steps in and this can be that hardest part. emotion will crawl back in. from everything like getting road rage to crying over an ex or something feelings you have pushed away for years will come right back. humans are meant to feel youre not supposed to be in some steady state all the time. its okay to reminisce about good times with mary jane i got so many fond memories. but it was time to move on mary jane when i abused her made me a shell of myself. 5. a sense of determination was the biggest thing that came back to me. quitting is not a cure all it is far from it in fact some things get way worse but thats because theyre supposed to be that way. quitting simply allows you to start facing these problems. when bored your brain looks for something to do to better your situation a signal that youre wasting time weed strips this away because it makes simple entertainment youtube tv video games so much more intoxicating. 6. so many worries go away. no more worrying about running out no more grimacing as you drop more cash on an eighth thatll be gone in two days no more worrying about the smell the tired look falling asleep in the middle of the day no more avoiding family and situations where its not appropriate to be high. i do not want the post to be too long i rambled on here i have so many more things ive learned i could share but were all in this together and experiences are sometimes eerily similar among us. its been a journey of ups and downs from smoking 20 bong rips of weed and tobacco plus a few blunts everyday to no weed at all for around 5 months. ive got so much more to go and so much more to fix about myself but i hope this post can maybe help some people. everyone who is trying to quit youre making a great decision and you can do it the only way out of something is through it and you can get through this. thanks to anyone who reads all of this keep posting and best of luck,sadness
im probably at least twice your age if not three times. and since i cant be a shining example let me at least share some hard won wisdom. every time ive relapsed ive ended up in the same place. stuck. trapped. lots of ideas very little action. disconnected. out of shape. unemployed. lonely. so much struggle every day. so much confusion forgetfulness exhaustion. the mess. the broken promises. the unreliability. the lost potential. my brain is damaged my vision is damaged cant see in the dark my lungs are damaged my retirement is nonexistent. this could be your future. i hope it isnt. ive been crying a lot lately about what i missed out on this life. but im gonna try again. ive been sober from alcohol for nine years quit smoking cigarettes a couple months ago. time to get clean again. very glad to have found yall i have my first 24 hours. 🙂,sadness
when you start weighing up the pros and cons of whether to use again its already too late the brain has an amazing ability to perform any mental gymnastics to justify using again. as soon as you catch yourself debating about whether to use immediately cut it off and distract yourself with something else. refuse to even have this discussion with yourself. the decision to stop has been made already it does not need to be re considered.,anger
honestly feel so good i could cry i am over two weeks sober from everything. i even quit coffee lol. and honestly this morning has been so nice i got tears in my eyes. my body feels right again. my head is clear. ive actually started to develop coping mechanisms for stress that are healthy. im enjoying life again. actually maybe for the first time because before i did not know how to handle my stress either. now im just enjoying my kid my cat my music my work my friends so much more than i ever did. please hang in there life is really so much better sober. use the pain of detoxing to find things that work for you yoga walking deep breathing meditation yoga baths whatever. because those things will serve you afterwards too. drugs and alcohol are very glamorized in our society but you do not need them to deal with hard times. they actually make things worse. i believe you can do it and i know you will be happier. lots of love and support to you all today,joy
correlation between not smoking and comments like you look really good and your eyes lookbrighter coming from ppl who have no idea about my journey with weed. ive been workshopping my relationship to cannabis and have fallen off and climbed back on over the course of last few years especially since late 2019. been pretty weed free for 2020 with a few blips here and there. my experiments have shown an interesting correlation i tend to get positive random compliments from people who have no clue about my journey when i havent been smoking. comments that my skin looks great that i generally look good etc. but beyond appearance i also just notice that my interactions are higher quality. people seem to respond better to me on a level that isnt necessarily verbal. cant really explain it. its becoming clear based on my interactions in the world that i vibrate higher when not smoking.,joy
day 80 ate an edible last night and it was nice for a little bit that familiar gently sparkling warmth. i went for a lovely run in the spring sun yes nowadays spring arrives in february. i felt like ok this isnt so bad i dont know what the big deal is but then the anxiety hit the fixation and amplification of past regrets. i hadnt felt that in months. then the zombification of the comedown. the plans i had for the evening drifted away as i wasted time scrolling through my phone and shuffling around the house. and this morning i am so dull and scatterbrained. i feel like my skull is packed with cotton candy. i cant start my work without distraction. i hadnt felt this in months. i cant believe this was a daily reality for me. yall told me but i didnt listen. in the moment i thought i could just have a taste the downside was a distant memory. it aint worth it. sobriety is so much better maybe not as dreamy but certainly sharper clearer more energetic more vivid more lifelike im not restarting my sobriety count. this is just a blip. im not going back.,joy
at day 90 today and i got to welcome home my twin boys it hasnt been easy but each day i stay clean it gets easier and easier this sub has been a tremendous help and i thank you all,joy
i think i found my purpose sometimes i feel its very hard to give up our bad habits and addictions till we find something that inspires us to live. i was about to sell my xbox one for 300 and i thought for a while thinking im just gonna spend that money on weed or other drugs i kind of had an ephiphany and decided to cancel the order and donate it to a local child with a family struggling this christmas. you have to be the change you want in the world. i think my purpose in this life is to serve others. lend a hand. were all in this together. the feeling i got when i found a local 13 year old boy in need in a facebook group cant compare to any substance ive ever took. i hope this post will encourage others to give back to their community this holiday season maybe finding their purpose along the way. i think now instead of buying weed ill instead spend that money on helping someone. id rather see my money go to making a difference in the world and not spent being content with my shitty position in life with substances.,sadness
day 3 a little rhyme i made. do not have much support around me so wanted to share with you all. some people smoke like once a month. just some hits or max 1 blunt. but thats not me i never was. since day 1 i loved the grass. no middle way for me to walk. i simply want to smoke it all. till all my feels are fully gone. and i can sleep till morning sun. but i wake up just feeling shit. lets have a walk and take a hit. is this the way to start my day for years to come without a change no. im done. it wo not be easy those sweaty nights. the vivid dreams no appetite. but thats no reason to give up now. cus im ready i made this vow. to stop this habit i only need to do one thing do not smoke no weed. 🤷🏻‍♂️ edit new poem a little thank you to this community,joy
spent 11 years straight high off my ass today is 3 months sober. this isnt a humble brag i just want you to know you can do it if you set your mind to it. from when i started high school until quite recently i was high just about every single day. i thought it was helping my anxiety and helping me cope with depression but it was just holding me back. if youre thinking about taking a leave just know i believe in you. if i can do it so can you. my biggest tip for someone whos ready to quit is dont force it. you need to hit that bottom and be completely disgusted with yourself and your herbs. you can get there. if you want support with your break feel free to dm me any time. you will love yourself sober.,joy
36 hours weed free after the most miserable weekend of my adult life yesterday i came home from the most miserable weekend of my life. my bf and his best friend had quickly planned a camping trip for the three of us plus the friends ex girlfriend. they spent the entire weekend bickering with each other it was extremely nasty and toxic culminating in a screaming match fit for publicfreakouts and them almost actually getting into a physical fight yesterday. i cried every single day this weekend because of their bullshit. we are all stoners though i have been tapering my weed usage for the last 6 months or so and am the only one who can admit that it might be addictive or a problem for any of us. its incredible 1. how much everyone had to smoke to tolerate each other and 2. how nasty and full of rage so called mellow stoners can be. my bfs friend has a total inability to communicate when things are bothering him just acts like everything is fine expects people to read his dissatisfaction from his sarcastic tone and meanwhile he is seething with rage inside from every perceived slight whether real or imagined that of course inevitably bursts. i am just so disgusted with everyones behavior. despite us all being in our 30s 40s i felt like there was not a single adult on the trip. all the while everything is bandaged over with weed. we will all probably never hang out as a group again and all our friendships have been irreparably harmed. yesterday was a turning point for me. despite the high stress situation and it being offered to me constantly all day i didnt have a single hit of weed. i dont want this future. i am not like these people. i do not use weed to make myself numb to a horrible situation. i am learning to deal with difficult emotions with a clear sober head.,anger
i want to go into 2020 as a person who doesnt smoke weed. who else,joy
6 days after 33 years of sobriety this might put things in perspective for some of you. i am 69 years old started smoking weed when i was 18. i had 33 years of sobriety from all substances. then a year ago a pot shop opened 2 blocks from my home. i started with tinctures and edibles to sleep and relaxpretty quickly it progressed to smoking. oh how i had missed that high. at first i convinced myself that this time at this stage in life it would be a good idea to expand my consciousnessto experience a new me. note the pot back in 1969 was no where near as potent as nowadayswe were smoking stems and seeds back then. it took a year of smoking for me to really come around to the reality of my situation. i was totally addicted againafter all these years. i had to start overfrom day 1. i luckily remember all my excellent aa training and know what i need to do. in the absence of good face to face meetings this subreddit has become one of my tools of sobriety. and i know from all those years of sobriety that the number one way to get and stay clean is to help others. i have 6 daysthats 4 more days than someone who is struggling with only 2 days. we have to reach out and help each other. that is how to stay sober. approach the new comerthey need us. even if we too are newcomers ourselves. and by helping those who are struggling we are spending less time worrying about ourselves. 33 years clean and soberaddiction is cunning baffling and powerful. it has infinite patience to wait and kick you in the ass years later. once you know you are an addictyou will always be an addictbut we can be happy recovering addictshelping others and making it easier for those who are struggling by sharing our experience strength and hope. i wish you all the bestif i do not stay sober this time i will drinkand i just do not have the strength at 69 years of age to go through that nightmare again. take careif you think you are not going to make it through today soberplease contact me and i will give you the support i can. you can do thisand you can start over anytimeno matter how many times you have attempted to quit in the past. recovery is a miracle. but we have to nurture itand be kind to one another.,joy
ahhh shit here we go again,anger
i just cant believe its real someone wake me up from this dream 2 weeks without weed after a decade of smoking on daily basis i know that maybe its too soon to celebrate but im 27 years old and been smoking on a daily basis since i was 17 i thought it helped me with depression and ptsd after my parents got sick and eveantually passed away it took some time almost a decade to understand that weed was holding me back from starting an healthy healing process. 2 weeks ago ive been so fucking depressed that i thought to myself weed isnt helping shit today im proud to say that im sober for 2 weeks and ive never felt better my mind is clearer my creativity is already back im enjoying things and even got my precious hobbies back the first couple of days was really hard and even now i think about smoking a little joint every fucking day but the voice of reason reminds me how bad it made me feel. i was on the brink of giving up and now im full of hope and love everybody here you can do it too stay strong life can be so much better for all of us thanks for reading,joy
someone gave a bag for free yesterday after my gig someone gave me a bag of weed for free as a kind gesture for a job well done. i did not know what it was until smelled it. i was at work so i quickly hid it in my pocket and decided id earnt it and would have it when i got home. then an hour later after mingling with everybody. a friend asked me to go to his for a smoke up. i told him i was quitting and gave the weed to him. he said are you sure i said yes and instantly i felt proud of myself. i smoked a cig and had a sip of wine which is not great but i did not smoke weed day 6 whoooooop,joy
please do not relapse today or any other day. its just not worth it. stay strong today.,joy
er trip convinced me enough is enough. long post sorry. ive tried quitting pot before. oh ive tried. ive bagged up my grinders and pieces and fresh bud and thrown them out. ive done it several times. id just go buy new stuff a week later spending even more money. id smoke through the flu making things worse. for the last 8 years i smoked almost every day even after a double hernia surgery. ive spent all of my 20s in a haze. i have a degree in piano and for 7 years ive wasted all the skills i worked so hard to develop. i have stagnated for 8 years on developing marketable job skills. i have spent 8 years chasing a neverending high and playing video games and not improving as a person. my little sister died last year and she knew me as a pothead. shes the only one in my family who knew what i really was. i have held onto that loss so tightly that i feared ever quitting weed because i thought i needed it to retain my sanity and manage my lifelong hypochondria and anxiety. friday night i was not feeling so great and went to bed early. the next morning i smoked a little weed and an hour later my heart began racing and i could not breathe. i thought i was having a heart attack. im perfectly healthy so i was very scared and went to the er. i never ever go to the hospital so i did not even know where to park. the doc told me i likely had an anxiety attack and diagnosed me with pleurisy. my breath is short and its uncomfortable in my chest. it is only mild but any time i tried smoking last week i felt the symptoms it took an er trip to convince me to stop smoking. the last few days have been a nightmare. although tylenol is making the pleurisy much better and completely manageable i am having a hard time adjusting to reality sober. i ca not sit down and play video games because i get bored quickly. no weed ca not sit there for hours playing animal crossing and red dead 2. just ca not think or focus. i want to be high but im a lazy motherfucker who is still dragging himself out of addiction and ca not bring myself to concentrate on active hobbies. i am laying in bed with insane hunger pangs even though i just ate. i cannot remember the last time i was sober this long. i never want to go to the er again. i just want the stomach pangs and discomfort to go away i want my appetite back to normal i want to have a zest for life again. i want to play the piano again and actually learn to enjoy things without weed again. i cannot enter my 30s living paycheck to paycheck doing nothing with my life under the illusion that its fine to just do nothing all fucking day all fucking year long. my best friend just had a kid. i do not want that kid to grow up and be more accomplished than i will be at 50. i want to be free. im on day 3. i realize im addicted. i realize i will always be an addict. but im not going to be a slave anymore. im sick of this shit. it is not worth it anymore. if you read all this thank you. i just need someone to tell me its going to get better. im going to try to go back to sleep now. if you have any advice please give it. sleep and tylenol and bottles of water are my biggest friends. i just tossed out all my paraphernalia again. hopefully for the last time. i can do this. i know i can. edit its the following morning and theres almost 300 upvotes on this and dozens of comments of love and support. this community rules. thank you so much for the support. nighttime is dreadful for some reason. i still have to get up and go to work so im actually thankful for this bit of routine because it will help occupy my mind throughout most of the day. ill check back in over time. much love everyone. edit 2 wow a silver award. thats my first ever reddit award the love just keeps on flowing im stunned. you all are making day 4 such a warm experience. i hope tonight is easier than last nights but it may get worse like some of you said. but i know i can get through this with all your help. edit 3 i wish i could respond to all of you individually. i read every single comment and am taking in every bit of advice. i am going to come out on the other side of this a brand new better version of myself. i will be posting updates over time.,joy
3 years sober today. what ive learned. i smoked from 18 to 24. this is the realization that made me quit ill never be the best version of myself if im high. once i accepted that quitting was easy. addiction is a mindset problem. there may be some physical symptoms but the truth is that you are smoking for a psychological reason. most people love to have an excuse for their short comings. you failed that test because you were high you did not get that girls number because you were high etc. thats what you tell yourself and your friends. when you become sober you have to start to blame yourself for everything and thats hard to do. in the first year of being sober i was desperate to blame other things i would convince myself that i was sick or that my situation was someone elses fault. i went to the doctor like 5 6 times that year. but finally i realized that this was just another mindset problem. be very careful not to develop another outlet for your excuses while finding sobriety because that will lead you down another destructive path. the amazing thing is that when you start to blame yourself for your problems you start to give yourself the power to change. its hard in the beginning but after a year your confidence doubles and it doubles again the year after that. so now 3 years sober i do not even think about weed anymore. i dont even care. i dont need it. and by the way life is 10 times better now than when i was smoking. if you are here on rleaves youve already started to make the right decision. quitting is not easy but its a process and it happens over time. its extremely important to make a commitment to bettering yourself you need to start setting goals and executing instead of quitting and expecting good things to happen. for the first few months i suggest going easy on yourself youre going to be very vulnerable. if you want to watch tv watch tv if you want a cookie have a cookie. do not pitty yourself but instead grow from the pain. spend less time with your friends that are not motivated or hungry for success they probably wo not understand what youre trying to accomplish here. have a dream. one thing that comes with having more confidence is that you start to believe that you can achieve more and more. if you have a dream that you previously thought was unattainable it might not seem so far fetched now. start working towards that. i started by setting myself a ridiculous goal and just grinding towards it to see what would happen when i say ridiculous i really mean pie in the sky ridiculous. well 2 years in and im closer than i thought i would be to my dream becoming a reality the results have been unexpected and incredible. ive become fluent in korean ive learned to juggle ive ran marathons ive learned to code well in at least 5 languages ive launched a business and several side projects met way more girls and more. the more you achieve the more you will achieve and it compounds every year. who knows where i will be in the next 2 years but i can promise you ill be making big moves. that is what keeps me excited every day and seeing myself grow has been a hugely rewarding experience. smoking weed now just seems like such a waste of time and health now. i regret those 6 years that i smoked because if i had put in work 247 instead i would probably own an island by now. look the first few months are hard youre going to have to break yourself down and build yourself back up. but once that happens i promise you wo not ever relapse again. just remember you have the power to do anything you want. the unfortunate thing is that probably only 1 in 100 who read this will understand and start trying to live better. i told myself that i would post a message like this some day to pass on what i have learned. i did not know when but 3 years sober seems like the right time. if i can give at least one person an epiphany then its been worth it. lastly im not saying everything is perfect for me now i still have some struggles and areas on which i want to improve. but all in all i am miles ahead of where i was. to be honest im not even close to the same person i was 3 years ago. totally different. and i know that you are probably going through some horrible situation now and believe me ive been there before too. we are all human. but if not now when and if not us who stay strong. stay safe. never stop. never drop. 모두 제일 좋다 edit thanks for reading if this post made you feel better that really makes me happy. this is just to follow up and answer a few questions. i havent experimented with other drugs. i drink a few times a year socially nothing too excessive. i learned to code online and through friends. i would say i started to feel normal again after about 1 year. i smoked regularly for 5 years though someone who smoked for 20 years would probably take longer. theres going to be some bad days in the first 3 months but its nothing you cant handle. just do whatever you can to keep yourself positive. watch a disney movie listen to only upbeat music whatever. it doesnt matter just avoid negativity at all costs. seriously. im not saying that my issue was the same as yours but in my opinion the majority of people who have an addiction problem with weed have a fear of failure which is rooted in low self esteem you might not even realize it though. being stoned is a great excuse for failing and it feels good too. being high is a safe place. if your blazed out of your mind then you cant be expected to do anything really. and if you keep yourself in a state where you cant execute then you cant fail. you cant win either though. it took me a long time to realize this. smoking weed wasnt the problem. it was a symptom of the problem. get to the root of the issue. blaming yourself is actually a really powerful tool. try to implement it as much as you can. even when other people make mistakes see what you could have done in that situation. dont go overboard but trust me do it for a year and watch how powerful you become. the other key for me was to set goals and complete them. i started by having a list of easy things clean my room make a sandwich etc. and got used to crossing things off. every item you cross off the list increases your self confidence a bit. bigger items yield bigger boosts. keep adding items onto your list and make them gradually harder. make it your mission to execute things every day. every goal you complete makes you better. ive been doing it for 2 years and now im addicted to completing goals. also people used to suggest that i get on medication or see a psychologist but i didnt feel that was the answer for me . you might be different i dont know but i suggest you dont immediately try those and instead see what you can do on your own. you got yourself into this situation you can probably get yourself out. let me just finish by saying that weed is a dead end. you already know this. when i said that my realization made quitting easy what i really meant was it made it inevitable. i had to make a decision. if i wanted to start achieving things quitting was the only option. so then the question became quit now or later the answer to that was easy. youve already decided you want to quit thats why youre here. i would urge you to follow through. i chose to post on this forum because i know you guys are the ones that want to improve. i wouldnt say any of this to the stoners i used to know. life really is a lot better on the other side. hope this helped.,joy
was gifted free weed and almost relapsed sold it and bought food after about 2 weeks clean i was having a rough day and a friend who knew gave me about 20 bucks worth of weed to help me feel better. at first i just put it away in a drawer for a rainy day but i started thinking maybe a couple hits today wont hurt and i almost loaded my pipe and relapsed. instead i sold it to my stoner friend and bought some groceries. many times before i would waste money on weed when i needed other stuff more i had several excuses in my head 1 time wo not hurt i had a rough day so i deserve it i was bored but i overcame all of it and im proud of myself.,joy
simple advice given by an ayahuasca shaman about weed a few months ago i attended an ayahuasca ceremony for numerous reasons but one of the reasons was to heal myself from the damage weed has caused in my self and my life. the ceremony begins with a blessing and a ritual and then everyone drinks their first cup of aya. after about an hour and a half if anyone wants a second cup they can go to the shaman and request a second cup. the shaman gauges how youre feeling and determines if you do indeed need that second cup. i went up for a second cup because i felt comfortable and wanted to deepen the experience. right before he handed me the second cup he paused and said what are you doing here what do you want i told him i was there for a few reasons but as it related to weed i said im hoping that ayahuasca can help heal the damage i believe ive done to my brain from smoking so much cannabis for so long. i feel as if its caused me to become dim witted and slow. ive lost my ability to connect with myself and others. he handed me the second cup and right before i drank it he said before you drink that second cup i want you to think of your situation differently. instead of being concerned about and focusing on all the negative things cannabis has brought into your lifesimply focus on the positive things she brought into your life while you were together. thank her for that. and move on. its a simple yet powerful message. its akin to having an amicable break up rather than having a tumultuous argument and resent filled break up. thank you cannabis for being my companion during the good times. thank you for providing me with spiritual insights creativity and forcing me to question the status quo. i respect you and appreciate what you provided but we both know that we are no longer a suitable match. on to bigger and better things being fully present engaged and alive in this beautiful existence.,sadness
that moment when you are stoned on your bed thinking what the fuck am i doing is when you know. at that exact moment you realise that yes there is something wrong. tomorrow will be the day when i go to sleep sober and wake up clear headed and go around enjoy this drug called life. but then next night you are back at it. the circle continues. but do not get discouraged. you will feel low. you will feel depressed. you will automatically start rolling. but then think about that moment. that moment when laying there stoned you felt helpless and shit and said this is it. hold on to that feeling own that feeling. think about how you never want to feel that way. and let go. just go for a walk. go do something that will take your mind off this. slowly you can and will take back control of your life. 3 months sober and proud. edit 5 months. was not keeping count. had to check my first post on this sub to confirm. you see once you take yourself out of the equation and get used to being sober it becomes a habit. link to my first post.,sadness
i thought weed made me creative 10 days sober and my creative juices are running like a wild fire i want to get so many things done with my life now and have actual goals,joy
a quote from a philosopher that really spoke to me marcus aurelius at dawn when you have trouble getting out of bed tell yourself i have to go to work — as a human being. what do i have to complain of if im going to do what i was born for — the things i was brought into the world to do or is this what i was created for to huddle under the blankets and stay warm so you were born to feel nice instead of doing things and experiencing them dont you see the plants the birds the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks putting the world in order as best they can and youre not willing to do your job as a human being why arent you running to do what your nature demands you dont love yourself enough. or youd love your nature too and what it demands of you. obviously this is about getting out of bed. but i feel like it has a lot in common with what we struggle with here. weed stops us from doing what we need to do. we werent born to simply feel nice. staying in bed all day or getting high are simple short term pleasures that stop us from obtaining more long lasting goals. thoughts on this,joy
am i the only one who smokes to avoid the painshame of being single i have not really been making much of an effort to avoid weed these days but its been about 5 7 days since my last smoke. ive spent each of the past two nights crying harder than ive ever cried before because ive been single for 5 years and the longing to be with someone is just so intense. too intense to live with. i do not know whats wrong with me that put me in this situation. i never could have imagined my life turning out like this. just writing this message is making me feel so fucking lonely and i can feel the tears coming up. the holidays are tough. life is tough. edit i feel so much less alone now guys. i was pretty sure id end up in bed getting high all day but im not gonna do that any more. i hope to keep hearing from you all even if i ca not respond to everyone. we can all do it someway somehow 3,sadness
son there comes a time in a mans life when you put down the bong and focus on whats important ok this is just the dad in me talking to the son in me. not an actual conversation that happened lol. look ive had a lot of fun in my life. ive smoked weed for a little over a decade and had many forgotten unforgettable moments. kind of beautiful really the level of companionship that a shared joint can bring. so ill miss that and i think there will be some mourning involved in acknowledging that that phase is passing. but im technically in my late 20s now. i want to start a family and lean into my potential and be financially secure. i cant do that when im up in the clouds a few times a week. i think ultimately the most concerning side effect of marijuana is that it makes you content with living your average life. yes there are benefits of course and many lessons the plant has to teach but its a double edged sword and it cant be held on forever without hurting your potential. ive attempted a few times to quit but this time feels different.,joy
im proud of myself. i never thought id make it to 6 months but here i am,joy
yesterday i decided to quit today being my 1st day after 22yrs . i just grabbed a snickers from a lady at work this is a sign.,anger
ending my relationship with weed is the best thing i ever did i quit smoking weed for good 490 days ago. i often think about how much easier it wouldve been to give in and just have one more toke. but i didnt. i stuck to it. and now my memory is better than it has been in 7 years. i feel more certainty about who i am what i like and who i like. having a clear head feels pretty damn good both physically and in knowing i made a choice for myself to be better.,joy
one year sober today holy shit. one year and not a single puff of weed. i never thought this day would be possible. i knew for a long time that i needed to stop smoking but i was afraid. i was stuck. i felt like a slave to weed. it was no longer my friend. it was an insidious enemy. i am free of that prison now. i get to choose how i want to spend my time now. i get to have energy and money and healthy food and a clean apartment. i get to be reliable for my friends and my obligations. i get to shower and brush myself instead of passing out in bed. those are all things that i didnt have by the end of my using. happiness consists of genuine interest in your daily activities. and i can say that today i am happy. i take joy in my life. i no longer dread waking up anymore. freedom is possible. sobriety is possible. i didnt do this alone though. thank you to this subreddit. thank you for the posts and comments. i used to read this subreddit while getting high. now i can read it and inspire others. love u all,joy
one whole month replaced my weed habit with a old one reading. this is the first time im finishing a book in over 2 years,joy
1 year off weed alcohol and other drugs im so grateful to be alive. honestly i thought that once i quit that things would get better but it wasnt exactly like that. i would still get depressed for months. i learned that quitting doesnt solve your problems but it does mean that drugs wont make your problems worse. getting and being better requires just as much work as staying sober. life doesnt just take off but im grateful to stay afloat despite the troubles.,joy
got heroin out of my life weed is next i have been clean from all opiates for 16 months and i can confidently say after over 5 years on and off that i genuinely dont crave it anymore. i associate it with death now. i never stopped smoking weed though. the idea that it was helping me cope was a lie i continued to tell myself for a long time. weed doesnt serve me anymore its just a memory of a what i thought was a happier me. genuine positive effects are long gone. heres to day 1,joy
today i am 4 months sober and my life has turned upside down. i first noticed when i was laying in my bed ready to sleep that today is 4 months since i last smoked weed. back then all i did was sitting on my computer day in day out. doing absolutely nothing with my life. i met with some friends ocasionally to smoke some more weed since that was what we had in common. a waste of my life. but at the time i really didnt knew better. it was like i already had given up on my future my dreams my family. it was a vicious circle of feeling bad smoking more. 4 months ago i had a dream. a dream i will never forget. the first dream in many years. i usually never dream when i have smoked weed. but this time i did. i have a son. 1 year old at the time of my dream. he was the one present in my dream. he told me to stop. or else him and mom would leave me. i woke up in tears and was so confused about the whole situation. specially because i know my boy cant speak yet and it was like i heard his true voice for the first time. i stood up took all my weed and flushed it down the toilet. i never looked back. today i have the best relationship with my boy and my girlfriend. i now have my own business producing musicvideoes and commercials. i love it my dream. a dream since i was 9 years old and got my first camera in a present from my dad. i feel like i matter to people now. it is truly strong and a wonderful feeling. i know you can do it as well stop smoking and do what you dream of doing. im so sorry for my rubbish english. i hope it all made sense. have a fantastic day,sadness
day 131 we must all suffer one of two things the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment.,sadness
150 days today. doing well but. . . . . . . . . 150 days without weed today after a 26 year smoking habit. doing well in fact ive seen measurable improvements in all aspects of my life mentally physically and spiritually. my creativity is back. im writing again reading running doing yoga meditating eating well teaching myself to play banjo building things in my little woodshop. my relationship with my wife and kids is also better than ever because im truly present. my wife deserves a sober present husband. my kids deserve a sober present dad which is something i never had growing up. quitting was one of the most difficult and best decisions of my life no doubt im currently in a bit of a heavy mood though which is what brought me here to check in. i guess im still trying to fully come to terms with the idea that i will never toke again. . .that i will never feel the euphoric feeling of filling my lungs with that warm smoke ever again. . .that i will never sit by a campfire again with my best friend and share a joint and good conversation. its the social aspect the ritual of it that i miss the most. the culture behind this drug is so deeply ingrained into my psyche into my identity even. theres a real palpable grief that comes with giving this up like losing a loved one so 150 days ive been to this stage before and beyond a few times actually. the novel excitement of early sobriety has come and gone that pink cloud has blown away. i knew from previous experiences that this would happen so im not surprised by it. it is around this point where i would usually convince myself that next time will be different that now i can moderate my use. not this time though i have to remind myself that im romanticizing the idea of smoking. i have to remind myself that im longing for a skewed version of the past that never really existed. i have to remember that the thought of smoking is far better than the aftermath realities of the relapse high. i have to remember how this drug dulls my intellect wrecks my short term memory damages my lungs disrupts my mental equilibrium interferes with my dopamine uptake system drains my bank account makes me selfish and jacks up my priorities. i have to remember that while it may feel good in the moment it always leaves me feeling empty and unfulfilled. i have to remember that once i start i ca not get enough of it. i have to remember how it takes over my life. i have to remind myself that consuming this drug comes at the cost of becoming consumed by it. i have to remind myself that to gain an ounce of fleeting inauthentic happiness through smoking now is to steal a ton of lasting authentic happiness from my future sober self. i have to fully acknowledge the fact that numbing myself with this drug will only continue to delay my ability to fully address the deep seated reasons why i feel the need to habitually numb myself in the first place. i have to remind myself that its so overrated and simply not worth it stay strong leavers,joy
my grandma asked me are you smoking in there the other day and i was able to say no without lying 😊😭,anger
woo,joy
you know those people who said exercise helps theyre right. i have been struggling so hard to not smoke during the pandemic. ive just felt soblah grumpy lethargic and not my usual self. so i justified smoking several times a week even though i really do not want to and in the past ive let cannabis consume me so i have to be super careful. well i exercised today and yesterday and my cravings were gone my mood was lifted and i was no longer wishing i was high to get through the day. i just felt really good which was a huge change from the day before. im going to keep it up because this is awesome. just thought id share,anger
dogbest friend a man could ever have just died. please give me courage to not smoke and drink myself into oblivion cassidy was her name. had her since first grade im 21. she was the best dog. everyone says their dog is the best but even my friends that had dogs agreed she was something special. friends that had a fear of dogs said she was the only dog they were not afraid of. she was getting old but last night she would not come inside and this morning she was having seizures. i do not live at home anymore. my mom called me and put me on speakerphone and she died right after i told her i love her and i hope she is not in too much pain. we had a very strong bond. i liked her more than most humans. i do not want to smoke today. i do not want to drink today. i finally feel like i am kicking my habit for good. it has been 17 days. ive gone longer before but this time seems real. it has been such a strong coping mechanism in the past when my sister and friend died. help me out yall. here is a pic of my sweet gurl edit thank you all for such kind encouraging words. i will keep up my streak. i wrote a poem for cassidy. might make it into a song eventually. for those who recommend crying do not you worry ive been a sobbing mess throughout the day. here are some more pics. some are with her brother who we lost a few years back. they were such precious pups 3 it was good going back through old memories.,joy
i just realized why im not feeling the satisfaction of quitting id hope id have by now day 107 i spent most of my life from ages 14 20 high. i barely had friends and my grades were dropping. last year i got some bad news about something personal so smoking the feelings away felt like the best way to deal with that. i quit weed right before the beginning of my junior year of college which was 107 days ago. if you had asked me what i think id feel like after 100 days being sober i could not even tell you because thats unimaginable. last year going 4 days without weed was a rare occasion accomplishment. all around im a better version of me than my old sedentary baked potato self. i do not think about weed nearly as much anymore. but stilltheres this feeling of achievement that id thought id have by now and i dont. this made me feel very discouraged throughout the 107 day so far process. last year i had one basic daily routine wake up go to class or dont eat do some homework smoke eat again watch tv go to bed repeat. if i was feeling social id ask my roommate to smoke with me. i was failing a class and i was avoiding all the problems that were happening in my life. sometimes when i got high id lay on the shower floor for a long time. now ive been taking very short showers to save timewater. but i have a cold right now so earlier today i figured id chill in the steamy shower for a bit. while i was letting the water fall on my chest i felt weirdly nostalgic. for a few minutes i felt like last year me laying on the shower floor. and in a way i felt jealous of herbecause she was comfortable. she was okay with the fact that she was literally doing nothing all day. then i had a shower thought literally. i realized why i do not feel achieved. because i am achieving. i am going through an extreme process of change. im becoming familiar with the true sober version of me. i have not made too many friends but i am trying. im not getting amazing grades but im studying. hardest of all i am coping with my feelings. point is that achievementsatisfactionwhatever i was hoping to feel after 100 days is never going to come because i am never going to stop changing. if i had not begun my process of change id be 107 days behind from who i am now and i am currently years behind from who i will be one day. sitting on the shower floor reminded me of my comfort zone that i no longer have anymore. i quit weed because i was not okay with the fact that i was okay doing nothing. i may be far from who i want to be but at least im doing something to get there.,joy
being addicted to weed is like pressing the pause button on your life while time keeps running. only to find out later that you pressed that button for years and youll never get that time back again. this thought suddenly popped up while sitting here high as fuck on a bench all alone outside. i have tried to quit for years and now time really starts counting. i lost friends girlfriends and family who died and it just passed by in a fraction of a second while feeling numb the whole time. not being capable of seeing your family on a regular basis. suddenly theyre gone and you realize that youve spend that whole time high and just threw time away. and most of all all those years of potential and developing yourself dissapeared and you just lag behind and stood still while everyone and everything moved on. personal story im 22 started at 16. ocd from childhood came back hard by smoking that i basically became a hermit. my ocd is about unlucky numbers and rituals freaking out of numbers of the month roughly 23 of the month are unlucky days to quit. put it simple if i quit on those days i feel anxious my ocd literally thinks that someone could dieid not reach my goals if i quit on an unlucky day. even on the normal days i ca not quit because then id avoid beating my ocd. on top of that i also have tinnitus i try to quit literally everyday with cigs and weed and every morning the anxiety starts to kick in hard. it got to the point i dropped out of college and now spend my evenings outside all alone with weed and a beer. hell i even want to quit today but my sister will quit smoking in two days and so i ca not quit because i do not want to associate my quit with hers. this provokes tremendous anxiety to me strangely ocd always finds a way it even got to the point i stole money from my dad just to get weed ride the bike 50 km for a gram. got kicked out for a while i have basically become pathetic. it all started with a suicide attempt at 16 from then on i started sleeping 14 hours a day and throwing years of life away. before anyone asks i get professional help but i just do not feel understood by anyone i always felt different like i did not fit in. its so weird that my ocd is mixed with my addictions. i want to quit when everything is perfect but that will sadly never happen. i managed to quit 3 times for a couple of weeks and felt like a different person its just that this ocd holds me as a prisoner and keeps making me lose so much time and energy just one more thing you guys are one of the greatest recovery subreddits. comments are always so well thought and supportive.,sadness
something that came into my mind while i was high over a week ago youre in no position to decide whether or not you should be high all the time when youre high all the time. that was the last time i smoked. in the days that have followed i have attended inspections for places to rent and had a return contact on an application. ive lived with my mum since seperating from my partner of 12 years treating my depression with weed and doing nothing to fix my situation. cleaned and organised everything within my limited space my room my car and workspace. allowing me to feel in control of what i have left. actually enjoyed my downtime and taking genuine interest in my hobbies. woken up every day feeling prepared for my responsibilities not bracing myself for them. when i was high by myself i would lie to myself. it is not who i am and it is not who you are. listen to that voice listen to your gut its you trying to make contact through the thick haze. thanks for reading.,joy
you are delaying your one life stop the fucking bullshit the best thing ive done for myself was put the devils lettuce down god looking back im so disappointed i even began this fucking habit it doesnt do anything positive for you and does a ton of damage of course i am referring to people who are simply hooked without any medical conditions sure it doesnt kill you but it affects the most important thing the thing that dictates your life the thing that needs to function at its highest capacity to have the life you want your fucking mind ive been off it for 20 days and my god i have 0 interest in going back why the fuck would i want to go backwards in life life is so short you have to make moves to get shit done and all weed did was get in the way of me trying to get shit done look i know weed isnt the worst of drugs but if you are on this fucking reddit page that means weed is affecting your life and deep down you know it you know if you stop this habit your life will be better 10 fold. and believe me it will so do your intuition and soul a favor and listen to it stop the fucking bullshit excuses,joy
today is my 3rd day without smoking weed from almost 4 years of daily abuse and ive felt things i had forgotten i could feel. i know is not much but a month ago i could not even fathom spending a day without weed. but the panic attacks and paranoia were out of control. i completely forgot what was like to be sober. and i know 3 days is nothing i do not want a pat in the back or anything like that. just wanted to share that is not as bad as it seems and is completely possible to achieve. the road to recovery awaits,sadness
how i know i cant moderately smoke 1. it has never worked out before. theres zero evidence to suggest it would be ok now. in fact i am certain it wont. 2. i would put so much effort into moderating and controlling and i would spend all this energy and stress thinking about it to the point where it eclipses the benefits. its honestly easier to just remove weed from the equation altogether rather than trying to make it fit. 3. i love the feeling of weed so much that i dont even know what moderate use looks like. i cant even imagine it now. nights only ill miss wake and bake. weekends only there goes my weekend and personal life. 1 joint a week id be pissed the other 6 days waiting for the next one. and in 5 minutes it will become daily then hourly. honestly i have failed spectacularly at moderation. and i am doing pretty good at recovery. i think i would rather stick it out rather than strike another deal with the devil.,anger
did not smoke when my stoner friends showed up for our weekly weed and monopoly night this post is just to share my progress with someone. its been less than a week of waking up with cold sweats being nauseous and having serious cravings. i knew it would be hard when my friends who are as regular smokers as i used to be showed up to our weekly board game night where we usually indulge stupid amounts of pot. this time however i simply explained to them that i quit and they were super supportive. i even rolled the joints for them went out to the balcony to accompany everyone but only smoked a cigarette myself. i had a beer to balance the scale but that was it. it might seem like a small thing and it probably is but for the first time in half a decade i managed to do what i thought was impossible which is largely thanks to this beautiful community. thank you guys for everything youve taught me and i truly wish you all the best with gettingstaying sober. take care of yourselves ❤️,joy
now is the perfect time to not smoke – regain a clear mind and clear lungs corona virus you do not need the paranoia. you do not need a clouded head. you do not need to be in a daze. you do not need dirty lungs that youll have to cough and hack to clear out. you do not need to puff and pass to other people who may be unwitting carriers. now is the time to let our minds and lungs clear out. you need to be alert. you need to let your lungs heal. you need to not worry every time you feel the need to cough. not trying to lecture anyone ive been telling myself these things as well.,joy
to me weed works as the opposite of the drug from limitless creating consolidated mediocrity. the range of all possible activities and brainpower available to me narrows down to a cycle of eating junkfood and playing video games or bingeing tv shows that i wo not remember. day 2 for the nth time but hopefully breaking the cycle for good.,joy
pediatric nurse here with good news it took 83 days of being clean but i finally passed a lab urinalysis which means i can breathe easier when i finally take my pre employment drug test at the hospital next week its been hard being clean over the last 86 days but as ive stated before my patients deserve me to be at my very best i am so thankful for sobriety today i never thought id get back to where i could pass a lab test much less be mentally healthy without weed. especially since my precious angel of a fiancé still smokes he smoked before me and i never expected him to quit with me thats his own decision to make 😊 i quit cold turkey august 31st while still being surrounded by smokers and weed within an arms reach at any given moment. heres to 86 days of pure strength and will power and heres to finally starting my career as an rn,joy

if you havent tried it yet replace any addiction with physical exercise. i quit the trees and locked myself into a gym membership for year. exercise gets you high and keeps you healthy. game changer. ive quit before. it was 90 days of boredom and being numb. this time i went to the gym. it makes quitting 100 more bearable and enjoyable. and i use to talk shit about gyms or people who work out. give it a shot. i read posts like this for years trying to quit all my addictions before i gave it a shot. was nervous too. happy to answer anyones questions about how to make it a reality if you have mental blocks.,joy
just hit 4 years weed free. feeling sentimental. yesterday marked 4 years since the last time i got high. i wish i knew about this community when i first quit because i used to spend entire days doing nothing but getting stoned and browsing rtrees. i was so positive that weed was not addictive not habit forming is what everyone says that i watched my life fall apart and could not identify that the problem was my using until it was almost too late. flunked out of college got back in flunked out again. ghosted every employer i had. stole thousands of dollars from my parents always promising to pay it back. i smoked all day every day. i was incapable of facing my day without being stoned. the worst part of my day was the split second between waking up and reaching for my weed because that was the only time i had to face my actual feelings and emotions about how much of a mess my life had become. i moved back in with my parents and quit cold turkey. the nightmares the night sweats the panic attacks all came with withdrawal. i also had really bad diarrhea which i now know happens to other people too. i spent a few months living with my parents not responding to any messages from friends asking how i was doing and i finally got so desperately suicidal that i was afraid of what i would do if i could not get high so i asked my parents to send me to rehab. i had no intention of staying sober after rehab. i was just there to figure out my depression and maybe find some tricks for smoking less. i used to be a destructive drinker and i knew i was not going back to that so i saw my smoking as a necessary harm reduction to keep me from blacking out and really hurting people. maybe i could go to some aa meetings and pick up some wisdom from people whod been through worse shit than me. i know twelve step is not for everyone and i really did not like it at first. i could not get past the god stuff. i felt like a fly on the wall at aa meetings because even though i might have drank alcoholically in college i did not stay up at night thinking about getting drunk. i fantasized about when id get high again. then by sheer luck the drug guy at my rehab told me there was a marijuana anonymous meeting within walking distance of the rehab residence. he told me it was a small group one of only two in my state but it was right there. a lot of twelve steppers would call this a godshot or some shit like that but i do not see it that way. i just really fucking lucked out. my first ma meeting was a revelation. a lot like finding out this community existed probably was for a lot of you. it turned out i was not insane. i heard my exact story told back to me from people i had nothing else in common with. things that were private sources of shame for me became shared experiences. i thought i was the only person in the world who played games with his stash setting rules about when i was allowed to get high and inevitably breaking them. so i kept going. still would not say im name and im a marijuana addict because i was not ready to admit that. just name and im a stoner at first. then i got closer with people in the program and started working with a sponsor. a dude about my age who seemingly lost everything and picked it back up. my life got better. i stayed in the city where my rehab was. i finished my last 4 college classes here and transferred them back to my old school and graduated. i held down the same job for three years until covid hit the longest id kept a job before that was maybe six months. ive spent the last four years with varying levels of commitment to the program sometimes going to two meetings a week sometimes not going for months. since the pandemic hit all the meetings have been on zoom which makes it easy for me to hit multiple meetings a day. i work an agnostic program with an agnostic sponsor and i sponsor two guys. since my state legalized in january the rooms have exploded with newcomers and we need all the help we can get. it matters so much to me that people understand some of us are not wired to smoke casually. the weed is so potent now and for some people like us it just hits the perfect spot of euphoria and detachment. if weed affected all my friends the way it affected me they would have had to quit too. it makes me furious that people are still suffering out there under this idea that their habit or addiction is not taken seriously and i want to do everything i can to break that silence. im so glad you guys exist and my dms are open if anyone wants to talk. 3,sadness
smoked after 213 days. to anyone considering going back read this. 213 days ago was the last time i had smoked weed until tonight. in the past three weeks i slowly but surely got back into the mentality of ill just try it once to see romanticizing the hell out of it. and within 5 minutes i was filled with regret. not only because of the fact that i broke by streak but because it was very far from enjoyable and not at all what i expected it to be. it made me realize i love having a clear mind and it may be tough to realize at times just how precious being sober is but i really do believe its better than any drug. some of you might be out there considering going back very heavily weighing out the reasons but i promise its not worth it. i didnt even smoke that much and was left feeling extremely antisocial and self conscious forgetting what was being talked aboutwhat i was going to say feeling plain stupid and unable to keep track of the conversations that were being held. i think its gotten to a point where my body has just been there and done that. its not special to me any more. to all those of you out there reading this i promise you that you will grow to like being sober and having a clear mind you just have to persevere and trust not only the process but also yourself fully at all times. once you see it weed is nowhere near as fun as it used to be and is a waste of an opportunity to be sober and truly capture and embrace whatever moment you are in. the idea that it will make you feel good is nothing but an illusion because either youll regret it later or right away. in a way im actually glad i smoked because i now truly see that my body is over weed. smoking over 2000 times made it become old and bland. i promise to every single one of you that the grass is greener on the other side and that most importantly you can do it. have faith in yourself. appreciate having a clear mind and being sober because it truly is precious. thanks for reading this. if theres even one person out there i can convince not to smoke ill be more than happy. take care and be the best version of yourselves that you can be.,anger
watching my husbands stoner buddies reminded me why im holding strong 81 days sober although the temptation still lingered this isolation with my two super active kids has been a challenge and a half. i hadnt had too many cravings the past couple weeks but the urge has been strong the last couple days. you know get stoned and spring clean. get stoned watch a kids movie. get stoned and be comfortable with this chaotic world. last night my husbands buddies came over. eyes cashed out and that hu hu hu stoner laugh. watching them pig out on dinner then starting passing out reminded me why im sober. my kids deserve better than that. when they asked if i wanted to join in a toke they were surprised im still sober. but then again i cant blame them. i was an all day everyday productive pothead. but the key word is was. sober 2020 regardless of what happens in the world.,joy
they know all i can do is sit back and chuckle. moments before i was in disbelief. my mom comes into my room and asks hows it going. i said im cool at my desk working remotely. she asked me when im going to discuss what im going through with her. long story short she knew when i was smoking she knew when i quit. she knew when i slipped and now she sees im miserable and suspects im quitting again. shes like your old apartment smelt like weed. when you moved home i do not know what you were smoking cause it did not smell dabs but i know you were getting high. i was shocked and immediately started to cry. she said she knows im private and wanted to give me space but she thinks its time to talk about it. you guys who are fortunate to have loved ones who care they really do care. life happens they just want you happy and healthy. i think my journey will be easier now i have her support and i can talk to her about my cravings etc.,joy
today is 3 months 100 smoke free. i just got accepted into college. ive accomplished more in the last 3 months than i have in the last 5 years since i graduated high school. unreal. i feel so alive.,joy
reminder your brain chemicals need time to reset weed didnt make you more productive or fix your anxiety or depression. friends i know how hard it can be to wake up with the anxiety the low mood the lack of motivation. i know the first thought when feeling these things is something like wow if i smoke i am so much more productive or whatever — im here to remind you that is a false choice. weve been flooding our brain with an influx of chemicals e.g dopamine and its going to take time for our brains to adjust to a normal level again. trust the process trust your bodys ability to heal itself. it will get better. stay strong.,joy
day 360 just got accepted into med school almost threw away one year of sobriety. hey guys i am typing this on mobile so apologies if i make some typos. i made a few posts here quite a while ago about my story why i quit and little updates during the first few months without weed. i just wanted to share with you guys that today i got the confirmation that i got accepted into med school and also that i have my 1 year anniversary coming up. honestly months 1 11 were surprisingly easy. i barely had any cravings and sobriety quickly became the new normal. in july i took the entrance exam for medical university here in austria after studying really hard for 3 months straight. honestly after the exam i had the horrible feeling that i fucked it up and soon after my self destructive tendencies came up again. i began drinking beer on my own and playing video games all day. after a week of that i went back to my home city to spend some time with my mum my cats and my girlfriend. while i was there i also began hanging out with my deadbeat stoner friend again who also was my hookup back in the stoner days. he was ripping his disgusting bong weed mixed with rolling tobacco while i was sipping beer and watching him cough up half a lung after every hit before he slipped into the somnolent haze that is the marijuana high. after a few days of saying no and declining his offers of smoking eventually i caved and when he told me he was gonna go pick up i pitched in with a 20. honestly i felt wrong and bad about it while i said it and while i was waiting for him to return. deep down i did not really want to get high again. deep down i really did not want to disappoint my girlfriend who had been so supportive and proud of me quitting. yet i said nothing. when he came back me and him had a little falling out. he was with some friend of his and i think he wanted to show to his friend that he could boss me around or belittle me or something. he was high as a kite and trying to play some mind games with me. after a minute or two of arguing i said fuck this im out and went back home. i let him keep the 20 bag and just walked home. on the way home i felt so so happy i did not partake. i felt really reaffirmed in my decision to abstain and also thankful that he decided to be a petty dick that day because if he had not i would have definitely relapsed. so today i got the email that i passed finishing 71st out of 5000 people and on friday i will go to the university and officially enlist. after years of fucking around and achieving nothing of substance except substance abuse i finally have a clear goal and career path in front of me and that is to become a great fucking doctor. thank you guys for reading and i wish every single one of you all the best. we are all in this together.,anger
smoked almost everyday since i was 16. im 24 now. made it past 30 day marker. just got back from the gym.,anger
smoking because youre lonely being lonely because you smoke. does anyone else ever fall into this toxic cycle i find that if i am regularly smoking i dont put in any effort into socializing and spend my free time being high instead. as a result i lose touch with people and have no one to talk to or spend time with so i smoke to feel better and have something to do. the worst is when you finally stop smoking and are left with the consequences but have no cushy vape pen to make it feel better. thankfully i only smoked for a couple months this time i had made it like 10 months before i started up again. this should be much easier than when i stopped after smoking for years. this is the first time ive decided to stop smoking before anything bad happened usually i dont stop until something bad happens but my grades are still really good and my new job is still going well. im stopping to keep it that way and to work on other areas of my life.,joy

a month ago i took a break and had never been happier. i went back to daily usage and became apathetic again. we all want to be happy heres some advice. turn it around right now. stop waiting till tomorrow. ive been a reddit ampampamp leaves lurker for years but i felt the need to share. a month ago i quit for 10 straight days and even within that short span of time i was a much happier person. the only way i got through this break was by constantly distracting myself and by relocating. i left nyc and visited family in d.c i am able to work remotely and needed to get away from the concrete jungle. before i left for d.c. i planned on getting stoned for the uber to penn st. the amtrak to d.c. and the uber to the house. i wanted nothing more than to be stoned while watching something on my laptop or playing some games on my switch. unfortunately i was in an absolute frenzy to get to my train as i had gotten busy with my remote work and had not finished packing procrastination. i hurried my ass down to penn station but the entire way there i was fuming that i could not get high for the trip. pathetic. i purposely did not bring anything to d.c. not able to use it around family and not going to sneak around. withdrawal kicked in quickly. i could not sleep. i was an anxious and restless mess. i was irritable. i was pacing around. i was dealing with both physical symptoms and a psychological war. here was my formula to combat this activity working from 8am 4pm. walks with the dog. basketballshooting around. running. walking. movies. tv. books. reddit. anything. keep yourself busy. if youre bored think about what you used to enjoy as a child and just run with it. i started drawing with pens ampampamp colored pencils again. exercise i redirected this energy into exercise. i do not lift weights but i played basketball by myself for hours in the brutal heat nearly every single day. i love shooting around it is truly cathartic for me. i also refrained from heavy alcohol usage while i was on this borderline vacation. i also out of nowhere picked up running after having gone on some long walks with the dog. find something to do. positive self talk i admittedly talk to myself aloud a lot and inner dialoguethoughts are always running. instead of being so hard on myself as i always am i decided id treat myself with respect. stop calling yourself stupid and stop saying im such an idiot. start talking yourself up. think positive i am an admittedly cynical person and this doesnt help during a pandemic. however i needed to keep telling myself that this fight is worth it. i forced myself to smile. i stayed away from social media. i stayed away from the news. i removed myself from my settingenvironment whenever the vibes in the room went south. relocation i needed a break from nyc. it has been a dreary and draining experience here especially living blocks from a hospital. when this all began the sirens did not stop. i needed to escape my smoking den. relocation has always been key to my breaks. try to get away if possible. socialization with non smokers this is obviously a tricky one at the moment but social interactions are key to shifting around our moods. think about a time you were with a negative person. how did you feel afterwards now think about a time you were with a charismatic and cheerful person. how did you feel afterwards the results by 10 days the negative effects from withdrawal completely wore off and i found myself to be in a genuinely happy place for the first time since a small getaway to ct. in may. i took the subway back up to my apartment and i was the only one on the subway car that was visibly happy. i was bopping to the hamilton soundtrack having watched it while on that trip. i was smiling. people were looking at me like i had 10 heads why i understand we are in a crisis and everyone is going through their own shit. life is tough. but we must remind ourselves that our time is going to come and must focus on the present. this break made me more appreciative of life in general. recent relapse i smoked that evening when i returned to my tiny apartment and did not stop. i recently took a tiny 5 day break without relocating but caved yesterday evening after an incredibly stressful day of work. i enjoyed myself and am not going to be mad at myself for this slip up. this morning this morning i got up at 830am and around 900am got out of bed and immediately saw a bowl with a tiny hit id be able to snag. i told myself last night i would start over in the morning but as i usually do i said fuck it and torched the bowl a few hours ago. i am not upset with myself but a little disappointed. takeaways this is not easy and is going to take time. but unlike in the past i have told myself i am going to stop again right now. no more ive already smoked today so whats the difference if i smoke a little more later no more oh today is the 29th. ill only smoke a little bit the next few days and start over on the 1st of september. nope not happening this time. i have realized that refraining from usage will make me a happier and more productive person. i hate being an apathetic being on the couch. i may have slipped up a few hours ago but i also have been successful the past few hours. i only took one hit and did not repack. i immediately knew i made the wrong decision. but guess what we live in the present. i smoked in the past. stop putting it off and just start now. the long term benefits are undoubtedly better. lets stop denying this and stop letting our past hurt our present and future. have a great day everyone,joy
i hate that people who have not experienced weed withdrawals do not think its real title says all so many people around me that think i am exaggerating about not being able to eat as much or being drained the entire day. they do not even know the half of it. after 5 years of daily smoking and no breaks im 5 days into the journey to sobriety. edit thanks for all the upvotes guys this has been one of my first posts on reddit ever and this community is awesome and so supportive. im really glad i made an account thanks to all of you. everyone has a different journey and i hope we all make it till the end we just have to power through and remind ourselves why we quit in the first place.,sadness
relapse is a normal part of the quitting process but at some point if the spaghetti never sticks to the wall we need to re evaluate our cooking method. . . . . . . 191 days in and i feel for the first time in my 26 years of smoking that this thing is sticking. im staying vigilant though because i know from so many past experiences how that noodle that seemed so mummified to the wall yesterday can suddenly and inexplicably fall today. ive been actively trying to quit for the past 11 years of my 26 year smoking habit. at this point along my long path of sobriety i can no longer consider my relapses as learning experiences. ive had more than my fair share of learning experiences over the years. ive broken far too many promises to myself and my wife about quitting. its time as the weird saying goes to shit or get off the pot. im done shitting on my vows of sobriety so the time has come to permanently get off the pot. haha pun intended. ive finally made peace with the idea that i will never smoke weed again and feel strongly that achieving this state of mind is key to getting that slippery noodle that is sobriety to permanently adhere to the wall. how to achieve that state of mind well were all different but for me it took years of struggling and the guilt and suffering that goes along with that struggle to realize paradoxically that the struggle itself was actually causing me to fail. we can only pull on a rope for so long. eventually we need to just release let go and accept the fact that weed no longer serves us in any positive way. it is at this critical juncture that giving up weed feels less like a great loss or sacrifice and more like the opportunity that it truly is to begin the process of attaining the more substantive and meaningful life which we all desire. time to go for my early morning jog . . . something that my former stoner self never did big love leavers,joy
major props to all of you who have gone 12 hours free 24hrs48hrs weeks months years ive been a user of cannabis for 24 years with a couple of breaks longest one being 9 months. i felt that was some of the happiest times of my life i was for once confident and just walked with my head high. one day while being sober i lied to myself and said i can smoke a couple hits and that will be it. well i tried and it came back full force now ive been trying to quit for the last couple years and every time its one more sack one more hit this will be the last one i swear. i can only go a few hours without taking a rip i feel sad and pathetic that i ca not give it up even knowing that one time being sober was the best feeling. i want that back but its just hard i read your stories and it gives me hope that one day i could be free again. positive vibes take care peace,sadness
i quit in 2019 heres how it went last year my resolution was to stop smoking pot. id been constantly high for nearly 25 years. wake and bake. smoke a lunch again mid afternoon then before going home then again after dinner. you get the point. it was tough going. the first two or three weeks were the toughest. i had little energy. i was in a shitty mood. i doubt i was fun to live with. i told myself constantly that if i just smoked again id be fine. but i realized that voice in my head was wrong. i ignored it and moped through the first three weeks of the year. then started feeling better. a lot better. i felt smarter. i realized i was more present. i forced myself to reconnect with friends and to make new connections with other people in my neighborhood. i told myself i was cured then smoked a little in feb. the plan was moderation but that didnt happen. i had to go through shorty withdrawal feeling again. i treated that same cycle again in the summer. then i stopped like for real. now i nearly never crave it. like where youre consumed with it can can think of nothing else. however i still think about smoking nearly every day but its like a passing thought. like remember how i used to always smoke before x. cant encourage you all to stay on the path. if you stopped on new years stick with it. my marriage is better. my life is better. im making more money and am generally happier. you can be too. and the real kicker i used to say i need to smoke to calm down. eventually i realized that im more calm now that i dont smoke and a lot of the stuff i was coping with was due to weed not solved by it. hope you find out the same thing. shout out to everyone on this sub. huge help.,joy
so fucking scared to do this. literally tears of terror are in my eyes as i type right now. i need to stop smoking to get my life together. im 31 now and had my first toke at 14. the next day i became a daily user who was proud to only have missed about 3 weeks of smoking over the past 17 years. i grew up with weed i grew up high all the time. getting high at my private unisex high school during lunch and again otw home. wake n bake in the car otw there the next morning. point is i made it all through high school high graduated with a 3.6 gpa high af played varsity sports a little high and started taking my talents for granted. meanwhile i am teaching myself to play music. formin a rock band from my peers we smoked out every practice. in fact i remember the bass player leaving bc we were getting high instead of practicing. weed became part of the very fabric that held my life together. there were no emotions in high school after weed. i convinced myself i made better music when high. and if you study high and take the test high you get high grades like the drunken call back in beerfest the movie. then hurricane katrina hits my city in my senior year. mass devestation lose every possession except for 2 guitars and a bag of hand me down trinkets my great grandfather had given me. evacuate to a smallish town. great wheres the weed guy here i quickly found the source in my new town. so i make it to a party. find the pot heads blow down. rinse and repeat until graduation. also started using ecstasy pretty heavily until graduation summer before college come back to hometown rebuild with my parents. well partially until i realized i couldnt get high in the fema trailers with everyone else around so i left and went to stay with a friend and his parents. wtf who fucking does that 18 yo and like nah mom and dad i cant live i such cramped quarters. i was a little ungrateful bitch. that didnt have the tools to deal with emotion. most of high school is a fuzzy blur. i remember faces and some names but again its all very unclear. at this point you are probably thinking i am a total burnout but the truth is i am still functional. or at least i was until college started. get to university for orientation. find pot heads get high miss all entrance exams. have to take remedial classes which ultimately caused me to take summer classes later to graduate on time. more on that later. the rest of college is filled with memories of bright lights drunk nights and heartbreak. year 1 of university i meet my first really serious girlfriend. we smoked took some molly woke up naked alongside each other. couldnt remember her name or where we were. but holy shit there was a naked chick in my bed and that had not happened before i love college we start dating she takes xanax like its prescribed. went through 5 years of what i now call pain management. we were toxic for each other. couldnt have a good time unless we were both high. her family loved me so that counted for a whole lot. especially bc i kind of black sheepd myself in my family. so i was seeking validation from her parental units and not even conversating with my own. especially her dad. he was a cool s.o.b. worked as a top dog for a barge company on the river . but it wasnt because he was cool i have come to realize i wanted his support more than the rest of the family because my bio dad left before i was born. so i have been trying to fill this hole in my soulheart whatever using everyone and everything but myself to overcome it. her and i break up. it was a critical point in my life the first time i though weed might be the prlblem and not the cure nah fuck that toke it up fuck that bitch amirite i cant remember shit anymore. we are now in post graduate working life. i take the first job offer that doesnt test for pot youre looking at the newest most promising salesman to step foot into a guitar center. really 4 years of music education and you go into retail sales not what i expected to do. but lets be real. i never had ambition or goals at the time because i had been high for the better half of a decade. so i work there for 5 years start looking how to get out. meet an old friend at gc who tells me his job is hiring. 80 bucks and a fake urine sample later i employed at a warehouse counting boxes all day guess what makes that more fun you got it. weeed until you drop all the ketchup from the top shelf because you hit the gas and not the break on the forklift. so i started slowing down smoking. 1 time a day. that lasted about 2 years before i left and started a new job. i moved on to work as a service writer in a body shop. chasing a bigger check. bc at this point i realized i am too far removed from university to go back for something else boy was i wrong so lets move forward with people who will train me today i am a car salesman i went from having all the potential in the world to car sales and most of how i got here is a blur. i dont work out anymore bc i am at work between 10 and 11 hours a day now and not really making money. i cant take any well paying technical jobs bc i have a music degree and still piss dirty. and on top of all that my 2nd serious relationship in life ended 3 days ago. i am in therapy once a week now and i can see how it will benefit me in the long run. but i cant help but feeling like weed is a major roadblock in my life. since her and i broke up i have only been able to eat and sleep with the aid of weed. but i ca not think. so i sober up a little to make it through the day and then the emotions crush me. literally leave the office to go bawl my eyes out in the car. she says that its not about weed or anything related to it since she smokes too but i can definitely see how it caused issues in the relationship. by the time lunch comes around im looking for my oil pen every god damn day. i just want to be able to be sober and make real connections with people again. think through a problem and have it solved. ive spent half of my life in a fucking fog. no wonder why nothing seems beautiful anymore and why i long for the feeling we get as kids when you see something dreamy and it gives you hope that your life could be that beautiful. my life has had its own beauty but it also hasnt really been my life. that wasnt me making decisions i was hiding behind the shell of a 20 something year old. todays the day fam. today is day 1. ive got the chills just typing that out. fuck theres power in admission. heres to a better future. and if i can do this. you can do this. edit to the kind soul who thought my words hold a monetary value. i cant tell you how much i appreciate the gold and the comforting words waiting on the other side. 2nd best decision i have made all year was to open up to a bunch of strangers on reddit. best decision was to get clean and deal with my emotional stresses. thank you all. i am here for you too. dm if you want to talk. 2nd edit platinum yall are too much. just read it. let it resonate. know youre not alone. and most of all we have to remember we are bettering ourselves. and thats the reason to quit,joy
shoot i missed it clean for a year and a day i was adamantly waiting for the 26th to post my one year blurb. just checked my app and heh it was actually yesterday so although a bit late heres my one year post on what its been like. people seem to think life will be so much better if we just get clean. to that i promise you it absolutely is now life is not all sunshine and roses i still have some bad days but its amazing how much better things are overall. my bad days are better and my good days are gooder. the money ohh the money i have a savings account now im no longer in overdraft or taking payday loans im starting to save for retirement according to my app ive saved at least 2000 and thats the bare minimum. thats for a less than average day of using not including splurging on something extra. thats just on maryjane not including the lifestyle of takeout food and needless taxis. thats not including the extra shifts ive picked up from work and not calling in because im just not feeling it or i accidentally got too high before work. money can be a powerful motivator and i promise you more will come your way if you stay clean. i still have problems. im still socially anxious. i get a hit of fomo when people go to spark up. i get the occasional craving either walking by the dispensary or just feeling a little off like a toke would help with that. but after years of trying to get clean ive finally realized a toke will not improve anything. ill get a head rush a quick hit of dopamine then sabotage myself for the remainder of the day. not to mention reigniting that craving cycle all over again. its just not worth it. no matter what i choose to stay clean. for those still in the thick of things going through the severely misunderstood issues of marijuana withdrawal stick with it no matter what youre going through a toke will not help at least not in the long run. melatonin and meditation for sleep fruits and smoothies for something to eat and i hear working out helps substantially. do not be afraid to reach out to us here weve all got your back in this ongoing battle. together we can do what we ca not do alone. tldr officially over a year clean lifes gotten much better it will for you too. edit thank you for the kind comments and awards its really appreciated,joy
if you havent relapsed today you are a strong person. if you stay strong for another day you will be stronger than yesterday. and for those who relapsed you will be stronger the next day if you take something away from this relapse. have an excellent 4th and good luck.,joy
clean and sober. id like to share my story. i am a dutch woman of 65. i started smoking hashies when i was 14 and did so for 44 years. i would always say i was not addicted because i did not smoke when i was on holiday. needless to say i always found people to smoke with. but the last years of my life long habit i was very bored with it. i smoked all day and was bored. finally i found the opportunity to go into rehab and i did and after the first three weeks in which you are supposed to stop i stopped. it was very very hard. i could not sleep my mind was running but everyone assured me it would get better. and also the times i wanted to smoke would pass. i believed them. they were right. i was so afraid to stop but there was nothing to be afraid of. i love to have a clear head. i am so happy i stopped. it has been 8 years now. i have never longed for a smoke. never want that feeling of being stoned again. thanks for reading.,sadness
365 days free from weed i made it to the one year mark today. before quitting i never thought id be able to live without weed but here i am. it has definetly gotten much easier over time tho i still get the occasional craving. id just like to thank you guys for being a source of inspiration. thats all.,joy
im ending my abusive relationship with mary jane. at first she was a really good friend. she made me happy made me laugh and smile told me i was the best guy in the world. years later her whole attitude changed. she tells me im a piece a shit im worthless she makes me lethargic and depressed she takes all of my money and took all of my friends away from me. she gets me upset sometimes and since im too much of a pussy to take it out on her i take it out on the people closest to me. no more i say marijuana you broke my heart you bitch so im breaking up with you and im dating your cousin,sadness
35yo smoked nearly daily since i was 18. today is my first serious day one without finding this sub is what inspired me. thanks,joy
got in i ca not believe this ive gotten into acting school with a scholarship they said that my audition was one of the best theyve seen and im meeting with deen next week i never ever would have applied in the first place if i was still smoking i really lost sight of my dreams when i started and now i can see them slowly coming back into view. if you want it you can do it i would not have been able to do any of this if it was not for this group and im just so thankful for everything. do not give up and if you want to start do it i promise you will not regret it. edit oh my gosh thank you so much everyone for the kind words i do not have any friends so this really means a lot i feel so much love ♡♡♡,joy
to all leavers there are so many terrific people here who keep the forum up and running you all deserve some thanks from another group. this is a group to which i belong the sleeperscreepers. were here intermittently throwing an upvote someones way but more often than not we just read what everyone else is saying if its been a tough week we might be pushed into posting something. were not generally the people who help and give advice in these posts. personally i can never find the right words. my thoughts always seem too personal to help anyone else out. thankfully there are others out there. those of you who are able to turn your experiences into reports which can help other people through difficult times. thank you for doing this. its such a relief to have a community to return to. to think about cannabis a couple of times in a day go onto reddit and see that im not alone that none of us are. without all your constant work this place would not exist so on behalf of the people who ca not bring themselves to do it but find solace in the company of others thank you in all sincerity.,joy
quitting smokebecause im going to be a dad in one of the most unexpected but humbling twists of the m. night shamalamadingdong movie that is my life we found out we were expecting 4 days after we got married. total accident. it has been tough we just moved cross country for a new job that did not turn out to be all it was hyped up to be but weve been there for each other all the way. i used mj just about every night after work to either relieve stresstensionanxiety or just for fun but its time to clean the pieces and put them away. ive got a new set of responsibilities now. and i ca not fuck this one up boys its not the same as remembering the joint pass rotation order wish me luck. ill smoke again whenif my kid finds out about it and is old enough. i smoked with my dad a couple times its not weird as long as everybody is an adult about it. and we live in a recreational state so the culture will be around its a girl our first.,joy
with weed you get stuck doing the same things for years. back to day 1 again. need this post for myself when i am feeling weak. i realized last night ive been doing the same shit get home smoke watch a movie play video games repeat for 3 years. ive managed to secure a good job in my field and lead a successful life but dam. outside of work everything has stood still for 3 years. i havent gotten better at anything not work related and it depresses me. i dont pick up my guitar i dont explore the neighborhood i havent picked up any new skill nothing. so please dont let this happen to you rage hard against doing the same thing for years and letting your life just stand still and grow best of luck to you all. never forget addiction is real. love and hugs to all of you,sadness
i thought i had damaged my brain long time lurker first time poster here after smoking daily for 27 years i decided to give up last august and here i am 195 days since my last joint. however im not here on a victory lap to bask in my wonderful achievement though i am proud of myself i must say. its more to offer reassurance to those who feel they may have caused irreparable damage to their brain and their capacity to learn new things. this was a real concern to me prior to quitting my short term memory was fucked and my capacity to retain new information was seemingly non existent. i knew however that if i was to successfully quit for good i would need to replace my one and only hobby getting stoned sad but true with something else so i decided that i would study spanish 28 years since i studied it in school. fast forward through the nightmare of the initial few weeks of withdrawal symptoms mainly horrendous insomnia coupled with crushing anxiety. i finally sat down to study spanish having previously been able to speak to a fairly decent level b2 i was shocked at just how much i had forgotten. to the extent that i had to relearn using duolingo. however within a few weeks of studying and further sobriety it all came flooding back but i guess it stands to reason that i had not forgotten it was just laying dormant. what has really surprised me though has been my capacity to learn new vocabulary and new grammar. i estimate that i have learnt in the region of 500 words in the last 6 months in additional to learning more advanced grammar. i am now able to watch and follow spanish tv every evening. something a year ago i would have thought impossible. my brain was not damaged is not damaged it was just being held hostage for 27 years so my message to those of you who feel you have lost the capacity to learn to advance yourself and to reinvent yourself you really havent trust me your brain is absolutely fine its ready and waiting for your motivation to come along and wake it up and achieve whatever you want to achieve break that stockholm syndrome. good luck,anger
this may be an unpopular opinion but the easiest part about quitting weed is abstaining from smoking. said to me from my substance abuse counselor whos been practicing for 40 years. after thinking about it some i tend to agree with her. aside from the physical withdrawal the hardest part is finding a new way to live changing habits discovering new ways to spend time and energy developing new interests and tackling underlying mental health issues. its been just over 5 months for me and i can see how ive failed to call it quits in the past. i never put any effort into changing my life beyond just not smoking. so this is a reminder to pay attention and nurture all different aspects of yourself. deal with ghosts from the past. fill your new free time with positive things. its a hard journey but its worth it,joy

day 20. found a nug while cleaning i put it aside and walked away. going to go for a run.,joy
4 months today and no one to tell its been 4 months since my last puff. the only person who knew about my addiction was my wife so shes also the only one who knows about my success in regards to quitting. feels good edit thank you so much for all of the support edit 2 im a female and i feel that there are less females who are addicted to pot so the judgments are even harsher. thats another reason that i never really told people about my addiction.,joy
what moment made you realize you needed to stop smoking pot for me it was when i took my boyfriend to visit my hometown for the very first time. show me all the places you hung out he said. well i could show him a parkwhere i smoked a lot. or another parkwhere i smoked a lot. or the parking lot where i ate mcdonalds by myselfafter i got stoned. or the apartment where i hung out with a older drug dealer all day to smoke for free even though i was sexually harassed by his friends constantly. looking back my life completely vanished once i turned 16. everything and anything involved smoking weed getting weed and dealing with the high. before then i was a starting varsity lacrosse player with good grades and genuine friendships. that all vanished once i started smoking. now im 24 the same stoner as before with nothing interesting to share. weed makes you boring and dull. today i threw away all my pieces. 7 days clean. what moment made you realize you had to stop,sadness
ask yourself — why do i feel the need to continually alter my reality with weed what is it about my reality that im trying to escape then set about putting in the hard work creating for yourself a reality which needs no chemical alteration. for me this has been focusing on my overall health and wellness . . . physical mental spiritual. its important to recognize the connection between these three. they like the three legs of a stool depend upon each other for overall stability. healthy eating exercise meditationyoga . . . these are the three legs of my stool. speaking of its 430 am time to sit in quiet meditation then do a little yoga then go for a run then eat a healthy breakfast. then go to work feeling energized and rejuvenated. im a 41 year old male and i smoked for 26 years. i quit drinking 11 years ago as i also had an alcohol addiction. i thought for a very long time that i needed marijuana to cope with my anxiety and depression though i finally realized that it was ultimately making these conditions worse. im currently 7 months weed free. do i still miss smoking yes sometimes. but the cravings are getting fewer and further between. its amazing how much clearer my mind is. i didnt even realize the fog id been living in. i dont want to go back. my kids have a completely sober and present dad now something i didnt have as a kid. my wife has a completely sober and present husband. shes proud of me. im proud of myself for the first time in a very long time. i feel light and free and genuinely happy and content for once. sobriety is feeling pretty darn good. you can do it too if you really want to,joy
has anyone else found that theyre better at eye contact when theyre sober its a small thing but ive realised that im much better at it. when i would answer the door to delivery drivers or go to the shop or something whilst high id always overthink about how much im looking at the person or just straight up avoid it. thered be times when id leave and realise that i had no idea what the person i just interacted with looked like because i completely avoided looking at them. now i can look them straight in the eyes without anxiety smile and tell them to have a nice day without overthinking or panicking about it. i did not know how much weed changed me until i stopped smoking.,joy
wrote this on my hand to fight the cravings and depression,anger
its not about quitting its about adopting a new life style. if you focus on not doing weed but you really still want to then you are still focused on weed and itll be difficult to sustain. instead seek out a new life a new lifestyle. most people do not smoke weed. we do not need it weve just convinced ourselves that we do. our brains and its thoughts are powerful and have the ability to keep us hooked or free us. we just need to figure out how to tap into that. its a simple concept and one that is not easy to implement. were all born with all the tools we need to cope. they get rusty over time while were using weed and not using them. once we stop with intent to do better they start to function again. we also develop new tools along the way. relapsing is not a joke or something to be experimented with. if you had been addicted a relapse is playing with fire and once that boundary is broken down its real easy to fall back into your old patterns.,joy
today is my one year anniversary of quitting smoking weed dear adorable striving hopeful desperate lucky leavers if i could do it so can you i smoked regularly for 5 years grew a huge crop in my backyard sold weed and had over a pound of bud in the house when i decided no more. i was so miserable and depressed the year before i quit. i finally quit on feb. 11 2019. it was not easy. i had a few relapses on edibles during the past year but each time i realized how sucky weed is for me. i am so so glad that i quit i am no longer as depressed anxious hopeless and stuck. i am exercising more im stronger physically and mentally im present optimistic and hopeful. im so grateful for the support i received along the way. if you have any doubts that your weed use is holding you back i urge you to take the journey i did and quit. quit today. cold turkey. throw it all away. you are not a stoner you are a leaver love to all. julie s. oakland california,joy
i used to struggle every day. today im 1 year sober. i used to smoke every single day for 7 years and in the final 2 years or so grew to hate it and myself. i found this subreddit completely by accident at 4am one year ago today and it honestly changed my life. i will never forgot what one person wrote wanting to be high when im sober but be sober when im high that just stuck right in my brain. i was so numb and disconnected from my thoughts i could not even articulate that feeling. before then i could barely manage a day or so without but being present in this community sharing my story supporting and being supported by others is what made all the difference. i could not have done it without you. thank you to everyone here and to rleaves. this community is a beautiful place the kindness and support is incredible. we all deserve so much more than being numb yet anxious lathargic and content with being senselessly bored. we deserve better and it starts with reclaiming your mind again. happy sunday everyone have a beautiful day leavers,sadness
the boredom i smoked weed full time for 6 years. after finally gettin clean at the end of last year i stupidly fell back into the routine during lockdown here in ireland. thankfully im clean again about 3 weeks now. the hardest part for me wasis dealing with the boredom a feeling i hadnt felt for 6 years. i think randy marsh said it best the truth is marijuana probably is not gonna make you kill people and it most likely is not gonna fund terrorism but… well son pot makes you feel fine with being bored. and its when youre bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. if you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you are not good at anything. anyone else relate edit this blew up more than i expected. to anyone else reading this ill offer you some advice i already put in one of the comments below that served me well. if you want to outwit the devil it is extremely important that you do not give him advanced notice. even if you only announce to yourself your intentions the devil will know because who do you think the devil is meaning try not to focus on giving up the smoke but rather on your actions in the present moment. if you tell yourself youre not smoking again for a year then your mind will present you with the idea of 365 excruciating days without smoke. get through today first it will get easier day by day.,joy
smoking every night to smoking every weekend for a month to realising nope do not want this in my life anymore benefits i have noticed thus far coffee is now rocket fuel and im down from 6 8 cups daily to about 3 night is now when i have the most adventures up mountains and in castles and beneath lakes and with the most weird of characters my erections are quicker and firmer but i no longer feel the need to appease the fella sudden surplus of cash essentially a 3k pay rise renewed confidence in myself and less social anxiety now that i do not have the secret shame of addiction actually able to remember shit from the films and documentaries i enjoy no longer wasting my evenings aching for bedtime to arrive to smoke my one a day my desire to interact with others feels at a normal level rather than overwhelming reluctance my sentences are more coherent and mental arithmetic is once again a pleasurable breeze,sadness

my secret 🔑 to finally just stop the cycle of self imposing slavery to the weed trap. 27 years smoking flew by. now im free and not falling back in hi everyone so 27 years living in a weed trap and could not figure away out of it. living the same loop knowing this problem with mj is a chain for life and the only way is to break a link. we all know we have to change our mindset to make a solid change. the mind is a deep mysterious place and we can truly change it if we want to know how. so when we just keep toking and dont actually stop even though we say or plan to soooooo many times. this is the conscious mind at work. so heres the 🔑 cbt cognitive behavioral therapy. and i dont mean going to therapy. i am speaking of a specific type of cbt. visualization i will break it down a bit. it takes very little time to do and is one of the most powerful cbt techniques there is. so what i did and it made a core change within me. here is what to do makes some notes on exactly the person you want to become how you will look feel be do etc. create the image of the best version of yourself that you want to become. then everyday as often as you would like. get in a quite place alone so you can focus. and literally think see feel and be in that person you created in your mind using all of your senses and emotions. do this process multiple times a day for 5 15 minute intervals. stay consistent. you will be 🤯. what should happen is in roughly 3 weeks give or take pending your consistency you will just wake up one day and have this urgency to be in that person youve been visualizing. neurologically whats happening is your going into the back door of your subconsciousnon conscious mind and rewriting your self image so to speak. it for me was like magic. i started this process about a month ago and no kidding around it just hit me in a way that the conscious mind can hardly believe. it flipped the switch i could not seem to do for myself consciously. today makes 2 days sober. keep in mind other factors can keep this from working like lack of belief it works not being consistent distractions while visualizing by others or you straying off of conscious thought. no promises it will work but it had a miraculous affect for me. your self image is the foundation for a solid person. eliminate all excessive intrusive intrinsic thoughts that are negative and keeping you thinking you are crap. they only reinforce disempowering thinking and keep you stuck in the old you. i hope this serves someone somewhere. it is the key for the trap door. but you will need to grow and or do more to keep from falling back in. believe in yourself and you can do anything you put your mind to. much love to all of you struggling to find your true self jb,joy
ca not f do it seriously want to blow my f head off. quitting due to being drug tested in a cps case. ive been slacking the past week or two and decided 2 days ago fuck this. this is not worth it. id rather have my child and be a productive father than sit around with a foggy head all day. its day 2 and i ca not even function properly. im constantly screaming absolutely fucking enraged at the wind blowing the wrong way i ca not play video games with my friends which is literally one of the only things i genuinely enjoyed. im not relapsing or planning on smoking but holy shit. how long is this going to last i thought about slitting my wrists open and i actually felt sharp pains in my arm for an hour after thinking about it for .5 seconds. i know it gets better but fuck. right now i just want to curl up with a 12 gauge and not wake up tomorrow. i hate my fucking job i ca not see my fucking kid my life is in fucking shambles and the one escape i had from this shit is gone for good. the world being in the state its in right now does not help either. i ca not go five fucking feet without absolutely snapping at something so small it does not even matter. not seeking advice judgement or anything along those lines. im just irritated as fuck and need to vent. thank you to anyone who reads hopefully the post does not get removed as somehow all of my posts on this subreddit do.,anger

weed became the source of my unhappiness and at the same time it became the only thing to give me relief from the very unhappiness it was causing. ive had enough of this cycle. ive smoked fairly heavily for 17 years. when i first got to college i was a completely different person. i was full of life i had a personality i could make people laugh i had wit and it was easy. i had friends women were romantically interested in me i waswell normal. i always struggled a bit with social anxiety but when i wasnt abusing weed i could swallow those feelings and put on my extrovert mask and go to parties and still enjoy myself in social settings. i started smoking in high school but i only really reached abuse levels in college. it was all downhill from there. i nearly failed out of college and became gradually more withdrawn as my abusive habit grew. this led to my social anxiety inevitably taking a stronger hold over me. weed only exacerbated that issue. ive been lonely for a long time. i had a friend here and there but mostly i have just felt empty and lonely. i gained weight stopped exercising and taking care of myself and this affected my confidence which only made the social anxiety worse. by the end of college i barely could recognize myself when i looked in the mirror. when i wasnt high i hated myself. i hated the person i let myself become. and i could never find any other form of relief for this pain the pain of self hatred. the only relief was weed which of course was the cause of all my issues. even though i have smoked for 17 years ive always been aware deep down of that fact and how dangerous it was. weed helped me forget the reality of all the career opportunities id lost of how uncomfortable i felt in my own skin of how alien i felt in social situations of the damage id done to my mental and physical health. enough is enough. i will try to face my self hatred and change whatever i have to change for these feelings to stop. i want a social life again. i want to be physically fit again. i want my personality back. hey mary jane seriously fuck you you were an abusive lover to me in every possible sense. and i am leaving you. this is day 4 sober. im never going back to you. never.,sadness
went on a surf trip with strangers. lots of weed going on. i felt no urge whatsoever. i found that i love to be sober no social awkwardness and paranoia feels good. im sober for 21 months. recently i went on a one day surf trip with strangers something new and challenging for me i used to have social difficulties. while on the road people lit one joint inside the van i said no thanks. at the beach lots of joints here and there. on the way back more weed. it made me remember that i was just like that having to smoke all the time. i felt good and free to be able to be just normal talk to people or just be quiet with no disconfort or awkwardness just chill. i honestly felt no urge to smoke or any frustration whatsoever. people were kind of friendly and did not care about me smoking or not and i did not care about them smoking too. i enjoyed the trip vey much had a great day talked to people got some pretty nice waves and went back home tired and happy it felt just great. i honestly love to be sober and free i hope you find that joy in sobriety too.,joy
sober me wants to get high. high me wants to be sober. i have been stuck in this loop for the past few years. i hate the dirty paranoid feeling and anxiety that i get after the first few puffs however i ca not seem to stop. i am a lot less depressed and anxious when sober. its logical to quit. why do i keep getting high its not doing me any favors. its rarely fun anymore. the only thing i miss when sober is the anticipation of rolling a blunt and the experience of passing it around the rush of buying and the first inhalation. everything after is misery. i do not know what to do.,sadness

being stuck in a cycle of smoking weed is like being stuck in a hole it seems very hard to climb out but once you do you realise the hole was not actually that deep. thats how i feel every time i gear up to quit anyway. i have severe anxietyfear leading up to my last smoke but once i get the first day under belt its like okay its not that bad.,sadness

id rather be sober and depressed than stoned and numb really tempted to relapse right now and this is what im trying to tell myself. im really tired because quitting makes it hard to sleep and it makes it hard to eat enough which doesnt help my energy levels either. i know if i relapse ill just have to go through the withdrawals all over again so im trying to tough it out. anyone else feeling this right now,sadness

weed is so dangerous because you stop realising what its doing to you while you do not even know why you smoke in the first place. while on weed i will never be confident not only around stoner friends work where i want and most importantly meet the woman of my dreams. ask yourself if you really want to live your next 5 years like your last 5. or if you wanna look back and be able to say yea what ive done the last years actually was not a complete mess like before all of us needs to accept one thing there is a little guy living in all of us who just wants to chill in bed smoke and do nothing. the purpose of our life is to fight this guy no matter what. he is not in charge you are. and if youre not show this little fucker how youre going to take back control over your life.,joy
i really miss being witty back in the day i could respond to somebody with a sharp witty comeback or statement when the opportunity presented itself. nowadays it takes longer for words to even register in my mind and my mind often draws a blank when attempting to conjure up a response. i miss having that quick thinking man. i need it back,anger
a suggestion from my therapist for me the hardest part of quitting was just knowing that i could not smoke. when i told my therapist that she told me something that really changed my perspective on quitting. technically speaking i could smoke if i wanted to im just choosing not to. now when i start to crave it i tell myself that i could smoke but i am not going to. its a really simple change of mindset that is super empowering. rather than feeling horrible about not being able to get high i feel proud of myself for choosing not to even when things get tough. i hope this can help some of you on here im so proud of wherever you are on your quitting journey and you should be proud of yourself too,sadness
i did one of my favorite hobbies yesterday without weed. i love kayak fishing the saltwater flats. watching the sun come up feeling the salt air looking for fish. i used to enjoy this every time for 12 years while high. its a massive trigger for me to go fishing and not smoke. i quit once for 45 days and didnt go fishing during that time. im on day 5 again and the weather was perfect. i started thinking about fishing and of course the triggers came. i said to myself weed you will not hold me back from something i love. i have been fishing since i can remember why should this hold me back well i went yesterday and had a blast. it kinda sucked on the drive there but as soon as i started paddling i totally forgot about wanting to get high. i was actually much more aware of what was going on more energy and no stopping for munchies. it was great. triggers are hard to get over but if you can go do what you want and make new memories. memories that you will actually remember,joy

tomorrows going to be my first birthday in 11 years without weed im turning 27 tomorrow and ill be 4 months and 15 days sober. it feels surreal cause usually wake up every birthday and smoke the whole day away but instead ill be heading down to a barn for a few days with my girlfriend. just wanted to say thank you to this community for helping me get through the last few months and give a reminder to everybody just starting their journey that it does get better. its totally worth sticking out the hard days cause weed wont solve any of our problems only delay acting on them. been living by a quote i saw on here my first few days of getting sober weed wont kill you but itll kill who you could be,surprise
for those of you who cant imagine not smoking i get it. i was a major stoner. i smoked all day everyday. like an eighth a day. if i had weed it was being smoked. before work during work after work. i didnt do anything if i couldnt smoke too. i spent 10 years like that. i tried countless times to quit. i would be able to stop for maybe a week but drinking everyday but then id return to it and id be back to where i started. and then one day i was just too sick and tired of being sick and tired. i couldnt handle it anymore. so i got help. i knew i couldnt do it alone so i entered outpatient treatment. ive now been sober from weed and alcohol for 59 days trust me when i say that if i can do it you can do it. you may need help and thats totally ok. but life on the other side is sooo worth it. if anyone needs anyone to talk to feel free to message me,joy
youre not an idiot youre just high all the time. this is my first post and hopefully a wake up call to myself that this lifestyle is starting to ware on me and its showing. my biggest fear in life is that i wont be competent enough to preform my responsibilities in life. the idea that you can do everything you can do sober just as well high is a lie. its been degrading my work for too long and its time to stop. when youre high or have recently been high your ability to search for answers and make decisions is fucked. you will not give a clear of an answer to a question. you will not make as good of a decision as if you were sober. you make life decisions and investments that are clouded every time you act under intoxication instead of clarity. if you werent high youd think clearer make more rational decisions speak clearer to people so that they would know how intelligent you actually are. instead youve decided that intelligence is inherent and doesnt need to be nurtured. rather than building upon ideas by reading relevant literature building relationships with people of similar interests or exploring your amazing personality. you instead hide yourself in an emotionless state spending your time energy and motivation to avoid the emotional roller coaster that is sobriety. show people that there is more too you than a silent figure who passes in and out of interactions. stop being excited to go home to a bag of funk. stop running away from being in a state of mind that people will learn to love you for. there is no originality in smoking cannabis only repetition. dont be the same thing you were yesterday its getting boring.,anger
hey newbies this is very doable. i smoked 43 years i started gummies 6 7 months before i quit and they were way more addictive than pot. it was hard like it was never hard before to stop. so it took a lot of energy to stop. many false starts. tossed a lot of pot paraphernalia and gummies. sometimes buy and trash twice a day. in the end writing all my feelings before during and after smoking or eating a gummy was the ticket. the details. when i read it back it is just pitiful being controlled by an expensive plant. i want you to know i only had cravings for 2 days and zero physical withdrawal. no problems sleeping. the first two nights i was up a little later than usual but no biggie. there are so many horror stories here from the long term use of carts gummies and whatever else that is super strong and not just your basic high thc pot. so today is day 20 and i am feeling fantastic you can do it too. edit wow this resonated with people. glad to help. today makes 3 weeks and that is how much time it takes to break a bad habit. never give up its worth it.,sadness
today i learned that its okay to crave weed i used to be high everyday all day for almost a year now. right now im on day 10. ive realised i have a lot of guilt when it comes to smoking weed. i thought that quitting should mean that i wont ever smoke again and i wont even want to. i have felt so guilty the last few days every time i wanted a joint in my hand. today ive realised its okay to want to smoke. its okay to crave something youve become so used to having and then suddenly disappears from your life. thats normal. people crave or miss weed drugs coffee junk food parties a holiday a special someone a pet anything. just because you want it doesnt mean thats wrong or that it is still controlling you. cravings are okay to have. there is no reason to feel guilty. its how you act in response to them that matters. edit thanks for all the lovely comments guys i wasnt expecting this to resonate with so many people stay safe and stay strong,sadness
does anyone else only feel motivated to stop smoking weed when theyre high usually the first thing i feel when i take a toke is guilt. guilt for having given in to the temptations of her sweet aroma. guilty for not being able to resist smoking even for a day. i do not smoke much per day usually 2 4 tokes but its still enough that i feel like i should not be smoking every day. ive been smoking weed daily for almost a year now ever since my girlfriend and i got an apartment together. i do not know how to stop or even if i truly want to. i do know however that if my girlfriend ever becomes pregnant i am taking all of our weed stuff and either giving it away or throwing it away. i just hope that when that time comes i will have the willpower to follow through with it.,joy
the smokers dilemma when getting sober sober me wants to get high. high me wants to be sober. it makes me feel like a yo yo. when i am sober i justify why smoking weed is okay. when i am high i make all my plans on how i am quitting weed. it goes on like this for sometimes months. it makes me insane. i want off this crazy train.,joy
i used to smoke before bed now i read ok i know its not the same thing but instead of thinking all day that i ca not wait wait to go to bed to get high now im excited to see what will happen in the next chapter. and weed made me lose so much time because sometimes i could not wait until night and i would lose the whole afternoon as well but reading its already fullfiling even if i have just 10 min before bed. i wake up much easier now and after 1 month i do not miss it anymore.,joy

all i want to do is inhale some jazz cabbage and watch the brave little toaster im 28 its been 5 almost 6 weeks since the last time i smoked after smoking nearly every day for the better part of 9 years. i stopped because it was not helping me making me anxious making me ruminate making my physical activities not as fun making me feel like i needed it to do anything at all among other things. since i havent been smoking i do feel more alive more connected to my life and my surroundings which is nice. of course theres also a lot of me saying hey demons its your boy jibsauce but that is to be expected. im proud of myself for not indulging myself thus far and i guess i just wanted to voice my desire to watch the brave little toaster baked out of my gourd even though i know it will probably not be as cool as i think its gonna be. gonna go on a walkmeditatejournaladventure now. thanks for reading and im proud of you for your journey wherever you are on it.,joy
yo. just wanted to say its been real. thank you for all your stories. i wont be here anymore. i went from smoking every single day to no smoking at all. i was smoking before work during work after work and until i passed tf out. this went on for two years. before that cycle i was an everyday smoker for 4 years in college. so thats just a bit of a background. today is the end of 65 days. this has been a really special week for me because i started running 3 miles everyday. i can already see an improvement. this has also been a special week because ive come to the realization that although ive been quitting a bunch of shit thats not good for me over the past few years such as caffeine alcohol porn ive failed to quit a subtle addiction that was holding me back. this is the internet. i never realized until recently how addicted i was. i wouldnt really spend any time on youtube or social media accounts but i would spend time here on reddit interacting with people i dont even know. and its alright at first. especially if the interaction is for your own personal development. i realized that soon i became dependent on certain type of posts that would give me a quick bit of dopamine. the search for good content is similar to the search for a good porn video. its crazy. idk if im just super aware of it now that im clean but i feel the release of dopamine whenever i see a good or funny post. today i was at lunch and i noticed everyone was on there phone scrolling through instagram feeds but they were still trying to have a convo. as in theyre giving their brains little bits of dopamine to feel good while having that conversation. ive also realized that whenever i would get home from work id go straight to my room and read a bunch of posts and talk to people around the world and completely ignore the people who are actually in my life and who actually matter like my family. but it all seems good right youre working on yourself and its okay to be all caught up in your phone because its for your own good. no. there is something seriously wrong and twisted with how consumed we are by our devices and how much we neglect real life interactions for a quick bit of dopamine from a stupid post. im typing this to you because i feel like even though we quit weed were still releasing dopamine through other outlets even the most subtle ones. people who were born when the internet came out and were unlucky not only battled a porn addiction but an addiction to wanting quick information. weve all been fucked up. im typing this now because i want to wish you all good luck in your journey. i wont be on here anymore for a really long time. im done with these distractions in life. thats all quick dopamine fix is just distractions. you all saved my life. i love you all.,joy
married professional momand daily smoker x 14 years. my dirty little secretday 8 long sorry. this is my story that i am posting for me reallybut i needed to share so thanks for this safe space. i started a new account as my other username is identifiable so excuse my lack of karmaage. i started smoking my sophomore year in college as part of a work hard play hard mentality. i was in a tough major and would smoke after a long day of class and studying. i had goals firmly in mind and smoking never got in the way. then at 22 i met my now husband a daily user who was a totally functional stonerand soon i was smoking during the day too but still only if i had nothing else going on class etc. thus continued our relationship with each other and weedthrough grad school me and entrepreneurship him. fast forward 14 years and we have 2 happy healthy young kids very successful careers a nice house in the suburbs etc. the picture of a perfect life despite continued daily use for us both. he still smokes more than i do as he can work stoned and i definitely cannot but i would smoke after i got home from work and again before bed. im not much of a drinker so i considered smoking weed my equivalent of a glass of wine since that is so much more culturally acceptable. i did not advertise my use to anyone. a few of our close friends knew i smoked occasionally but none knew how much i really used. i have felt guilty about smoking so much weed since having our first kid and especially as she has gotten older and takes notice when we disappear into the garage for a few minutes. that being said weed became legal in our state so it was easy to get we had money for it and was not affecting our careersso why stop well 8 days ago we went on a family vacation to a state where we could not legally obtain any ganga and on day 3 i had severe anxiety. i have a history of depressionanxiety but suspected it was withdrawalsand when i realized my headaches and night sweats were likely symptoms too i felt embarrassed. embarrassed that a grown ass woman a mom a professional was withdrawing from a drug she was addicted to. i made the decision then and there to quit completely. my husband was reasonably stunned and worried that i would make him quit too which i have no intention of doing this is for me and me alone. plus i could stand to go without the nightly stoner carb binges so last night was our first normal night at home after vacay and after we put the kids to bed my first real craving hit we always smoke together after they go to bed. instead my husband went out to the garage alone and afterwards we settled in together to watch our shows and snuggle and it was actually really enjoyable. i only ate 2 oreos as a bedtime snack a feat of control not possible while high and here i am on day 8feeling happier less ashamed more clear headed and with more desire to socialize than i have felt in years. and 3lbs down i know this is the right path for me and i am so thankful to this community as it has already given me so much strength and motivation. i ca not tell really anyone in my life of my success because they never knew of my addiction so thanks for listening friends.,sadness

being sober offers a high of its own im only a week and a half in so feel free to take what i say with a grain of salt. today i felt something real something palpable that i havent felt in years. it was like my body and mind were operating at peak efficiency and in perfect sync with one another. woke up early my sleep schedule is already 10x better than it was before i quit. sleep from 12 9 or so instead of 4 1 but thats beside the point ate breakfast and ran a few miles. thats when i noticed how unbelievable i felt both physically and mentally. it was a feeling that had never been accomplished through chasing fleeting body highs. i felt for the first time in a long time that i was on the right track in life offering a sense of accomplishment and a complete lack of guilt over my life choices past and present. it embodied a feeling of almost child like wonder an overwhelming rush that made me just want to dance and celebrate not giving a fuck about who was looking at me randomly exploding during a mid day run. at first i didnt even know what to do with myself because i had no idea what was happening. but im here for all of it. i think this is the way ladies and gents,joy

the lies we tell ourselves regarding moderation as a long time lurker ive felt such comfort in this sub when reading posts that relay the same feelings ive always held about my weed use and desire to quit. as such i wanted to share some thoughts i had regarding moderation and how ive always tried to quit with strings attached. im 27 now but i first began smoking heavily around 21 while in college. throughout college and grad school i was better than my other friends at putting the weed away before finals and that gave me a false sense of control over weed and my desire to always be high. in my mid 20s i began to notice the negative effects around smoking that we all know ex. lack of motivation complacency lethargy etc. but my life was on track and on paper everything looked perfect so i kept telling myself moderation was all i needed to achieve. i think ive considered and tried every level of moderation that exists but each comes with its own awful effects ill only smoke on weekends which makes that feeling of living for the weekend so much worse and makes the weekend fly by too fast while the week drags on. ill only smoke on weekdays the idea being that weekdays already suck so might as well smoke to ease the stress of work but all this does is make you dread every second of the workday even more so you can finally log off and having your weekend feel duller as you do not have weed to enjoy it ill only smoke at night makes you sleep in and ruins your mornings and you do not want to get out of bed as every second of the day that goes by gets you closer to nighttime where you can finally smoke and relax ill only smoke when my friends offer it to me this makes you seek out your friends for the goal of getting high or asking your friend for a nug to take home as you had such a fun time smoking with them ill only smoke on 420 or my birthday or on vacation or the special days that you can smoke began to add up and you realize you always have weed leftover so might as well smoke it all until its done ill quit for a weekmonthfew months this is my most common method. i gear up for one last big smoke sesh and then proudly tell others im taking a break. see i have it under control i can quit for a weekmonth so its clearly not an issue. but the deadline always makes you just count down the days until you can go back to being happy. every positive that comes with not smoking gets hampered by the fact that you know youre just waiting around to get back to it. how can you admit that you feel so much better healthier cleaner energetic etc. when you also know you are going to reintroduce weed back into your life what ends up happening is you dive right back in sometimes even deeper and the cycle begins anew. even now telling myself that i need to quit forever is tough. like so many of you weed has opened my mind and given me so many positive experiences. but i know that my relationship with weed is now a toxic one that only keeps me emotionally and physically stunted as the years march on. and i know now that my dreams of smoking in moderation are just ways to make sure i never truly have to grow and deal with the underlying issues of my addiction. weed is nefarious in that others do not clearly see the issues of your use but it slowly chips away at your spirit. your eyes lose a light that you know was once there. typing this out has helped me understand that what i really need is to quit wholeheartedly. im so thankful that this sub exists and i hope this post can help someone as so many posts have helped me. edit with all this said i do believe moderation has helped me throughout my life and im certain others are able to moderate their use and find a healthy middle ground in their relationship with weed. i just know personally that i use moderation as a crutch and have slowly come to the realization that i must give up weed for a long period of time before i even consider reintroducing it into my life.,sadness
weed makes you forget how to take care of your brain for context im taking a human development course that includes watching old informational videos about how to help infants develop cognition and language skills. whenever the narrator in these videos talks about how to foster growth and well being i realize how much my habit messes with this stuff. variation of stimuli many of us are content to watch and do the exact same things over and over when we are high. regular daily schedule sometimes i would stay up until four in the morning while smoking sometimes i would go to bed at five oclock because i was exhausted from being up all night. reciprocal interaction nah id rather be alone and think the same things i always have. i do not know if weed made me any dumber but i sure as hell know it was not making me smarter. ive thought these kinds of things before but something about watching babies say their first words after months of producing incoherent babblespeak woke me up.,joy
underrated benefit brushing teeth whenever i would smoke i would always just pass out and never consider brushing my teeth before bed. now i feel gross going to bed without brushing my teeth.,anger
hi my name is ray and im an addict hi everyone ive wanted to post this for awhile. i want to do 3 things with this post demystify the presumptions of marijuana addiction tell my story about being in recovery and allow anyone who has questions about sobriety to reach out. i just past 1 year of sobriety after 8 years of daily smoking from the age of 18 to 26. i lived a life of being a complete slave to marijuana. i needed it to eat. i needed it to sleep. i needed it to hang out with friends. i needed it like my body needs water. i did not really know anything else. this just seemed normal. then one day my girlfriend of 5 years gave me an ultimatum. either quit smoking weed or shes leaving. this hit me hard. i did not want to lose pot. pot was my medicine but i also did not want to lose the love of my life. i knew pot was a problem but society told me it was not addictive. so what the hell do i do it took some time but i finally mustered up the courage to call a local therapist. fucking expensive but it was something i had to do. i went and hated it. i hated admitting i had a problem i hated pretending like i wanted to quit. in reality i wanted her to wave a magic wand to take away my addiction so i could just smoke weed on weekends or something. this is not how recovery works. i kept going back because i had to. until one day she handed me a booklet called core beliefs. this is what changed everything for me i learned addiction is not actually the problem its the solution. the actual problem are my negative core beliefs about myself and character defects that cause me to be an addict. this hit me hard. for me my defects of character are low self esteem. i built an ego to protect myself from dealing with my insecurities a common defect. i was a chronic perfectionist nothing was ever good enough. another sign of insecurity. i grew up with big dreams and aspirations but never lived up to them. this taught me it was these very character defects that caused me to never succeed or even try and in order to deal with that stresspressure i would use. my addiction was the solution. a terrible solution. it still took me a few weeks to finally say goodbye because i knew i had to say goodbye forever. once i finally quit for a day i attended my first marijuana anonymous meeting. i really hated it. to have to sit in a room and admit my problem fuck that. i collected my welcome chip anyway and the second the meeting ended i tried to get out. but a gentleman by the name of amin stopped me and asked how i was doing. i told him the truth that i did not want to do this but i had to that i was scared. he said you know ray of all the 12 steps only the first step actually talks about marijuana this helped. it made me realize even more that recovery was about working on myself and not on my addiction. still my addict brain was strong. i went back to my therapist and told her i hated ma and thought it was stupid. she said youre right ray. it is stupid. and it works so i kept coming back. i went through the physical bullshit no eating no sleeping irritability night sweats. skip to the bottom of this post for tricks to get through this. i heard stories of people who actually told me sobriety was better than using. at the time i thought they were full of shit but i had to trust them i had to to keep that motivation. after a couple weeks i started slowly feeling a bit better. i started coming around to the meetings and actually begun to share . sometimes. lol. as time went on i kept doing the work. i went through the steps with my therapist. a painful experience. but i worked the program. in took about a month to start noticing changes in my behaviour. i kept going back to meetings. i started actually enjoying the meetings. being around a bunch of people going through the same bullshit as me with a drug that society laughs at you for having an addiction with it was the only place i could be completely honest. fast forward 12 months. here i am. 1 year sober and i notice my character defects going away. im not worried what people think of me i do what i want and say what i want without that voice telling me whatever bullshit. ive started building my dream this past week. a blog about my passions. something i would never do as an insecure addict. i can live a life of total freedom now. i can totally and honestly say sobriety is way fucking better than using. if you only take away one thing from this post make it this recovery gives you everything weed promised. i now go to multiple meetings a week. because i want to. i host an ma meeting at a rehab centre as well. helping inpatient addicts weekly. holy fucking rewarding that is. to tell you what ive lost since the day i quit weed i lost my job i lost my condo my favourite location of all time i lost my girlfriend after 5 months of sobriety we actually decided to mutually end the 5 year relationship i lost my business i had started my dog died and i can 100 honestly say i would trade all of those losts ten fold for the emotional wellbeing i get to experience today. im doing things here at 27 i never thought id be able to do. living in peace with myself. enjoying life. i still have a lot to work on. but holy shit the amount of change in myself ive done in a year i never thought i could get here and yet only a year later and im doing things i never thought i could do. somebody passed me a joint at a party couple weekends ago and it made me laugh why the fuck would i smoke this the emotional rewards are worth way more than this joint. and yet one year ago i was smoking 3.5 grams of this shit a day. this freedom its worth it. im no longer a slave to marijuana. but most importantly im no longer a slave to my brain. thank you for letting me be of service. please if you have any questions about recoverysobrietyma please ask me anything. im an open book. bonus marijuana anonymous highly recommend a recovery program. a sober addict without a program is a disaster waiting to happen if theres no ma in your town go to narcotics anonymous na or aa meetings . pretty much the same structure. you can also download the free ma app with all readings step work etc. available on app store. cold turkey or weaning theres no such thing for an addict as weaning off weed. youre an addict. weaning off is not fixing anything. when i first quit weed i had to quit every mind altering substance alcohol. because i lost these dopamine rushes i had the most sex ive ever had in my life i ate fast food daily cookies candy because im an addict and i need that rush. in order to truly fix the addiction cold turkey is the only solution. how to deal with physical symptoms for me they lasted about 2 weeks sleep wooooorkouttttt. sweat it out like crazy. this will also help with food. also go to the pharmacy and purchase melatonin. its the natural chemical in your brain that tells your body to go to sleep. it stops working when you smoke so much dope. food smoothies. i could not get anything down was never hungry. make smoothies because not eating is very unhealthy night sweats extra sheets. necessary evil for me the more sweats the better the dreams in a couple weeks cravings every time you resist a craving the cravings power lessons. irritability move your body. and do not trust any emotion for the first few weeks. your body is trying to fight you to get its fix heshe is not happy. how to actually quit. give yourself enough of a reason a purpose for quitting. i experienced enough pain from my character defects controlling me that motivation to fix them is very strong. write this motivation down. your brain is going to try and trick you into using. ive met people that went homeless psychotic handcuffed to hospital beds living off park benches all from weed. this is not the same drug as your parents smoked. the addiction components of this drug are seriously real. do not let anyone tell you otherwise,joy
just wanted to shout out how incredible this whole sub is. i just messed up my day 1 after only an hour of waking up but coming back here and checking this sub reminds me there is still hope. i will get there things are just hard i have been lurking this sub for a long time on and off over the years. weed has been steady in my life since i was 15 and i am now 26. i have been a daily smoker for at least the past few years now time is so blurred together it is hard to keep track. in the past year i made the realization marijuana is holding me back but every time i try to quit i end up reverting back to it. the past few months have been hell for me for a lot of reasons but the past couple of weeks i went off of my antidepressants cold turkey and have been in severe physical and mental withdrawal. i used weed to help cope as usual and it honestly made me feel worse more nauseous more angry. and i decided once i got my meds back again which i did last night that i would stop smoking weed for good or at least for a while. i decided i need to stop neglecting my medication and mental health for a life of getting high to numb the pain even though it has comforted me so much it has taken over my life and kept me stuck for too long. so this morning back on my meds and motivated and finally not feeling sick to my stomach i decided i was going to start today. its only 920 and i already fucked that up. i just was so bored and laying here not motivated and just could not stop thinking about how if i just take a hit it would help even it out. so i packed a bowl and did just that because for some reason my self control is that of a 5 year old. trying not to hate on myself right now so i went back to this sub to read everyones words of wisdom instead. reading all the posts on the front page of leaves instead of dwelling in my fuck up is making me feel better. i am still disappointed that i did this but i know it is not a linear battle and i have given up vices before weed just time and time again has proven to be the hardest one for me to let go of. i tend to give up and beat myself up when i make mistakes like this and then throw the whole thing away altogether but no. i am not going to let this one hit ruin what could be a good rest of day 1. i am determined and i have seen how strong all of you are and how far all of you have come if all of these people can do it who says i ca not too the support and positive vibes around here is incredible. i want to be free of this addiction so i can feel that too. sorry for the rant but i guess what i am trying to say thanks all of you for reminding me that i got this and allowing me to not let one impulsive bong hit turn into a full day of binge smoking. now i am putting the bong away and going to do a barre workout so i can get some natural endorphins and restart my day off right hope you all have a fantastic day,sadness
8 months i barely recognize myself from before. i smoked daily for over 10 years. when i quit i was depressed unmotivated isolated and hated myself. today i feel so much better. i have the motivation to improve myself in so many other ways and putting in effort for a better future. i no longer hate myself i actually kind of like myself and i think that has made it easier for other people to like me too. it was hard in the beginning but i am so glad i stuck with it. i feel like a new person and i was desperate to be where i am now. if you are struggling please hang in there. it gets easier and its so worth it.,joy
pot is addictive i was one of those stoners who believed that you could not get addicted to pot. its non addictive wrong. my brain makes up reasons to smoke addiction. i do not feel like i can get anything done until i smoke addiction. you ca not overdose wrong. i overdose every day it just does not kill me. my body does not feel as many physical effects from it now because i smoke so much overdose. but it does kill my motivation and my drive to be a better person. i live the same exact day every day because of pot. yes it may not be as bad as harder drugs or alcohol but i am not living a good life this way. it is covering up everything i need to deal with mentally and emotionally and is the reason i have not progressed as far in life as i had wanted. ive tried to quit in the past but never under the guise of an addict. i realized that if i swapped a bowl with a shot i would be hammered by noon. if this is not addiction then i do not know what is. my therapist recommended i try aa meetings or something similar. i just get so annoyed now when i hear people say that it is not addictive. i used to be one of those people but i think that was what helped me think it was okay to smoke every day. thats what makes it so dangerous. thank you for whoever listens to this rant. i just am having difficulty getting to the next step of actually quitting.,anger
19 years old my story and how my best friend‘s weed habit ultimately resulted in schizophrenia. please read. i am two weeks sober. im relatively young dude 19 years old compared to many on here. i was dependent on weed for two years. i tried to quit the herb many times but i truly believe this time is different. let me tell you my story. my post history on reddit is a firsthand example of the mental toll this drug has taken on me over the last two years. i went from a motivated high achieving student religiously posting on college subreddits to a complete stoner and anxious wreck warning those on roilpen about fake carts. like many of you i told myself the lie i was capable of being a high functioning stoner. in reality i became a barely functioning addict. coming out of high school i was accepted to a top twenty university on a full scholarship. i decided to take it easy senior year which is when i let myself go became a complete weed fiend. i absolutely loved weed at first somehow way more than most. i told myself i would quit when i went to to college. i distinctly remember meeting my roommate now one of my best friends freshman year of college. lets call him p. when i first met him i remember trying to feel p out contemplating whether or not i should tell him about my habit. both of us quite shy i decided to ask him if he had smoked weed in high school. he responded with a resounding yes and that he had been fiending since senior year as well. ten minutes later we both whipped out our dab pens the rest was history. we smoked every single day to the point where it became a ritual. we figured that we were young that we should live it up our freshman year. i was soon fully dependent marijuana specifically wax and was getting high all day everyday. this went on for nearly 2 years. fast forward to first semester sophomore year last semester p and i were still toking it up like crazy with only vague intentions to stop. all of the sudden at the beginning of last semester p became quiet sleepy and more unmotivated than usual. something was off and i assumed it was depression at first. i made the huge mistake of continuing to enable p by smoking in our dorm room and he never truly ended up quitting despite his intentions. this last semester not a whole lot changed regarding our pot use. we kept smoking and smoking but this time we managed to taper down stick to just flower. p however was still acting off when he wasnt high and i decided to finally confront him about it. he revealed to me that had been hearing voices for the past year. these voices were preventing from concentrating in school confining him to his bed all day. upon hearing this i broke down. it all made sense. when we were high so many times had p told me superstitious shit how he was communicating with god. i would just tell him that he was high as fuck and just trippin wed just laugh it off. little did i know that p was literally hearing a discourse between god and the devil in his mind. when he broke the news that he was hearing voices these voices were perpetually throwing him into a debilitated state i realized he likely had schizophrenia. upon this realization i tearfully asked p what if you hadnt smoked weed to begin with you think things would be different he revealed to me that ever since he smoked marijuana in high school something was off in his mind and he couldnt quite point his finger on it. as he continued to smoke like crazy alongside me his condition worsened to what it is today. im not suggesting that marijuana is the culprit for psychosis schizophrenia. i do know though that it can bring out these conditions in those that are at risk of developing them like p was even though he had no idea. i was affected by the plant differently. persistent hourly exposure to very high thc levels led to severe anxiety to the point where it was debilitating triggering multiple mental breakdowns throughout freshman year. i somehow continued to smoke to quell this anxiety which became a vicious cycle and exacerbated it in the long run. no matter how much i wanted to smoke in moderation i just couldnt do it because i was fully addicted. p and i are still very close friends have gone back home because of this corona shit. p who stills hears voices everyday has been sober for over a month. ive been sober for two weeks. we are supporting each other in this journey and i aspire to one day attend medical school specialize in psychiatry so i can help p and those suffering from similar conditions. as an addict myself i have taken an interest in studying addictions and also intend to go into addiction psychiatry. these past two weeks i have gotten intense cravings thought of kickin it and smoking a joint is so enticing. however i have taken comfort in knowing that my anxiety has vanished. the mental clarity is phenomenal. i have aced all of my exams this past week something ive never done during my time in college. i feel so much more confident in my abilities. i also have an extremely supportive girlfriend who i love deeply that tells me everyday i made the correct decision. whenever i get the urge to smoke i just think about all the negative shit this plant has caused all of us. it has blunted us made us perpetually lazy and has sapped us of our intrinsic human motivation to better ourselves. it ultimately destroyed my best friend. im never going back and this post can hold me accountable. edit let me make something clear guys. i am not staying weed was the cause of ps schizophrenia. according to the scientific literature the cause is likely attributed to an underlying genetic abnormality andor environmental factors such as exposure to teratogens. all im saying is that marijuana certainly exacerbated his condition and served as a pivotal trigger. upon smoking for the first time p reported he had never felt the same and that something was off even if had not developed the condition right off the bat. it may have been entirely possible he would have developed the condition anyway if he had not smoked weed but my gut tells me otherwise. edit thanks for the silver gold. heres to a life of purpose confidence and never giving in,fear
inspired by 150 days clean post i checked my sobriety counter 273 days clean. heres my story of how my extreme abuse of dabs actually almost killed me. its a very long and complicated story but i was addicted to weed. i smoked 30 dabs a day from my dab pen live in a state where its plentiful and cheap. it triggered something called marijuana induced hyperemesis that caused me to throw up uncontrollably for so long o had to go to the emergency room 6 times in two years for fluids and weapons grade anti nausea medicine. this in addition to 5 hot yoga classes a week weakened my heart and i didnt know it. vomiting and dabs can have a negative effect on your heart and so i went in for a short surgical procedure to have a lip cyst removed and the anesthesia stressed my heart to the point that it malformed called broken heart dz and triggered a domino effect of organ failure. i was in a coma for ten days and the shock caused my right leg to die from lack of blood supply. i was on dialysis a heart and kidney transplant list on a heartlung bypass machine called an ecmo that oxygenated and warmed my blood for me. i didnt end up needing a transplant but i did become an amputee at 23. i did suffer actual withdrawals from dabs in that i couldnt keep any food down the entire month i was in the hospital and i lost a lot of weight. im 25 now i recorded a podcast episode for this is actually happening episode 135 with the full story if anyone is interested. but when i tell my story now i get hate by people telling me im lying and shit. its not that weed in itself is harmful but im an addict and i can abuse anything to the point of harming myself. and i did. after i stopped smoking i became an alcoholic for a short period of time before i finally hit rock bottom and gave up booze too. so here i am 273 days sober. i miss it sometimes but i remind myself that i am incapable of using it responsibly and so ive lost the privilege. if you have any questions about my sobriety or the amputation feel free to ask.,joy
the real challenge begins when the high of sobriety wears off and you settle down into the realities of your life. stay strong lean on whomever you have to and take it one day at a time. 25 days sober the longest ive gone in 15 years. everything past 22 days is new ground untouched territory. im feeling good about it all but im also feeling what i put in the title like the endorphin rush from the initial sobriety has worn off and now all that is left is just life itself for better or for worse. this feeling is hard to describe i dont think its a negative thing but maybe not exactly positive either. can anyone relate,joy
i did not quit to feel better i quit so i can feel the pain of my lifestyle. i just realized this. weed enabled me to live a shitty unfulfilled life and not give a shit. so quitting is not going to miracuously make my life better. its going to make me actually feel shitty about habits like isolating passively distracting myself and not making any decisions to change. this is why its been so hard for me to quit. ive been smoking for 15 years. im aproaching 60 days clean and this is when i usual give up because i do not feel any better or i feel worse then i did smoking 2g a day. this time im going to accept that i feel lousy and use it as a catalyst to slowly change my lifestyle. i do not know exactly what i want my life to look like but im gonna start by slowly making the changes that i see a lot of you fellow leavers are making. im not gonna get caught up in the woe is me i do not feel any better so i might as well smoke mindset this time around. acceptance work and patience will be my mantra,sadness
sober for 1 year as of today i love being off of weed my memory and overall being has improved so much im never turning back you can do it too i smoked daily for 15 years very heavy user,joy
my list of unexpected less often mentioned benefits update og post below its been 23 hours since this post and im so glad that it resonated with many of you. while replying to your messages and comments i realized that i wanted to share my side because i feel like this addiction and sub needs the focus on positivity to keep going. dont count days focus on what you lose but what you gain. i shared my post with my not smoker bf. he admitted that its been depressing seeing me stoned dumbed down and pointless. im a different person since stopping and its been a realization for me to admit that its not just myself that notices the changes. keep adding to the list keep embracing your journey and keep supporting quiet lurkers thank you so so much for all of you you are all amazing ps and thank you for the awards its really the cherry on top ————— original post————— dear leavers im a loooong time lurker. been clean for about 8 months now but i have not been counting the days cant really even remember my last joint. kicked the habit after 7 years of daily use. the last months of smoking were just full of self loathing smoking miserably while reading your posts and deciding every time that ill quit after this one. after long build up i succeeded. since then i tried not giving too much importance to smoking in my head and been appreciating all the little things that i can doenjoy now in my every days. hopefully it inspires some of you just like you motivated me. i tried collecting some things that i dont see that often in this sub i think you are all so great with expressing the main learnings ups and downs of what we are going through. so here it goes being able to answer calls receive guests visit friendsneighbors with last minute notice. no need to plan my social life around being high. open my doors with pride. i used to be paranoid about the smell for anyone coming to visit or stay over guests finding my stash accidentally. especially paranoid with family the thought of my mom finding my stash gave me panic attacks. get lost in the house holding chores and other activities that i used to always get high before. id smoke before folding laundry or doing a batch of dishes if even doing it just to break the monotony. now i listen to podcasts audiobooks zone out and im happy about it. spontaneously get on my bike go for a walk leave the house to enjoy the weather or something im listening to and do it any time— not dreading leaving the house not planning days around when ill be a couch potato. planning and making healthy meals weekly mealplans i didnt have the energy and couldnt keep coherent enough thoughts focus and memory to plan. planning anything in general. trips next projects calendar home improvements having focusmemory combo back is priceless brushing teeth caring for personal hygiene even enjoying it starting and finishing projects hobbies around the house i learned to sew plant veggies upholster all things ive been putting out while high no ashes no stashes no stench no fear of neighbors police enjoying one on one conversations getting deep in somebodys story friend or stranger im not scared of people anymore and gained my interest back in others not caring what people think weed used to make me paranoid just walking down the street. i used to think everybody is staring at me judging and i had a sad narration of what they must be thinking about me. not thinking of myself as an addict or as a functioning person with a secret hobby im more forward with who i am open up to people more easily proud of what i achieved as a person for what i do not despite what i do thank you for everything for this community im going back to lurking.,joy
i found half a joint in the ashtray in my car and i held it for a minute and smelled it and then tore it open and scattered the cannabis in my yard so i could not smoke it.,anger
full two months of sobriety.,joy
one year clean 365 days i did it i fucking did it never thought it was possible. thank you all at this subreddit. if anybody wonders how life improved since i quit and wants inspiration. 1 promotion to a better job 2 lost 30 pounds 3 learning to drive 4 reading regularly 5 mental health significantly better 6 sleep better 7 physical health much better if anybody has any questions im happy to answer. keep up the fight everybody still going. edit thank you for your kind words everybody i will try to reply to every comment.,joy
365 days clean i did it i made it one whole year without consuming cannabis. ive set a new years resolution every year for the past few years writing in a journal every night no meat no soda and this year no weed. because ive successfully done other resolutions i knew i could do it. but this one was harder than the others for sure especially because i didnt consume meat or soda every day and the journaling was a new habit. after about two months i began to dream again remember them the next morning at least. also began feeling emotions again– no more being a zombie dragging his feet along in life. ive felt happiness again as opposed to just joy from having some laughs kickin back and smoking a joint with the homies ive saved quite a bit of money no exact dollar amount but i know there is an app out there that i definitely plan on downloading this next year that tells you how much money youve saved from not buying bags every week. if youre interested in giving it a try i say start tonight at the start of the new year. take it one month at a time dont set out thinking im gonna go a full year without this just think im gonna go a full month without this if you think itll help reward yourself at the end of each month buy yourself something nice with the money you wouldve spent on bags but instead you saved congrats. or if you really must smoke a bowl or if you‘s rather plan 3 or 6 months in advance with a bigger reward a trip somewhere a new computer a new upgrade for your carhouse etc. ive been living a happier life without weed. for a while i considered smoking on january 1st at least to see if id still like it but ive lost interest in smoking. i can still appreciate the plant however. when friends smoke i no longer have the urge to join them but instead admire and appreciate it without partaking. please feel free to pm me if you ever need some kind of encouragement or whatever,joy
finally after 17 years of smoking almost daily i achieved what i thought was impossible. this is the longest ive ever gone without and i wo not be slowing my momentum toward a better life ive now gone without weed for 22 days my previous best being 21 days with dozens of attempts lasting only a day or two. i still have an active mmj prescription and all my paraphernalia and regardless of that i still quit this time for good. these past three weeks have been some of the best of my life. i broke up with my lying cheating girlfriend quit alcohol weed soda and caffeine started writing a book organized my life and possessions started exercising daily quit playing video games and now only watch tv while eating read a few hours a day started meditating and putting a lot more effort into my hobbies the list goes on and on. what started all of this was the added clarity and motivation in finally giving up weed and in large part thats due to the community here so i really just wanted to say thanks. thank you to everyone who posts here and shares their stories and successes no matter how big or small. i thought id never be able to enjoy the things in my life without being high all the time and that could not be farther from the truth. my life has become so much better without it. its cliche as all hell but i truly believe that if i can do it you can too. best of luck to everyone on their journey and have a safe weekend.,joy
day 2. wow who would of thought former plug and a person who smoked 3 to 5 blunts per day for the past 6 years would finally quit. i know its going to be a long journey. i couldnt sleep last night no appetite no motivation but im pushing through. you all have been a great inspiration.,joy

day 3000 a life changing decision this month marks my 3000th day in a row as a non smoker. 8 years ago i had smoked cannabis for more than 10 years just about every single day from my teens to my twenties. im now in my thirties. back then i had some breaks lasting weeks now and then but never managed to kick the habit completely. in fact towards the later years of my smoking career i was in a cycle of quitting and relapsing. i had a lot of first days of quitting. like hundreds. i had many times where i would get through the hardest early weeks of restlesness sweaty nights mood swings and general discomfort and then relapse when i started to return to a normal state. returning to baseline somehow seemed to lower my guard and i began forget why i wanted to quit in the first place and would talk myself into smoking again. the last time i smoked i had been on a vacation in a foreign country where i was abstinent for 3 weeks. i came home and relapsed the first weekend while drunk i felt like shit and decided to quit again. this time i joined a gym monday and started working out seriously. i had always kept in decent shape but now i finally decided to make it a central focus of my life. with that decision i had found what needed to replace my weed addiction. i was a compulsive smoker now i could use the same habit driven determination to become a better athlete. once i got going it felt so nice and once i started noticing improvements in my life i then knew that returning to the old ways of smoking ment i would lose it all. and that deterred me from relapsing. but i had to get the ball rolling. my many past experiences of relapsing also helped me predict vulnerable situations i could then prevent by making the right decision preemptively instead of being impulsive and relapsing. finding new dimensions of my identity was the hardest. i had to figure out who i was as an adult without weed a companion that had followed me through my developing years into adulthood. weed is like your best friend you always know where you have. it was linked to almost all aspects of my life who i was where i went and what i did. letting go of that relationship and moving forward into new territory feels uncomfortable. but in order to grow as a person old ways sometimes need to die. speaking of friends almost all my friends smoked. since most were good friends and still are today i needed to become a no man when it came to getting high together. saying no thanks is hard but really powerful. this also inspired some friends to quit themselves. some still smoke today on their 15 20th year but some have quit. guess who have matured the most looking back now man have i grown. since kicking the habit i now have a college degree a loving family and i am in the best shape of my life physically and mentally. the memory and foggy mind cleared up. the depression and anhedonia have improved considerably. the anxiety is gone. i sleep well. of course i still have ups and downs like everyone else but everything became much easier. im positive i would not have the same quality of life today if i had kept on smoking. the addiction is like malware in your operating system. it creates pop up spam with cravings and smoking ideas. the pop ups are sometimes random but are usually triggered by stimuli that are associated with the feeling of getting high such as after eating before sleeping being with friends watching a movie etc. even negative emotions works as triggers if you are used to smoking when you feel sad. the good news is that as time without smoking passes the pop ups fade. in the beginning i would think about smoking many times a day even many times an hour. then it was a few times a week. then a few times a month. now the thought may cross my mind rarely but its more of a nostalgic memory than a real desire to smoke. so if you are struggling with repeated thoughts about smoking give your mind time to let go of the old habits and remember that you are not your thoughts. this post is becoming long but i wanted to tell my story and i hope it will inspire you to quit for good. cannabis wont kill you but it will prevent you from reaching your potential. i do not know about you but i want to make the most of my life. i know that wont happen if i sit on my couch being high dreaming about what i could have done. some tips 1 find a hobby you can invest your time and energy into that brings you growth and happiness learn to play the piano. learn a martial art. paint. run. read books. lift weights. go fishing. pick up something that you used to do but forgot about or try something new. join a community where insert hobby is the focus. do whatever you like just do something else than smoke it will help filling the void. if you pick a social hobby thats a great way to meet people that you can hang around with where smoking is not the focus. 2 exercise. it improves sleep depression and helps you feel better. it gives you goals you can focus on with your newfound spare time. tip 1 and 2 can be combined. thats what i did. 3 involve your close ones in your decision. they can help you when you are feeling down. they can better cope with your mood swings if they know the reason behind. you will feel responsible for sticking with the decision to not let them down. 4 if you relapse take it as a learning experience and do not be too hard on yourself. yes you will feel guilt but try to make the most of it. figure out what went wrong. was it the physical discomfort was it social pressure was it restlessness and boredom was it because of a bad day how did you feel who were you with use the insights to make smarter decisions going forward. feel free to ask me questions. tldr i quit after more than a decade of daily cannabis smoking. my life quality has since improved a lot. you can do it too.,sadness
free of weed for 50 days when i first started i did not know how long i was stopping for. i just knew i had to quit. i was sick of my head being cloudy feeling like i was getting stupider every day and doing the same thing day in and day out. i smoked every day for 10 years after 530 pm earlier on weekends. i did it mostly alone because i hated stoners who made weed their whole lifethinking i was different because i just smoked in the evenings and was highly functional in life. but i realized that i was a stoner and it had become my life. i got anxious being away from my house where the weed was. i got anxious thinking about moving or traveling to somewhere i could not freely and easily consume cannabis. i got anxious thinking about drug tests. i got anxious thinking about having to drive anytime after 500 pm. i planned everything around cannabis. i was 100 addicted. i still am. i know i will never have a healthy relationship with cannabis and because of that it cannot be part of my life. im so glad i quit. if its day 1 or day 0 for you just listen to yourself. if a voice keeps telling you to quit listen to it take it day by day. eventually 1 day will become a week a week will become a month and a month will become 50 days stoked for 60 days 90 days 6 monthsand many many more milestones after that thanks for all the support weed free fam bam,sadness
fuck weed i am on day 6 after more than 15 years of regular use and several years of heavy daily use. i have tried and failed to quit dozens of times. weed has nearly destroyed my marriage damaged my relationship with my children and hampered my career for too long. fuck weed. i am no longer giving it power over me. i wo not let my brain tell me its fine to smoke just once a week when i know damn well that it leads back to constant use in just a few weeks every time. i am 38 years old and im so much better than the stoner that ive become. im over it. disenchanted. its not cool. if you are 15 or 20 or even 30 years old and you smoke more than youd like stop now. do not cut back. do not take a break. stop. if you did not have a problem you probably would not be on this sub and if you think you might have a problem you probably do. every day you allow smoking to become more ingrained into your routine is a day youre getting closer to becoming a life long stoner who is unable to put anything including yourself before getting high. some people can do it every once and a while and its fine. some people can even do it once a day or 3 times a week and they never feel the need to increase their use. good for them but were not them. stop pretending its fine because its not. the sooner we can realize that its causing nothing but pain the sooner we can say fuck weed and work towards being ourselves again. thanks for listening.,joy
a huge shoutout to all dads out there quitting. i cant even imagine trying to tackle this while taking care of my kids. yall some real ones,joy
funny how time changes you i remember during university where smoking weed was this cool lifestyle choice and meant having fun with friends having some laughs exploring a new subculture. then university ends but the party can keep going right weed was just an unfairly stereotyped drug with no downsides if only more people smoked the world would be a better place. then the chilling with friends and smoking became smoking a bowl alone and watching some tv or playing video games. still a great time though right this was the life then slowly your hobbies start dropping away and you find yourself dealing with anxiety when hanging out with friends sober or high. then you miss a few important events because you were getting high and its not a big deal anyway right people need to chill out. then the years and the smoking keep going and you realise that maybe the weed use is not all good. maybe the reason you were using it so heavily was not because it was so much fun but because there are some realities you do not want to confront. maybe the world is not quite how you imagined it to be or you are not the person you thought you were. then every bowl every spliff every vape is just another way of hiding from your own life. hiding from your ambitions and the chance you might fail hiding from rejection that would prove you were not good enough as you always thought. 2 weeks today and no intention of smoking for the rest of 2019. its time to go outside and face the world.,joy

do not replace the addiction with sobrietyreplace the addiction with an adventure so big you have to be sober the addiction is a substitute for that adventure. my vision is to be one of the most recognized and powerful figures in my field and that means that i ca not be high in order to get there. whats your adventure,joy
this is the last thanksgiving im going to spend alone. i wo not blame all my pitfalls on weed but i will say a good 80 of them stems from it. today is the last day i feel sorry for myself and turn to weed as an outlet to escape my problems when life gets overwhelming. im tired of spending special occasionsbirthdaysholidays alone. ive built a plan and wo not look back. its time to focus on me for me. happy thanksgiving everyone im eternally grateful for this thread.,sadness
day 29 and ive been crying all day literally ugly sobbing. i guess everyone was right when they said suppressing your emotions for 20 years would come back and hit you like a freight train. i am fucking exhausted.,sadness
the worst thing about having a problem with weed is that literally noone understands it. ive been to two different therapists lately and have mentioned being a marijuana addict. one of them just looked at me blankly and one of them literally said something along the lines of well maybe you could just cut back. i have a friend for 15 years and he still does not get it. i guess this is how things used to be and still probably is to a degree for alcoholics. no one would believe them or tell them they need more willpower or whatever. i remember posting on imgur a long time ago that i was addicted to marijuana and i literally had fifteen responses that just said no youre not. its not even addicting dude blah blah blah. i went to na recently and feel out of place. never can figure out that chapelle bit boo this man anyway. im glad this place exists. because its an annoying problem. like im sure cocaine and heroin are worse addictions i get it. but if i said im a cocaine addict trying to stay clean that would be fine. people would get that. with weed its just like no one in the world understands it as a problem.,joy
sober for 9 months i cant describe the happiness im feeling i cant even get myself to remember those days of numbness and stupidity its way too painful to look back and get reminded of that misery. how could i just lock myself in a room and just be numb these 9 months have provided me so much insight for why i felt the way i felt and i came to the conclusion that weed is not a solution to my problems at all. im working to improve my physical and mental health everyday and i have never felt stronger even though i feel like shit at times. sobriety is the best. stay strong people and dont ever look back.,sadness
today ive reached 700 days sober. back with another accountability post to mark 23 months sober today i wish i had some insight to give you but to be completely honest i do not remember much about how to keep yourself busy and away from weed. just one more month until i reach my ultimate goal of 24 months but my heart goes out to the people who are struck by boredom because of this pandemic id imagine that this would be one of the hardest times to quit.,sadness
yesterday was so hard but you guys kept me strong. i decided to manage my thoughts and share them with you. i advice everyone to do this it helped me.,joy
why marijuana addiction is bad imagine you find yourself living in the jungle in a strange dome like environment like youre in the hunger games. you do not quite know where you are or what youre supposed to do but you are human so you know you must survive. in the distance a lion approaches. he growls and appears fierce and angry but he is small enough that you feel you may be able to defeat him. the lion begins sprinting towards you and you begin sprinting towards it. when you are just feet away from one another both of you in the air about to attack one another a mysterious harness yanks you from the scene of action and away from danger. youre flying in the clouds by a string. its nice and cool and you are at peace. there is no danger here. you have been saved. hours later you are released and find yourself on the ground. there is no lion any more and you are relieved that the mysterious powers have saved you from having to fight the lion. but a few days later the lion returns hungry as usual and you prepare for combat. you begin to run towards each other and right as you are about to collide with one another you are pulled up into the air once again away from danger. time and time again you are saved from having to fight the lion. over time the harness begins to pull you up even before you start sprinting towards the animal. you begin to run less your fight or flight instinct begins to activate less. due to lack of activity the muscles in your calves and thighs begin to shrink realizing they do not need to be so big anymore. for five years you are supported by this magical harness and are freed from the burden of ever having to fight the lion. but while you lingered in the clouds light headed and away from danger and physical work the lion has gotten bigger stronger and hungrier. one day the lion returns monstrous in size and hunger. he begins to run towards you but you do not flee nor do you panic. because the harness will save you. but on this day the harness does not come. and you realize you never learned how to fight the lion.,fear

i have not smoked weed this entire decade day 31 i am so proud of myself and so happy that i followed through on my decision to finally finally quit after 20 years tethered to this nasty soul killing habit. i have felt happier and more free these last 31 days than i have in years. even when i have a bad day and ive had several this month theres nothing thats worth jeopardizing how good i feel. thank you leavers for being here this community is amazing and i never would have made it through this first month without you lets keep going.,joy
i was always the stoner friend2 months sober whenever i went to parties i would have weed on me and would share it around. i had people message me and say i caught the smell of a joint today and it reminded me of you so i thought id check in since we have not spoken for a while. someone came up with video game character sprites for my old friend group and i was the one holding a joint. with those dumb facebook games of what would you include in a summoning circle to summon me it was always weed and rolling supplies. i had no personality beyond being high. im 2 months sober today and ive been trying to find my personality. i am a good cook a bookworm dog lover and nature enthusiast. i enjoy management games and circus skills contact staff poi and the likes i am in a dd campaign and am planning on going larping. before the pandemic started i started going to a weekly lgbt club and a juggling club. i was also working up the courage to go to a poetry open mic night. im learning french. i do not want to be the stoner anymore. i do not want people to expect me to turn up places and get high. i want to be more interesting than that. i want to reclaim the hobbies i lost due to lack of motivation and find more in the process.,sadness
smoked a joint on day 53 and i feel terrible made it more than 7 weeks without a puff. the clarity led me to realize i have to leave my partner now. ive been unhappy a long time and trying to cover my misery in a haze of marijuana. weve lived together several years and the splitting is a little complicated. im trying to get all my ducks in a row before i announce my decision and go might be another week or two. in the meantime the stress and anxiety is hard to bear while pretending everything is fine. so i thought 1 little joint yesterday afternoon would be okay to help me through. it did not help just amplified the anxiety. i still plan to go but am doubting other decisions ive already made about where when and how to go. i puked 3 times this morning. i feel so overwhelmed. i threw out the remaining joints i had been keeping in the fridge for some reason. wish me luck guys i need it.,sadness
im so proud of myself that i reached a 500 days milestone exactly on my 30th birthday i didnt plan this at all but apparently i smoked my last joint exactly 500 days before turning 30. double celebration time,joy
today i said no thank you to weed thats it thats the whole post. someone offered me a very nice looking blunt and my whole life raced through my head in about 6 seconds before i very nicely said no thank u i am trying to quit 😎,anger
smoked an ounce a week for the past 2 years straight. 2 weeks sober about 2 weeks out and holy shit. i used to use weed as a stress reliever and quickly became addicted because im constantly stressed. got to the point of smoking 10 joints per day an ounce per week. the irony is im realizing now weed was also making me insanely depressed anxious and paranoid this entire time. i thought those things were part of my identity and weed was helping me. its so fucked up the way it warps your perception of yourself and your life. 2 weeks out i am calm. i am not shaking and sweating and crippled with anxiety. the state of the world is incredibly stressful and yet i am coping better than i was when i was high. also started eating healthy and exercising ive probably lost 10 lbs in that time. i feel amazing. i convinced myself marijuana was the only thing keeping me sane. turns out it was the only thing actually making me feel crazy,joy
if it makes you happy it cant be that bad. if it makes you happy then why the hell are you so sad weed works. . .until it doesnt. we dont need it. . .until we do. . .and once we do. . .it sucks big time. clean day 26 after 26 years of smoking. im never going back to that life ever you can quit too if you really want to❤️👊💪,joy
i wish i knew how risky substance abuse was. i did not even see weed as a substance. it lowered my inhibitions and i really had no perception of the consequences of my actions. it really clouded my judgement. acting on impulses can lead to ill thought life choices and potentially dangerous decisions,anger
advice from recovered my future sister in law is a recovered opioid addict. she shared a sentiment that really stuck with me and food for thought for anyone thinking they can just have one joint. the first time you pick it back up its a choice. but after that the addiction is in control so many times have i gotten sober enough that my mind starts to clear and i think to myself that i can just smoke with friends or i will only do it once. its never just once and its always back to a daily habit after that. i feel like i owe it to myself to see where i can go when i dont have weed holding me back. so heres to the day we make the right choice and everyday after that. its never worth it even though it might feel good in the moment. love to all struggling.,joy

ever since i started smoking i stopped reading i started smoking regularly in 2018 which quickly turned into a near daily habit. it was so exciting at the time and every activity on weed felt so fun and novel. it felt like a miracle drug it eased my social anxiety and helped me be more relaxed and talkative. i was so happy to just get home from work in the evening put on a chill video game or movie and spark up. fast forward two years i feel this has had some really bad effects on my life. while i have not been a constant daily smoker its been enough to really shape my life in ways i do not like. one of the things i really miss is reading. before i started smoking i was an avid reader and would devour books about philosophy history and politics as well as plenty of fiction. while i still read some on my own time and still read for university the time i spend there has drastically gone down and i feel so much dumber for it. not only could i not read with all the time i was wasting just getting high and playing video games but i also feel like my memory went to shit and any reading i actually did i had god awful retention of anything that i learned. this is not to mention how lazy ive gotten with homework and studying. while i still have good grades ive just been doing the bare minimum and have lost the pleasure i had for my classes before. another area of my life that has been really affected by my smoking has been my social life. ive always struggled with maintaining an active social life as i have pretty bad social anxiety at times. while i mistakenly wanted to believe that weed was helping me in this respect it was really making things worse. weed made it so much easier for me to just bail on social events that i dreaded as well as stuff with friends so i could instead stay home light up and have a great time just chilling by myself. on top of this i think its helped make me a really boring person. especially for the first year of smoking i did not do anything really. just spent so much time on my own getting high that i did not really have anything to talk about to my friends. i think its also increased my social anxiety and made me more self conscious when im around other people. and now its gotten to the point where ill often start to just think about how much im fucking up whenever i smoke. its gotten really unpleasant. im in my final semester of my bachelors and i want to get my shit together. im applying for grad programs and i do not want to half ass that like ive been half assing my last two years of my current degree. i know im a really capable guy when i try and im tired of just checking out to chase a high that does not even feel good anymore. i want to really work on improving my social anxiety and getting back into the hobbies i left behind for smoking like reading and making music. none of these comments about weed are a condemnation of the plant. i had some really good times with it and want to maybe enjoy it in a more reserved and measured way later in my life. i think in a social setting its nice to hang with some friends and chill with a joint. but for now i think i need to take a year or so off and see how my life changes. i feel like im really out of touch with my sober self and want to work on life. tldr smoking daily has led me to stop reading and trying in life academically and professionally. also really negatively affected my social life and turned me into a hermit. i need some good distance and time from the drug for a while to get perspective and change some things in my life. thanks for reading if you stuck through. hope maybe someone can relate to this and that it perhaps helps strengthen their resolve to improve their life.,sadness
deadlifting is the greatest cure for marijuana addiction. it gives you a natural high to replace the hole left behind by weed and eases withdrawal symptoms significantly. if you are a chronic smoker struggling to quit weed i want you to try deadlifting or any other powerlifting movement of your choice. while powerlifting has many benefits i want you to ignore all of the ones you typically associate with weightlifting and use it solely as a tool for breaking marijuana addiction for three reasons. 1. deadlifting will give you a massive adrenalineendorphin high that will replace the marijuana high with one that makes you feel better and most importantly you still had to work for. this also has a large number of psychological effects that will help your brain heal from constant substance abuse. 2. deadlifting will increase your appetite massively and will make you have a good relationship with food. 3. most importantly deadlifting is an amazing sleeping aid. it is more effective for sleep than melatonin and even weed. you will sleep early and you will sleep sounder. good sleep is necessary in so many ways to combat weed addiction and weed withdrawals. finally i just want to say that i hope everyone that is struggling with marijuana can find a way to get sober. i am rooting for you all and i know how difficult it can be. please comment with any questions or concerns. edit if you are going to deadlift please do a good amount of research on how they are performed correctly and start slow. do not try to hit your personal best immediately. depending on your fitness level you may need to gain a certain level of flexibility in order to do them correctly. i do not think you should be performing deadlifts unless you can touch your toes. please be careful when doing any exercise and always be mindful of warming up and pushing yourself safely.,joy
i just threw out every weed product i own in the house lets do this it was weirdly emotional for me to really gather everything and collectively throw it all away but im super proud of myself for taking this huge step. i can do it we can do it,joy
do not put so much weight into a sover streak. obviously do not relapse but im tired of people shitting on themselves. im tired if the i was sober for 6 months then i took one hit and now im such a loser. so youre telling me its reasonable for you to have an expectation of perfection when dealing with addiction youre telling me you dont think of it as 179180 days clean how is that not a win when dealing with addiction. stop restarting the clock on yourselves when you falter once. sure if you start using again for a week then i can understand restarting the clock. but these i took one hit and threw x months down the drain is childish. youre better than that. edit watching the discussion and positive comments has been the highlight of my day. im glad we shared with each other. edit 2 my goodness these responses are absolutely amazing.,joy
hey yall ive been smoking weed on off since i was 19 im 22 rn i was off it for almost 6 months before i started smoking again in september. i hate my current state wish me luck today is my first day being sober again.,joy
7 years thc free just checking in today is my thc free anniversary and im trying to make it a personal tradition to revisit this subreddit each year and do a little update. when i was in early recovery it really helped me to hear from folks who had a bit more time so im just trying to pass that along. its also a chance for me to celebrate and recognize something that i honestly just do not think about in my daily life anymore you can see my previous posts for more detailed backstory 6 years 5 years 6 months ive done so much over the past 7 years that i could not have done if i was still high all the time or if i had killed myself. we are living through a time of such immense stress right now on a global level and i feel like i am returning more than ever to the skills i developed in early recovery. last year i posted a timeline so here just two significant things that have happened since then. 1. my spouse and i opened a small business 8 months ago. obviously this is a really challenging time to be a small business owner but we are getting through it one day at a time something i learned to do early in my recovery. 2. something i have not mentioned in past posts is my physical pain which has worsened a lot in the past year. i have had chronic migraine for a few years and this year i also got a fibromyalgia diagnosis because of my constant chronic body pain. it is challenging to engage with the online support communities for these conditions because a lot of people recommend medical marijuana which obviously is not an option for me. i also wonder if my drug use was somewhat keeping these symptoms at bay when i was still smoking. to anyone who is starting their recovery right now you are doing a great job i am proud of you to the mods it is so wonderful to come back to this sub and see how the community has grown yall are amazing. i do not know if ill have the energy to answer too many questions today but ill try to check this account over the coming week or so as i am able.,joy
one year sober today after years of heavy smoking on this day last year i had my last bowl and said goodbye to an addiction that had a strong grip on my life friendships finances and everything i thought i was. sobriety forced me to re evaluate how i dealt with my emotions daily routines and really actually learn who i am. i am healthier happier far more successful. i have hobbies and much more meaningful friendships than just seshing up together to smoke all of our money and for me it was the best decision ive ever made. the first year has been filled with some really fucking hard moments but a lot more satisfying ones and im so excited to hit every other year after this. i am fucking stoked much love to all here i cant wait to celebrate everyone elses sobriety goals with them. you all rock,joy
advice from a former stoner and reassurance that you too can quit just like me to start this post off i want to say that for 4 years i probably smoked on average 4 5 grams a day sometimes getting so stoned i kind of just witnessed the world go by each day like a television with a sitcom on in the background. i would stuff my face with large quantities of food after every session as it was my favorite thing to do and i will say the taste of food once the munchies hit might be the one thing i miss the most then once i got home porn and masturbation were a necessity and lastly video games until i fell asleep. does this sound similar to your every day or your life if it is youre living in absolute hell and youre not even living youre just existing. good news is that if youre on this sub youve already had the groundbreaking realization that getting high all the time might be harmful to you maybe not physically but it damn sure does keep you from living life. withdrawals are hell you probably wont be able to eat and you probably wont be able to sleep night terrors were a thing or me especially when dreams came back very vividly. the best advice i have for this is melatonin really helped me in terms of getting proper rest through the first week or so. what i can tell you for sure though is ive been marijuana free for a whole year now and yes the mental clarity comes back and yes enjoying the little things come back and yes life is absolutely beautiful and fun and god i laugh at things now i would have never taken notice of in my hazy days. ive formed many great relationships over the past year namely being my girlfriend of 7 months who i never ever would have had the courage to talk to without the mental clarity of being clean ive started college this summer and currently in pursuit of my bachelors degree along with transferring to a large university this coming spring. i feel smarter than ever the wit i had as a young high schooler is back and its sharp as a tack. meanwhile all my friends who are still getting stoned are doing the exact same thing and in the exact same place they were a year ago and many of them have excommunicated me or just simply dont talk to me anymore minus a few. this is okay with me because it wasnt by ill will on my part. the best possible piece of advice i can give and this covers almost any basis in this life youre given an amount of energy each day and what you spend it on each day is what your life will manifest itself into put it into relationships your job your education and maybe even pursuing a spiritual path. dont waste your energy put it into things that will grow and give back to you learn to love yourself and life again not a plant thats holding you back. i wish all of you the best of luck and i know its hard but its attainable and life on the other side is wonderful,joy
i am not bored because im not high im bored because boredom is a completely natural feeling. my off days seem to be the thing that gets me the most like today. currently bored out of my mind. but hey before i smoked weed every day i remember being bored sometimes too. people who dont smoke weed have times of boredom and they dont fulfill that boredom by altering their minds with drugs. they find meaningful things to do like going to the gym which i need to do today.,sadness
was sober 5 months last year relapsed for 4 when coronavirus hit back to sober 26 days now and feeling great to anyone else out there struggling you got this im happy to say that the times im using are getting shorter and shorter compared to the times im sober. i went 5 months from the end of september to february. id started to use only a few times and then coronavirus hit and it quickly spiraled into everyday. at first i was okay with it. i felt success in having figured out the root of why i am addicted to weed through counselling during my 5 months of sobriety. basically id figured out that due to the neglect i experienced as a child from having an alcoholic parent i grew up really fast in order to survive. i became a little adult child who did not know how to have fun anymore. when i actually grew up smoking weed was my way of allowing my inner child to come out and have fun. however as im sure most of you know smoking weed is not a sustainable approach to meeting needs. so my challenge has been to learn how to have fun in healthy ways. not a bad problem to have in the grand scheme of things so back to trying to get through this pandemic like everyone else and im back to smoking weed everyday again. i tell myself it helps me focus better on doing my work from home. its fine for awhile until august rolls around and i have a few traumatic things come up in my relationships. things really spiraled down then and i began smoking all the time just to feel alive. it sucked big time being in a haze where you do not even feel like its a choice anymore. bleh. its not even fun at that point just depressing. enough was enough after 4 months of being back at it it was time to quit again this time for good. so i did in early august and have been clean for 26 days. in the first week i felt really good. no problems then week two i was having issues sleeping and feeling stressed out. week 34 i started to feel physically depressed no energy and i just wanted to eat all the time. it started to turn into mental and emotional depression as well. i could not focus and felt like i was not getting anything done. my sense of self worth really started to drop. thankfully things have started to turn around week 5 and wow am i feeling so relieved ive gotten so much work done this week and can actually focus on what i want to do. i feel calm and centered with a relatively positive outlook on life. my lungs still feel a bit weird but im sure that will take time to get better. so really i just want to say to anyone whos reading youve got this sometimes it feels really hard and you might relapse or you might have intense cravings. but i promise you its worth it for the past two weeks i was really starting to question whether or not i would need weed for the rest of my life just to feel good. now i can say for sure that this is not true things will ebb and flow but i can promise that in the long run you will feel better not being addicted to weed. peace,joy
smoked again after a two month break and it was the best decision ever it made me realise why i quit in the first place. after two months of being alcohol weed sugar and caffeine free i decided to smoke a few puffs at my best friends birthday thinking im over the hump and wont want to go back to smoking on a regular basis anymore. this turned out to be true i have no intention of brining weed back into my life and heres why 1 smoking made me antisocial and ended up falling asleep on the sofa during the party 2 it made me slow and lazy again in the last few days 3 intense dreams and insomnia are back 4 my anxiety is back not as intense before but annoying enough. 5 my stomach is almost as upset as it was the first week into quitting after smoking every day 6 ive been working really hard on my mental health and now my feelings are a bit numb again to sum it up im almost back to where i started in terms of physical symptoms but i have no regrets. now i know that even a small slip can set you back massively and not worth throwing away all the hard work and progress for a little high and not being the only sober person in a social situation. if youre having a weak moment stay strong. or if you happen to slip just be forgiving with yourself and take it as a reminder of why you made the decision to quit originally and bounce back to your healthy life straight away. thanks for reading and good luck with your journey ❤️,sadness
personal bestthank you all for so much support,joy
31 days sober after smoking for 5 consecutive years lets continue doing this i am thinking though to smoke a joint when i reach 2 months sober15 07 20. i want to be able to like smoke once or twice per 12 months. but i am afraid that i will relapse and before i know it i will be smoking again every day what are your opinions on this should do it or not and has anyone stopped from daily chronic use but been able to smoke occasionally like once a month or even less frequently and if you managed how did you keep it under control because to be honest i do not want to never smoke again in my entire life. it is just way to nice.,joy
lets hit another one.,joy
officially 30 days today 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😭😭😭😭😭 holy crap i look back and cant believe this journey has been 30 days already. its funny how it seems like only 2 weeks ago that i quit but in reality it is now double that. i remember the night before i quit and the realization i had that it was all a facade. i remember feeling like life would be so boring without weed. and then realizing it seems boring because i never get around to doing what i plan because i get too caught up in wanting to feel high. being high is over rated and i now cringe at my pothead friends who react so negatively and aggressively when i mention how im glad i quit. fuck quitting is usually the casual response i get in return. i mean i get it ive been there too. i know ive said it to others before in the past and man do i feel foolish about that now. 30 days in wow. for those who dont know i pretty much quit cold turkey. i tried to do a fade out but it kept extending. so when i ran out on the morning of august 14th i told myself that was it. no more. my original plan was to quit after school ended on august 21st and it wasnt even a few mins later when my mind went why not quit later after all the pandemic is going on anyway and i wont get my degree in the mail for a few months so i cant apply anyway. im glad i didnt listen to that stoner mentality in my head. im glad i didnt listen because i ended up getting cleared for graduation earlier than expected and now my degree is in the mail and on its way im glad i didnt listen because i found out a job i wanted was hiring. it was my dream job. and i was offered the position. i am accepting it. im glad i didnt listen because i can only make so much off of unemployment. and i deserve more. im glad i didnt listen because now im 30 days sober and realize how fucking dumb weed is. for those of you who are on day 1 or are starting tomorrowyoull be glad you didnt listen either. it will be worth it. i promise. so much good will happen. the universe will bless you. it will thank you. you will become your biggest fan.,sadness

a healthy person changes their behavior to match their goals an addict changes their goals to match their behavior. dont get hung up on the word addict. call it dependent struggling constant user etc. the point is you know when pot is not serving your true purpose. you have to surrender to who you are. youre perfect with all your imperfections. love yourself. practice love practice what is good and above all be kind to yourself. you cant help others without helping yourself first. i love this community. ive been through hell in my 101 days sober still am struggling hard but i know that its worth it. if i go back and add to the 22 years of smoking ive already done ill return to spiritual suicide. yet some days i want to. its my shadow its my gollum its the venom suit its the void. is the pain worth it yes. i can tell myself no its not but the virtuous and purpose driven man inside knows it is. i will not trade my innate glory for a half baked life. thank you leaves community you all are worth it. good night.,joy
goodbye weed it was a good ride but im moving on with my life now. 😁 im usually just a lurker but i thought sharing my experience might help someone else so here i am. i smoked daily for the good part of two years and it was great i was able to unwind and relax at the end of the day and drift off to a peaceful sleep. the problems started when i had to stay home for the majority of the time due to covid student on summer break. during this time i was going to be staying with my parents who arent very drug friendly so i was planning on quitting but after a couple weeks of being sober i was looking for a fix again. i couldnt smoke anymore since i was now living with my conservative family and it would be too obvious. i was looking for ways i could get high and i saw that edibles would be a discreet way i could. one thing led to another and i was now hiding edibles in my room and starting my day off by getting high. so the days went by like this with me stoned in my room watching movies and playing video games and laying in bed all day. then things got even worse. i was a porn addict but i managed to get it under control by replacing it with a good habit of working out and even managed to start dating a bit which was the main part of my life that the porn addiction was affecting. flash forward back to the beginning of quarantine i was spending my days high as a kite and as many of you might have experienced it quickly gets boring and you have to do more and more to get that dopamine rush. this was the perfect storm for my porn addiction to come roaring back and now i was getting high and watching porn multiple times a day. the months went on like this in a blur and one day i saw the date and i couldnt believe that it had been almost 4 months. i was consuming an ungodly amount of edibles and spending hundreds of dollars a month. i barely spoke to any of my friends during this time and often ignored their attempts to reach out since i was too busy getting high. i realized that this had to stop and this wasnt the person i wanted to be and started searching for help online on how to get my life back on track. this subreddit was a great help i saw the stories of so many people who took back control of their lives from weed and decided that enough was enough. its now been 4 days that ive been sober and today i even went out and went for a jog around the neighborhood. my biggest challenge has been that i havent been able to fall asleep ive been sleeping 3 4 hours a day on average. if anyone has dealt with this please tell me what worked for you. im still going strong though and i know i can keep going with all the support this community provides. to anyone else dealing with similar problems i hope my story helps you on your journey of staying sober. im here along with the rest of this subreddit to support you. thank you rleaves for all your help.,joy
just hit 2 years. heres 4 things that got me here. i hit my two year weed free anniversary a few minutes ago. along the way i endured the death of my dad my dog my kid getting expelled another with serious depression a custody battle with my estranged wife being totally broke and friends telling me weed is not addictive and paws does not exist. i think most advice is useless but offer mine now as a way of showing gratitude to the universeas a matter of fact thats the first one 1 develop the habit and attitude of gratitude which lifts your mood offers inner prace and attracts all the positive things in life. 2 exercise every day you can. many of us are anxious to begin with and it can be difficult to meditate but you can sweat out much of the nervous energy that led you to weed. 3 be stubborn about avoiding weed. some days i ca not even remember why i quit but i just say no anyway. being stubborn is generally a negative behavior but when it comes to weed sometimes you do not need to think just refuse to turn back the clock and go back to day 1 of quitting because just one puff and you will remember why you quit. 4 rise above it. no matter what life throws at you you do not need to react or argue or get down into the negative weeds. stop fighting life you have only so much control give up accept and do what it takes to get past it and move on.,fear
sometimes things fucking suck. weed wo not help that. ive been smoking weed for about 10 years. im on week 2 and im done. ive decided it and im not going back on that decision. it used to be fun with me and my friends. now im an adult and find myself using it mostly for an escape from reality. i have not had a terrible life but ive had my fair share of battlesissues. still do. ive struggled with depression for a long time but i have not been honest with myself about it. recently an amazing relationship has come to an end due to my mental attitude with life that has spilled into my relationship. its completely crushing and is giving me every reason to go back to smoking. im not going to. unfortunately its just now that i can really admit to myself that weed was always making things so much worse. although im going through one of the worst times i have in so very long i wo not go back to smoking. im going to win this battle and make it. sometimes things fucking suck. weed is not going to help that.,sadness

anyone else having a hard time staying sober during this pandemic im trapped in my apartment for possibly months all alone with little to do. sure i can keep binging movies playing chess piano taking baths etc and that stuff is awesome but i keep considering that maybe this just wasnt the time to turn a sober leaf. anyone else finding it particularly challenging to stay sober while stuck in their apartment with nothing to do,joy
if you think weed helps you function keep this in mind just a reminder for those who are struggling to quitstay sober particularly those who think weed might be beneficial to their functioning. when weed is in your life you may notice better moods more motivation and overall better functioning than when you are sober. its important to remember however that this does not necessarily mean weed is helping you. you might just be dependent on it meaning you function worse without it which is objectively not helping you. functioning without any outside help is so freeing and is so much more real than with pot. give sobriety a try for a few months and when everything is sort of reset you might be surprised how low your quality of life was without even truly noticing.,joy
smoking weed to suppress your emotions is like paying for a credit card with a credit card. im realizing this now. by medicating emotions with weed youre only digging yourself deeper and youre going to have to do that much more work eventually to dig yourself out of the hole. i have found prayer and meditation to be helpful to me in moving myself in the right direction.,joy
one year sober today no joke. edit thanks for the gold and all the kind words,joy
6 months no cannabis i hit the six month mark a couple days ago. i feel great. ambition mental clarity returned. a different life really. glad to be here.,joy
weed ruined my dental hygiene habits as gross as it sounds one of the things that weed really screws up in my life is dental hygiene. i have one of those electric toothbrushes that syncs up with your phone recording how often you brushed your teeth and i just saw this correlation between me starting to go harder on the smoking and the decline in how often i brush my teeth. i did not realize this because you know how it is when weed starts taking over your life you decide to skip on certain things for a few days and before you know it it becomes a habit. im done with that. we are all lazy and weed is an enabler of that and im done arguing with people that keep lying to themselves about how weed is not affecting their lifestyle. its not that im going around people telling them to stop smoking but quite the opposite its people disagreeing with my choices because it makes them question their own. its interesting i do not know anyone that has abused substances as much as i have and yet i see things that they do not and never get defensive like that. stay strong and do not get discouraged by people that do not know what they are talking about,anger
556 days weed free after 20 years of daily smoking you can do it too a small motivational post thanks to this community i achieved this mark today on my birthday you can do it too,joy
one week sober and i wanted to celebrateby smoking ass backwards i know. i guess this is how the addict brain works. now that ive made it through the worst withdrawals and proved to myself i can be sober my dumbass started thinking maybe i could smoke since its the weekend. one hit couldnt hurt right wrong how long before the weekend turns into just at night and how long before just at night turns into all day given my history it probably wouldnt take long before i once again turned into an all day everyday self loathing stoner. fuck that im not going to fall for that shit. just had to get this internal struggle off my chest. felt like i had to write this out as a response to my addict brain that keeps trying to tempt me. if anyone else feels like telling my addict brain to fuck off please feel free to do so. couldnt have made it this far without this communitys support. love and strength to you all.,joy
i have about 100 quid left for the month i could spend 50 on cheap food and 50 on some more weed i chose to make a mealplan for the next 2 weeks and spend all of it on food and i am feeling awesome,joy
one week sober. holy shit today marks one week sober from weed. ive never been more proud of myself in my entire life. if you told me i was going to go sober 5 months ago i wouldve laughed in your face and now look where i am. i always had the mentality that weed controls my life and thats that. now i realize that it doesnt and i can be happy sober. im still struggling with my emotions sleep and nausea but im slowly doing better every day. im so fucking proud of myself.,joy
4 months completely sober today no weed no alcohol for 4 months today this by far the longest sober streak ive had since i was 12 years old and i am 54 now. thats kind of shocking to write down. my like is not paradise its largely the same. the difference is that i am present for everything and i have been brave enough to face all of my challenges without intoxicating myself to cope. i credit therapy a focus on radical acceptance and mindfulness. i am learning to accept and appreciate all experiences good and bad. its not easy but it has given me so much self esteem that ive lacked. i can do this and i do not need weed to feel good when im unhappy or to enhance experiences. i love the freedom of not needing to constantly think about my next high. other things i like no brain fog better memory and better energy i wake up easier in the morning i am more relaxed and less anxious and im more in touch with my true feelings now. before i did not know what i was feeling most of the time. i was so anxious until i got high again. then the anxiety cycle repeated time after time day after day. yuck. i like this new me so much better i think i am on my way to a better life. this sub has been a great help to me. i will keep coming back to remind me what early sobriety is like and try and help others however i can. for those thinking about giving up weed i can honestly say it is a great move and the short term withdrawal is very much worth it i also want to encourage those that try to stop and relapse its ok its taken me many many tries. do not get down on yourself its a process just keep trying. persistence is key this drug is stubborn edit changed the last couple sentences to be more encouraging 💪❤,joy
i have not smoked pot since may 20. my friend in high school told me that after 3 months your brain feels normal again. it stuck with me and ive been chasing that 3 month for years and im so happy to finally be there. he is right i felt that big difference at 3 months but i continue to feel better every week. edit april 20 not may. edit 2 happy if i could inspire some people. anyways im moving on frrom gaming and this social media thing. im moving on to other things. i will soon be a paramedic ill be helping broken souls or people fighting for their lives. i hope i do not see any of you soon.,joy
having a clearer mind has let me see the damage ive done this is not going to be the usual my life is so much better since i quit type of post but more a shit reality has smacked me in the chops what the fuck have i done type of post. i decided to quit just after the new year its been over 4 months now. my head is so much clearer i can focus better and my memory is getting better. but this has had a downside because now i see the damage ive caused to not just my own life but the others around me. im about to turn 41 ive alienated myself from all the people i once had in my life. ive lost my partner who was the best thing to have ever happened to me through inaction and being lazy inconsiderate and completely selfish. because of this i no longer get to live with my beautifully incredible son which hurts every day that i have to leave him behind to go home. ive closed doors in my life that im not even sure i can open again. over 20 years of this habit all ive done is create my own prison for myself all i wanted to do was get home from work get my son to bed and get high watching television. i neglected the most important people in my life time and time again through the money spent and time wasted i took their right to a happy fulfilled family and smoked it. at the same time i neglected my mental health i spent years with crippling depression and anxiety not even thinking that all i was doing by smoking was making it worse. i created masks for myself to hide my mental health i hid lifelong conditions that i did not realise i even had because being high all the time did a great job of keeping me from realising my issues. these masks i made for myself have been hard to take off but im glad that i have done. over 4 months in and im never going back im receiving therapy again to deal with the regret that ive left myself with the biggest being not doing this sooner when the people around me were ringing the alarm bells as loud as they could. if id paid attention to the people that loved me i would not have to go home at night and look at my walls with nothing but the deafening silence of all ive lost ringing in my head instead of the alarm bells from the people i love trying to warn me when i was not listening. despite the failures and the regrets that ive caused myself im sure that i will get things back on track again. i ca not quite just hit the reset button i have to deal with what ive created but i can try and start a new chapter for myself. thanks for listening.,sadness
i cry almost every day i smoked heavily from the age of 15. im now almost 28. 4 years ago i moved from my home country where grass is crappy expensive to a new one where grass is hq cheap and more recently legal. i moved here to be with the woman i love a woman who thanks to a weed related breakdown early in our relationship did not want me smoking. so i quit. and i quit again. and again. but every time i would take it back up because im weak. i would smoke behind her back very frequently. i would actually look forward to days that she would get home from work late or go out with her friends because it meant i got to smoke. she never found out but it ate away at me and our relationship. we broke up 3 months ago after almost 5 years together. it was amicable she said we both tried our best but it just did not work. but the truth is i did not try my best. i never tried my best for her. because weed was my focus against my own will and judgement and it tore me away from her made me love her less. and i can never tell her that. i can never tell her that our relationship could have been so much more if i had just been stronger for us. ive been off the stuff now for 8 days.this is at least my 15th serious attempt at quitting and im determined to make it stick this time. ive thrown so much of my life away because of my need to smoke and im sick of it. my thoughts are getting clearer im at the gym every day but its so damn hard. quitting tobacco on the same day probably was not the best idea but that was something i lied about as well and im dedicated to leaving the old me the disgusting liar me in the past. like the title says every day is a struggle. i ca not tell if the tears are because i miss her or just a withdrawal effect or both. the first few months since the break up were much easier and i really did not feel all that sad so im inclined to think its the latter. anyway sorry for the long post. i guess im just writing this all out for my own sake but also to thank everyone in this group from the bottom of my heart because whenever i feel like theres a pile of rocks on my chest and i start to consider driving to the dispensary on my way home from work i head to rleaves and find so much inspiration to keep me on the path. you guys are my heroes we can do this together.,sadness
its friday i ai not got sht to do or have to go to work tomorrow but i ai not getting high 3 months sober today suns shining had a good day seeing some friends tonight. life feels much better without weedhash. so glad i have made it this far looking forward to 6 months good luck to everyone else and thanks for the support,joy
weed will always be there but you need to heal first i am making this post because this mindset helps me tremendously. if youve quit for a day a week or a month it doesnt matter you didnt quit because you dislike weed i would imagine you quit because you lack self control. if youre a day or week or month or year in and say see i can quit just fine then youre still controlled by your desire for escapism. you still dont have control. if youre thinking about it daily you still dont have control. if youre thinking ive quit for long enough you still dont have control when you return to weed it needs to be like returning to green beans if you havent had them in a while. you dont count the days since you last had green beans you dont care if you dont finish your green beans and throw them away. you can have them right in front of you and be indifferent. once you are truly truly indifferent to smoking again then you can smoke freely. i have quit for months and not been over it then relapsed and was quickly addicted again because the addiction was still alive waiting to be fed again. only if your honest with yourself will you know that youre truly in a different place. i doubt i will be for years. i will not smoke with you today. i may tomorrow but just not today. i am still addicted. good thing tomorrow isnt real. weed isnt going anywhere and youre not going anywhere while your still in a hole. get out of the hole and you just may realize that weed was never the problem it was just the solution. fix the problem then you can truly enjoy weed again if you so choose at the time. peace. . . . edit finally at home and can edit this. first of all thanks for the nice response was not expecting that. second i want to address a point i heard in the comments that is worth serious consideration. instead of trying to rearticulate it heres the comment. even after decades and thinking your in the clear and becoming indifferent an addiction could sneak up on you if you go back to using the substance you were addicted to i guess thats where i disagree with what you said. upierrelacroixs it will always be there and maybe we can control it but maybe we should be thankful once we reach the green bean status opposed to testing our luck again.,joy
7 months soberand i found a weed pen in my jacket pocket hi everyone as i said im 7 months sober and my life has improved dramatically. ive truly never been this stable and content before. however recently i havent been so good about making my sobriety a top priority compared to when i first got sober. i havent been going to as many meetings etc. so yesterday i go to a meeting where i talk about how im getting sloppy with my sobriety and need to refocus myself. im walking out of the meeting to the subway and i feel this hard thing in my pocket. i havent worn this jacket since last winter. i pull it out and its a weed pen weed was my drug of choice. i was in shock. i havent touched a weed pen in 7 months. a devil voice in my head tells me to check and see if its charged. i press the button and it is. i had the thought like wow just take a puff take a hit. i immediately called a sober friend who told me to throw it out. i went to a trash can and held it over the trash. i literally couldnt let it go. finally i did. but then as i was walking into the subway station i had a wave of regret and thought you should go back to the trash and get it how disgusting. like first of all i wouldve looked crazy rummaging through a trash can and second of all thats gross. ive talked about it with many friends and theyre all proud of me for throwing it out. but it was scary that it was so hard to let go of. it reminds me that we are always so close to relapsing and sobriety is so fragile. i cannot believe i was able to throw it out without taking a hit. if i can do that anything is possible. love this sub. thanks for reading.,sadness
hard drugs destroy what you are. weed destroys what you can be. heroin and meth have effects that can be seen that can be measured physically over time. thats why theres such a strong stance against them with no support. weed however has no physical or obvious effects that can be detrimental overall. its the cognitive ability that is effected by weed. it destroys your habits your thought processes your judgement your potential. the argument that weed is the best alternative to hard drugs is correct but that does not mean that it is harmless. the least of all the evils is still evil. if you have the ability of moderation then by all means go for it. but some people a lot of people dont. whether they realize it or not. ive been battling in my head whether weed is really all that bad. the fact that i even need to debate it is the key thing that drove me to quitting. ive relapsed several times and each one ive literally gone out on my deck and paced pondering whether or not its such a horrible thing. when i quit i feel good make better decisions learn things easier cultivate my skills in my passions and hobbies create better habits my mood and overall well being is greatly improved. why do i keep debating on whether or not i should give that up for a few minutes of dopamine natural highs are way better and have a much greater payoff a good life. not a good feeling life. i can trust my judgement now and my life is 100x better without it. i also know that moderation is not an option for me. i can trust that too. fuck you weed. you robbed me of a year and a half of my life that couldve been spent building a better one. nows a good a time as any to start though. thanks for letting me ramble. have a good day everyone.,joy

day 25 and i think i had an epiphany about what weed did to my brain and body my body is surviving the trauma of weed the withdrawal symptoms are horrible for sure everything is hard it makes you just wanna relapse. but ive come to a realization. weed has deleted my bodys memories. anxiety my body used to get cannabis to calm it down and now my body forgot how to handle it. its a muscle that i have to train. depression my body was happy and now it forgot how to be happy and produce the happy chemicals. breathing my body forgot how to breathe and now it realized it was going through a trauma with a little physical activity everyday it will get better. social events my body forgot that hanging around smoking joints is not enough for a social life now it has to learn again to join the community. fulfillment one joint and im satisfied and that explains why i did not do anything with my life my body is now craving fulfillment. memory my bodys brain activities were damaged and it has to learn all over again to analyze and concentrate. appetite my bodys appetite used to be induced by cannabis and now it lost it it needs to learn to want things again. surviving the trauma of weed this means now its in physical and mental therapy we have to learn how to do everything all over again i know we all wanna feel normal but we cant we have to learn a lot of stuff all over again. our body needs physical therapy.,joy
instead of smoking i went on a hike with my dog.,anger
anyone else notice after they quit that they had numbed traumatic memories with weed quit smoking weed 9 days ago for the first time in 8 years. i went to a counsellor for the first time today and before bed i was thinking about one of the traumas that i spoke about with her that had happened before i started smoking weed. all of a sudden i can feel the emotions that i felt back then and i feel like ive pushed them away for 8 years with weed and its like i can feel them again. holy fuck it feels like i just put a blanket over the problem and numbed myself and made myself forget the pain all this time. its really hard to be feeling again. did this happen to anyone else i feel like i finally have to learn how to deal with it and learn how to cope with those memories without a crutch edit thanks for your responses everyone. one of the best things about this community is knowing that youre not alone in what youre dealing with second edit a song came on perfectly timed for me today and i wanted to share it with you all if you havent heard it inner ninja by classified,sadness

miss mary jane is the most seductive little trickster ive ever known. and i was madly in love with a pathologically lying narcissist once. but you you were something else. miss mary jane you are so goddamn good. until you arent. until you drive me to the point of near psychosis. until you make me panic so hard that im shaking uncontrollably. until you make me forget every little detail of my life. until im convinced youve damaged my mind maybe permanently. and i still cant get myself to even blame you. to be fair its not your fault. im the one thats always coming back for more. you were good to me once. you got me through so much. you held my hand. you were a friend when no one else was. you helped me process trauma. you inspired me to keep going. you made me laugh. you got me through the day. you were more than a friend. i was in love with you. but mary i need you to know that its over for good this time. im at my breaking point. i tried to make our relationship fair. i tried to see you only every once in a while but i always end up back where i started. obsessing over you while i destroy my life and my sanity. you and i were like two magnets. your pull is just too strong. and i always want to come back for more. so im cutting my losses throwing you and everything that comes with you out of my life. replacing you with healthy habits and self love. im sorry mary. i just cant be around you anymore. im choosing me this time for good.,joy
2 years without weed hey everyone just wanted to check in as it has officially been 2 years since i quit. my last time smoking was the last day of memorial day in 2018. i was at a bachelor party in las vegas and used that as my last time i would ever smoke weed and i am pleased to say i have not touched it since. from a daily heavy smoker to now free from weed tobacco vapes etc. if you told me 3 years ago that i would quit cold turkey and not even miss smoking weed i would tell you that you were crazy. but here i am 2 years later looking back and being so thankful that i made that decision. it was not easy. i quit many time before that and never was successful. but here i am 2 years without weed. it was probably the best single decision i have ever made in my life. if i can do it you guys can lets do it,joy
christmas day marked 30 days without weed something that seemed impossible once upon a time as a 25 year smoker. thank you all for helping me get here. oh and i got engaged. im loving these sober holidays keep flourishing yall,joy

please for the love of god help me. my name is a michael . ive been smoking for about 7 years regularly. in that time ive gotten married and had a family. ive got a wonderful life and an amazing job im 32. recently ive wanted to quit smoking for the sake of my wallet and my sanity. the problem is my guy never has a problem fronting on short notice and lets me wrack up like 800 dollars at a time that i slowly chip away at every pay day. my family never goes without just so i can pay that but it certainly keeps me financially stressed and im just tired of the cycle its exhausting . i need to stop ive got no assistance really in terms of an outlet for these almost shameful feelings of failure i get even openly admitting this problem. this seemed to be a safe place as cliche as that sounds. so. today is day one. i have to do this. please help me.,sadness
old woman breaks old habit day 10 ill be 60 on 4 20 and it gives me great pleasure to say i will not enter my golden years chained to addiction. seemed like such a huge change as i was an all day one hit wonder wondering why i kept at my one hitter all day for several years once weed got legal near me. i had too many scruples to buy from a dealer. but like alcohol just because it was legal did not make it right for me. clarity is returning. my sleep is fine and i am shedding that head down and try to hide it way of life. hello pride gratitude relief freedom. heres to the olds we can do it and we are. ☮️🧠☮️,joy
i like the idea of smoking weed more than i actually like smoking it. so day 3 has just ended and after having a pretty good day i fancied writing something up just to get it all out if nothing else. ive realised that the idea of smoking is far more appealing than the reality of it. i can picture it in my head right now. smoke a few bowls play some video games fuck around on the internet maybe watch a film. sounds like a good time and in all honesty it should be right but i am an addict. i ca not control my weed smoking at all. i get up mid day have a shower eat something then blaze up. i find that i ca not stop clock watching. how is it only 3pm i feel so tired and lethargicam i even high or is this just a headache i could really go for a nap right now. why not an hour or two later of drifting in and out of sleep leaves me in a zombie like state. wait did i even sleep or was i just sitting with my eyes closed in a stoned daze again i find myself clock watching. i smoke in periods mid day then the evening then at night before bed. so im clock watching waiting for the next period of the day to start so i can fill my bong full of ice and blaze a few bowls. see i would not need to do this if i was rich and had a huge pile of weed but im not. i find myself tactically smoking to try and stretch every last gram. ive come to the realisation that this is not fun. i came to that conclusion years ago yet here i am still smoking at least a gram a day. its just too fucking easy to let yourself continue doing it even if you hate it. because at the end of the day it numbs you to that hate. you stick to the idea of smoking weed and how great it seems in your head. yeah ca not wait to smoke this fat bowl even though deep down i know in a couple hours ill be sat feeling shit wondering what the fuck it is im doing with my life. im spending £10 a day just to pass the time when i could be doing something constructivefor free. fuck this fuck weed and fuck any urge to smoke. and then it clicked. i have this urge to smokebut that urge stems from that idea. the idea that smoking will be fun. ive smoked enough to know that itll be nothing like that so the urge in a sense becomes moot. that urge means fucking nothing because i know getting stoned just makes me feel like shit these days. the idea of smoking weed is great. but for someone who ends up smoking all day everyday it just isnt. if anyone read all this shit thanks. if youre struggling stay strong. we got this.,sadness
this will be the first 420 in 4 years that i will not smoke weed you know what i realised i have a perfectionist problem. my body yearns to be the best does not matter what. mathematics i have to be the greatest. writing lookin at albert camus right here. music nobody knows better tracks than i do i could go on and on. you know what is the problem i was never the best at anything. as a matter of fact i never gave it a shot. why its hard. anyone who ever tried to pick up a skill knows the frustration of the learning period of the countless hours lost in picking up the basics of a craft of learning on your mistakes. point is it is important to let yourself experiment and see what works. if it does not work the first time it might work the 10th. see i do not know this feeling. every time i tried to get involved into a hobby or skill i would quit on the first real obstacle. ca not play this song after practicing for 20 minutes give up the guitar there is no point if youre not going to be the new jimi hendrix. you ca not solve the math problem at hand from the first try must be too hard to solve look up the solution. looking back weed never made me an unmotivated perfectionist. i always had it in me ever since elementary school. the problem is that weed made me okay with being that. it taps into this basic primal urge of constant change in a human the kind of change which forces you to pick up a skill to try and hook up with girls to go out and experience nature by shutting it down. why be the best when you can let a person whos born to be the best fulfill their destiny just be average there is no shame in that except when you quit. suddenly you start looking around and see all of your friends playing an instrument drawing in their spare time writing poetry exploring on foot. what do you do in your spare time spend it on some godforsaken part of youtube you did not even now exists. oh look a speedrun of a game you have no interest of ever playing more interesting than the book at your bedside youve been planing to read for months but never got to do it. scrolling through social media to see new posts from people you absolutely do not give a shit about on things which could not interest you less better than picking up the guitar and practicing. looking back i lied by saying that i was not the best at anything. i am the best at avoiding living. i am the best at giving excuses. i am the best at lying to myself. been sober for 17 days and plan on staying sober for months to come. i might not be the best but i will become the best i can be.,joy
2 years sober today no joke.,anger
for the love of god do not start drinking after quitting it makes the withdrawal that much worse,anger
dealer ghosted me and hopefully gave me the kick i need. so i sorted to meet my dealer at 8 hes a 90 minute drive away and i normally pick up a months worth. so i jump in my car and the battery is dead. i then take the battery out of my sos car with permission which took about 15 mins of frantic knuckle scuffing nail bleeding rushing only to drive there and get ghosted.id already said that i was going to stop. this was going to be my last ride but it turns out hes accelerated my plans to stop. the whole journey backs was half wtf am i going to do followed by this is exactly what i needed.if anything i feel a bit liberated. its strange if hed called me 2 mins after i left to drive home i may not be sitting here typing this. but the annoyance of changing a car battery and driving for what turned into 2 hours made me really think about it all. he called me 10 mins after id started driving back and it was a close call. i hit a roundabout im from the uk and in that moment i decided no this is something i need to do. like many people here im a very well functioning addict. good job great income bad addiction. its been years since i got high but i smoked every night. the diminishing returns are real and im looking forward to a clean life going forward. ill still smoke one if offered but i really really want to break the every day habit. thanks for reading if you got this far. edit thanks for all the support people ill take the avoid social smoking seriously as it triggered a memory that the reason i got back into smoking was when i first quit for about 3 months about 5 years ago i started a new job and thats where i met the guy and decided to have one and then i got his dealers number. its genuinely helpful to get this support so thanks again.,joy
day 16 of not smoking. have been smoking almost every day for the last year. im 18 years old so its sad that my relationship with weed went downhill at such a young age but im motivated to maintaining sober. edit this is my first post on reddit and i joined because i saw some of the post in this community. its amazing all of the support people give in here. most people in my life either dont care or judge me. thanks for all the support this is an amazing place.,joy
for those thinking they can moderate your use you might be able to do it well shit i was able to do it. i was weed free for 75 days then i relapsed and thought i could moderate it. and i did i only did it on weekends max once per week since the new years. was it worth it hell fucking no. every time i smoked i woke up like an airhead and i always end up fucking hating my decision to smoke. i could be clear headed and motivated but no i decided to smoke. so i come back here today on my second day of quitting and hopefully this will be the last time ill have to quit again. if you want to be your true self weed cant be in the equation at least for me. thanks for reading,joy
day 365 i made it a year today marks 1 year without cannabis thank you to this community for the love support. this journey has not been easy but it gets easier all the time. for those interested in how i got this far i small chunked it. i started with a plan of making it 1 year but from 0 to a year is a giant leap. i quit 1 day at a time. sometimes i got cravings they usually went away by the time i woke up. weirdly i got cravings as far as 250 days into my quit. it feels a little surreal i know i have not smoked for a whole year it used to be such a big thing for me now i do not evenue give a shit about the stuff. for those of you who are beggining or on this journey struggling remember nobody is cut from a different cloth if i can do it you have the power in yourself to accomplish the same thing. working out is massive has changed my life all on its own.,surprise
trust me when i say time is leaving fast. started smoking when i was in high school turned 27 in april and i look back and i fucking regret it so hard it will take everything from you when you are on your death bed do you want to look back on your life and a lot of it was smoking to cover up your problems and emotions i have been clean for a couple of months now and i feel like the true me the person i should have been all along. i have new life goals and i want to pursue a new career and going to go back to school. our live here is very short spend your time wisely achieve your goals and help others. do not look back on your life and have it be a haze.,joy

its weird to have dreams every night again. i never remembered my dreams when i was smoking this is so crazy.,fear
stop counting and start living i read this tip on here some person in the comments said this. one guy was happy cause he reached a certain milestone and somebody answered stop counting and start living. for me personally this has been the best advice ever. when i first tried to stop i gave myself milestones like a month or two months but this justified trying again cause maybe i learned to control it now. as many of you know that is a lie. anyway with milestones i feel like im forcing myself to think about the substance and unintentionally keeping it a part of my life. but i want to get rid of it. and to stop counting and start living has been the single best thing to keep in mind for me. when i ask myself now how long has it been i push that away and answer to myself it does not matter im living now. now this tip may not be for you maybe setting goals with dates is simply the best approach for you. but if that has never worked try this approach stop counting and start living. obviously i know when i stopped 16 days ago a bigger stop than ive had in years and its good to know. but to think about it everyday has usually set me up for failure. im sorry if this mental approach does not help you but it sure is helping me moving on from weed.,joy
two weeks without any cannabis after being a heavy daily user for 10 years the first week or so of sleepless nights sucked ass plus i barely ate anything now im having 3 healthy meals a day plus falling asleep easy and getting my 7 8 hrs without it. feeling good edit just want to say i really appreciate all the kind words and good vibes. never thought id ever be posting on this sub but im very glad i am now.,joy
trauma is the real gateway things like cannabis caffeine and alcohol are not the gateways. things like molestation childhood abuse neglect and trauma are the real gateways. these things manifest into addiction hyper sexuality violent tendencies self harm etc. all of these things are the symptoms not the cause of a much larger issue. all of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. this is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications do not typically work. we need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from self. addiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. this behavior is then difficulty to give up. we need to realize that addiction is not a choice addiction is not an inherited disease. addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. i think so many can agree if able to put their egos aside that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodiesminds especially when children cannot comprehend or process. these past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. when we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. im sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be overworking shopping unhealthyover eating gambling sex drama codependent relationships etc we need to come together and stop judging one another. we need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. this is a sign of strength not weakness. trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease. trauma is the real gateway.,sadness
my life has changed beyond my expectations since quitting. i post pretty regularly because it feels great to express how good this quitting has been for me and in order to inspire you to do so as well. whats different cleaner house. better diet. improved sleep. better marriage. calmer life overall. lack of shame in myself for my addicted behavior. sense of pride in beating an addiction. improved memory. increased compassion for people close to me who struggle with addiction. better able to handle situations in public without anxiety. this is at 14 weeks clean. good luck to all on this path.,joy
when we quit weed when we quit weed we are not quitting the weed itself we are quitting that 1 3 hours of escape from our daily lives that has slowly become our life. we are quitting the warmth of the smokevapor in our hands and mouths the comfort of holding something and being held in the soothing embrace of mary jane. we are quitting the clouding of emotions investment and clarity we are quitting avoiding confrontation complexity and real acceptance. too often we forget there is a reason why we start and forget those reasons are waiting for us when we stop. step one is to stop smoking. step two is to start living. take it easy fam 😎,joy
been living with my friends who smoke but seeing how their lives revolve around weed makes me want to stay sober in abscense of other living arrengements i moved in with my good mates who smoke plenty of weed. almost as much as me when i was smoking and just as compulsively. before moving in i had my doubts but after a week ive turned down a chance to smoke countless times already. and i do not want to smoke any more than i did three weeks ago. in fact seeing my mates lives revolving around getting high makes me want to stay sober. i enjoy my life without constantly having to source the strongest pot and therefore being endlessly broke. i enjoy having a clear mind and waking up in the morning without sandpaper in my eyes and throath. i enjoy not having those anxiety loops as much as before. living with my friends reminds me of my own habit and all the shit i put myself through because of it. almost half a year down and im really proud of myself.,joy
i was so close to caving today its almost unbelievable but i didnt. dont know how but i didnt. thought about everyone commenting on my 10 day promise and i will not let you all down see you in 7 days,anger
wish i had listened. i remember the day i smoked weed for the very first time in freshman year of high school when i was 14 years old. i was sitting in science class and my friend told me that he was about to score some weed after school and asked if i wanted to smoke some. i said hell yes and we started talking about it. our science teacher overheard our conversation and came up to us and said you are wasting your youth and you are going to waste your life with that crap. we laughed at him rolled our eyes and made fun of him behind his back. we thought that what he said was total nonsense. flash forward. i am 32 years old. been smoking for 18 years addicted to marijuana for 12 years. guess what i did waste my youth and my adult life getting high. anyway i am on day 16 right now. i quit in the past several times but have always relapsed. back here on leaves hoping to find some connection and support,anger
10 years smoking weed everyday. im 25 now and coming to the harsh realization it has completely ruined me. disclaimer this is my first post be gentle. telling my story in the hopes that i can move forward and begin recovering. ive smoked weed and drank heavily since i was 15. im the product of two neglectful abusive parents but despite a difficult home life i always felt i was quite resilient as a child. i remember praising myself often for being able to smile through the pain i was enduring. i considered my young self an overachiever and a people pleaser. i was always very outgoing was able to manage a lot of friend groups. i was on the honor roll every year and excelled at every sport i tried. that all changed dramatically after i tried smoking weed in high school. i loved the feeling of getting high. it was an escape from all the inner demons i was trying to silently battle. i very quickly became emotionally dependent. i stopped going to class only attending to smoke weed with my friends. to make a long story short i did this throughout my entire high school career and ended up being expelled but i did not really care. i became withdrawn from people judgemental and anxious. between then and now ive had surprisingly good careers and been successful in a lot of aspects despite this. but ive always had this feeling id break one day. i could only hide my bad habits and mental state for so long. that break finally came when i had my first panic attack on board a plane coming home from a vacation and got violently sick. it was the first vacation id been on in 9 years and rather than enjoying myself i dealt with crazy anxiety and what i would assume was withdrawal from weed. all i could think about was getting home so i could finally smoke again. ive been paranoid and horribly sick to my stomach every day since. my anxiety has been through the roof i wake up at 4am daily and i often think im going to die soon. because of this i have been smoking 2 3 bowls every hour or so to surpress the overload im experiencing. ive completely withdrawn from the world since. ive lost most of my friends i do not have any hobbies that require leaving my house and i work from home which does not help. im even having terrible anxiety thinking about posting this at this point ive realized that a vast majority of shitty events in my life and bad mental habits are centered around weed and alcohol. ive since quit drinking and am now 5 weeks sober in that regard and i desperately want to quit smoking weed too. ive just ran out of weed today and am heading to visit with a new doctor in an hour. im hopeful that today is the day i can finally be strong enough to turn a new leaf. update hey guys i wanted to pop on here with an update and say thank you for all the kind encouraging messages here. i do not have many friends left to talk to so to know i have a supportive and safe place here is a really nice feeling. the doctor prescribed me a very low dose of anti anxiety and depression medication. i have a moderate fear of prescription medication so im noticing im a lot more on edge and hypersensitive to how my body is feeling. i also feel like im just replacing one numbing substance with another. tonight was the third day taking a half dose and the initial side effects suck. the highlight is temporary i hope heightened anxiety so i have a lot of moments of panic where i ca not tell if im breathing. kind of weird but everything is feeling kind of weird right now so im taking it day by day. i decided against quitting cold turkey. i got through one day but combining withdrawal symptoms with the side effects of starting this new medication was way too much to handle. im kicking myself for that a bit but i know i will get there eventually. just a little slower. i switched from smoking a strain with 18 thc between 10 15 times a day to a strain with less than 4 thc and 14 cbd about 5 times a day. ive been struggling to eat or keep anything down so this has helped drastically with calming my nerves enough to get some food down. my plan is to wean myself off of this cbd gradually over the next week or so. maybe more. i realize im kind of navigating this as i go now this feels very different from quitting drinking. im going back to my doctor in a week and a half for a check in so i will update then on my progress thank you all again for being so kind and welcoming of my story and struggles. i appreciate the openness here ♥️,joy
the last nug soi thought all my weed was gone but i was wrong. i was cleaning and just found a really nice nug that i hid away for myself a little while back. i just did what i thought i was never capable of doing and i flushed that mother down the toilet. i have never ever felt so strong before. i smelled it touched it and kissed his sorry ass goodbye. i am so proud of me. trust me if i can do it you can too.,joy
its not the substance itself this happened to me today. im a full month without smoking. today i had to light something up and i caught the lighter. it was like meeting an old friend. the feeling of it in my hands its weight it just felt good. the weed did not even took part on this sensation at all. so it struck me. we are addicted to a substance yes. but the ritual itself takes a huge part on the addiction. it makes you feel you in the control because its aways the same thing and makes you feel you have some kind of company the lighter the pipe the weed all imaginary friends. this mindset feels more reasonable for me. youre not fighting against an evil chemical thats imprisoning you. you fighting against habbits that you build for yourself. so all you gotta do is build another habbits. i know its hard but changing a habbit for a habbit seems more achievable than changing a chemical for a habbit right at least for me. hope this insight helps you somehow. good journey my friends,joy
i had my first marijuana anonymous meeting via zoom yesterday. ive never felt so supported. 12 step programs seem to get a bad rap. i was very sceptical especially since i used to be religious and theres alot of what seems like god bothering in the 12 promises. but you know what i joined the meeting and not one person in the group was religious. they had all found their own defenition of what that meant to them. after one meeting i have people messaging me encouraging me to say sober. im only on day 2 but after years of smoking im feeling hopeful for my future. never forget that rleaves and groups like ma are genuinely saving lives and youre saving lives by being an active part of the community. im grateful for all of you.,joy
everyday smoker since age 15 i am 38 now. dont even know who i am without pot. never tried to quit before. but its like cmon ive smoked enough in my life to stop now. been biting my fingernails like crazy all day. on hour 7 ugh i just watched alice in wonderland cartoon and literally every character smokes. idk what im going to do tonight. not trying to drink alcohol to fall asleep. pot has been a part of my everyday life for over 20 years idk who i am at all or how to deal with my feelings. its very sad. but im still going to try. ill keep updating my progress. thank you for being here.,sadness
the withdrawal sucks and i love it i love that i barely slept in the past week and have no appetite. i love throwing up. i love the lack of joy in anything at the moment. i love that i cursed out my boss last night. i love the mood swings and headaches. i love my shitty gym progress cause im physically depleted. i love that no one around me cares or understands weed dependency i love that im finally fucking fighting and not accepting the life ive been living. learn to love what youre going through because youre doing what so many will never even attempt. god bless you all,sadness
getting tested for lung disease in an hour and nobody knows been using thc carts off and on for a few years took a few month break started up again. and i wish i never had. i started feeling something different in what felt like my right lung. it kept progressing and now im getting tests done. honestly after reading all these stories online about thc carts causing insanely serious illnesses and death ill admit it ive never been this scared in my life. even if by some miracle i come out of it fine i never want to feel this fear again. the worst part is i have nobody to talk to im just completely alone in my head right now telling my self its gonna be ok. im just disgusted at myself that i risked my own health to this extent over a stupid short high what did it get me nothing. if only i knew then what i know now. if your reading this and you have a cart in your room throw that fing thing out for your own good. its not worth the risk. i know this sounds all doom and gloom but its the truth and people need to hear it. please watch out for yourselves update first thanks for all the support. i just got back they did a bunch of breathing tests chest x ray and some other stuff. they said something was going on but they arent sure what yet. the tests should come back soon here. some people have suggested anxiety and i hope thats all it is but it hurts to cough and theres a constant pain in my chest even when relaxed and thats a big coincidence for it to start right after clearing a couple maine lives over a couple weeks so well see what they say tomorrow. ill update again when u get more info,fear
moderation does not exist for addicts. the belief that i could one day moderate literally lead me to decades of continued use. the same process that saw you addicted in the first place is alive and well within you after you stop. its easy to keep at bay when not using weed but its easily reignited with any amount of weed. it might not happen over night though it might happen that way too but eventually youll be back at your old levels or possibly worse.,sadness
four years i made it my friends. four years free from drugs and alcohol after 11 years of daily marijuana use. four years ago i chose to enroll in an intensive outpatient substance abuse rehabilitation program. the sessions were two hours twice a week for one year. i was exposed to people from all walks of life all of us united by our shared experience of addiction. the knowledge base was tremendous. it changed my life. i am grateful for my family. they are rock solid. they have put up with a lot of my bullshit but they never abandoned me. i want to thank this wonderful community. you are a constant source of insight strength and resolve. i am an addict but i will not smoke today. i wake up every morning and i climb the mountain. climb it with me. edit thank you so much for the kind words. you all have helped make this day very special. edit 2 thank you for the platinum abeydube my first reddit award.,joy
day 15 after 15 years of daily smoking. some thoughts on sobriety so far. this is the longest ive gone without weed. here are some positives ive noticed from quitting so far im more confident. my social anxiety is totally gone. im sleeping better than ever and loving the vivid dreams. i do not like video games as much as i thought i did. i do not enjoy sitting around like i used to. id rather be out doing something. my house has never been so clean. i do not cough anymore. im eating a lot less craving healthy foods and losing weight. im happier i find myself smiling more and laughing at random things. my road rage has disappeared and im less irritable. im thinking much more clearly and have better focus. im still dealing with random cravings but theyre getting more manageable every day. thanks to everyone on this sub for the support.,joy

im convinced that weed is my fucking devil. day 7 maaan i left the house today to run some errands and for the first time in many months i wasnt anxious doing it. holly fuuuck man. also im actually able to articulate myself properly in relativly fast paced face to face conversation. weed is totally not for me. im to receptible to being addicted and im socially awkward and anxious to begin with so why did i think holding myself back with this fucking drug was doing me any good thank you so much to this sub and everyone here you can do it there is something much better waiting for you it truly gets better every day if youre feeling bad right now keep in mind that its okay to do nothing today as long as youre staying sober im getting a lot of benefits and im only on day 7 im so much more motivated to actually change my life for the better and its only gonna get better from here i love you,sadness
1st day successfully sober and crying like a baby back again. creep my previous posts if you so choose. context 4 years use approximately a gram of bong rips a day every single day. yesterday was the full moon. i wrote a goodbye letter to weed and finally made the decision to quit. for good. never smoking again quit. i dont smoke weed anymore quit. i wrote those words out in my journal probably 100 times in an effort to rewire my brain against smoking. it actually helped. just saying it out loud my addict brain was like heehee okay sure bud but writing it over and over and over kind of forced the denial out of me. theres weed in the living room my roommates. i even put away the bong this morning but i didnt smoke nor even wanted to. weed is a fond but terrible memory of the past. ive done everything to change my mindset and ive promised myself that no reason will ever be sufficient to smoke— another thing i wrote out over and over. it has simply taken too much from me so i know i have two choices let it continue to steal from me or say goodbye. life a or life b so day 1 my last goodbye hoot was yesterday. this morning im supposed to be in class but instead im crying like a baby about all the feelings i used weed to numb. its it sucks. better out than in i suppose update made it to day two. instead of crying im just puking today🤤🥴🤢 ps. gatorade is my new best friend,sadness
5 months without cannabis after 10 years of smoking i started smoking on the weekends when i was 16 with a few friends just for fun. i did not enjoy drinking and hated the flavour of beer and how bloated alcohol made me feel. i am an overthinker so the weed helped surpress that. when i left school and started working all of the responsibilties made my brain more active than when i was in my teenage years i started smoking a lot more due to this and i never even realised i became dependant on it. i am 25 now and over the past few years i started to get severe anxiety when high and also sober which never happened before i started smoking this is the complete opposite effect of the previous 7 8 years of smoking. when locksdowns started happening in march i was a little relieved it gave me a reason to stop both weed and cigarettes. since locksdowns have loosened i have been with friends that still smoke and i declined. the first few weeks were hell due to the increase in anxiety symptoms but i am now over that and i feel great my anxiety is much lower lungs are healing smell better and thoughts feel less clouded. i am curently trying to train myself to use my overthinking in my advantage rather than disadvantage. i know its not good to subtitute but i now give myself friday or saturday to have a few sweet alcoholic drinks still hate beer just to get a little buzz. thanks for listening,joy
currently attempting cold turkey on a remote tropical island. update original post finally snapped. on the spur of the moment i quit my job and used all my savings to buy myself a ticket to a tiny island in the philippenes. been here 10 days so far. 50 days until my return flight. probably a shitty descision but im commited now. tldr started great plateaued looking for solidarity and others in a similar stage of withdrawal. background which im sure is all too familiar to many of you 26yo 9 years of being stoned first joint 630 am before i get out of bed etc. tried and failed to quit more times than i can count. zero ability to moderate mentally torturing myself every night for wasting another day of this precious life. for most of my life ive been focussed on the external world flitting from one exciting thing to the next searching for those little dopamine hits jumping at every opportunity agreeing to everthing. never even taken a day to concentrate on myself. ive been high almost every day since i was 17 thus i have not allowed myself to mature emotionally or socially since then. do not even know how to deal with my emotions while sober. weed allowed me to escape boredom to be happy doing nothing. suspect some underlying cause to this perhaps mild adhd. despite my addiction ive managed to start building a successful career in industrial design but i know im operating at like 20 capacityeffiency. time and time again i tried to quit and time and time again i failed. i might make it a week or two but then worksocial would get stressful and my willpower would evaporate. logic behind desert island rehab did not feel like my addiction warranted conventional rehab reinforced by the its only weed dude attitude society seems to have. debatable choice but that was the descision. i also know i will feel far more proud of myself if i manage to do it on my own. i decided i needed a new environment without any stress or commitments where my only goal would be making it through each day without getting high. somewhere i could slowly build a routine back into my life start exercising start reading again etc. somewhere with an exciting environment to explore once i was ready. i did not want to be around friends or family during this time. im easily distracted and i felt i needed to force myself to concentrate only on myself for an extended period of time. i also know i get very irratable when i try to quit and i did not want to inflict that on those i love and wear them down. i also knew i wanted some creature comforts internet to aid in boredom and to communicate with friends when i need healthy cheap food on tap warm weather the sea to swim in a bit of the easy life. im aware that im essentially running away from my problems and i will have to face real life again when i get back but i felt like i needed to press the reset button to snap myself out of the spiral something i could not do at home. in line with another post i just saw here when im sober i want to smoke and when im high i want to quit. i reasoned that buying a ticket during a moment of clarity would force me to adhere to that descision and not just forget it the next morning. so i departed armed with vallium a kindle a laptop and a hammock. experience so far its so interesting the psychological state you enter when you just know you ca not get weed. cravings and temptation have not been an issue. im aware that i ca not rely on the lack of avaliblity of weed for ever but i hope ill be strong enough to resist when i return physically ive been a sweaty little mess cracking headaches etc but for me the scariest part is insomnia but ive managed that with vallium tapered it off from 20mg down to nothing currently have had two nights sleep without any chemical aid. feels great. who knew it was so easy to get up in the morning feeling my brain come back online has been amazing. mental clarity the ability to hold a conversation even the desire to converse with strangers the ability to maintain eye contact the ability to present a genuine smile. the island im on is tiny maybe 1km long. it has a village of about 50 people palm forests crystal clear water and a jungly mountain at one end. im in a hut next to the beach with good lte and some food stalls within walking distance. food and accommodation is costing me about 20 a day. paradise apart from the nearby typhoon but you ca not have everthing i guess i started out with vigour excercise attempted yoga delving into my books. but ive plateaued and the past few days ive been escaping into netflix and my motivation to do anything else has evaporated. this would usually be when i would relapse. not possible here and im glad ive given myself so long out here. not gonna be as easy as i thought. emotional wobblies started yesterday inexplicably found myself in tears. all the things i used to enjoy are not appealing. hours building playlists days fiddling around making tracks on logic or designs in illustrator i just ca not motivate myself. the hardest part is the evening. usually i would be succumbing to the blissful fog of a hard days smoking but without weed i just do not know how to relax. i hope this phase passes. i know this will pass. but this is probably why rehab is best done in a group so you can support each other during times like this. if anyone has read this ramble thank you i do not know quite why im writing it probably in search of solidarity or another person going through the same stage of withdrawal. very much up for dm ing if anyones keen. maybe i wrote it to remind myself why im here. having done so and re read my words i suddenly feel like i can manage to get up and do 20 mins of exercise. funny how the brain works. good luck to everyone else out there trying to quit. we got this edit i have been totally bowled over by the outpouring of support from this community. to know there are so many people out there in similar positions all able to coalesce into this mutually beneficial network all rooting for one another all at different stages of the process all willing to offer insightful advice and comforting encouragement what a phenomenon. i feel totally re invigorated im not just doing it for myself now im also doing for all of you. were all doing it for each other. im prepared for the rest of the rollercoaster and im hanging on tight. alsomy first and second silvers all in 24 hrs thank you kind strangers i totally assumed this post was going to be lost to the chasm. rleaves you guys are awesome will update. update,joy
a way to respond to cravings that is really effective for me by saying one simple phrase if i smoke now ill want to smoke again in 20 minutes. if i dont smoke now ill want to smoke again in 20 minutes. if its your first time seeing that please stop reading for one minute and let the phrase soak in. what does it mean cement the concept in your head. get the ah ha moment so it sticks. and then read below what does this mean for me smoking actually wont satisfy my craving i think it will but ill just have another. so im better off not smoking and getting the same result having another. it has saved me countless times. i hope that helps some people. definitely not an original but strong enough i had to share it. hope this helps,joy
realising it is not for me had 5 weeks weed free after being a stoner for the better part of 7 years. moved interstate to work and didnt have a hookup so it was not even an option for the past 5 weeks which made it very easy. got back yesterday and me and my partner decided to get high after she joined me in sobriety. all it did was make me very anxious stupid was questioning everything i was saying as i was so stoned and always thought i was not making sense. very very slow in my thinkingreplying processes and not able to focus on tasks at hand in a smart and effective manner. in my sobriety i found myself in many social scenarios where i may not have been a social butterfly or extroverted but goddammit i was comfortable with the silence and not anxious at all. i dont want to smoke anymore. i want to be quick witted smart and good at decision making,fear
feeling proud hit 6 months sober today after a 15 year addiction thanks for all the help and support over the months from people here it has really helped me become a much better version of myself,joy
best high of my life stopped counting but its gotta be close to 4 months or something without the whacky backy and i have a major success story to share. 3 4 months ago i was ready to quit my studies because i jsut couldnt hack it anymore. lots of support discipline and not having my productivity stifled by weed later i have completed all the assignments i needed to do to catch up on things i fell behind on in my master degree. i have never produced a piece of work i am more proud of i estimate i put a couple of hundred hours of work and life force into it and it has payed off massively. i cannot remember the last time i felt this good stone cold sober looking at over 100 pages of analyses i made and tonnes of excel sheets. i am now completely back on track and ready to tackle the final part of my degree the master thesis. i am certain that i would have never made it to this milestone if i did not make the decision to quit no more nagging guilty feelings and pressure. this subreddit is in no small part to thank for this success story thank you all for posting your stories. they have helped immensely the people on their first day posting about the struggle to remind me why i cant go back to my old ways the success stories of people turning their lives around to give me hope the stories of relapse that served as a stark reminder and warning the funny stories that contrast the serious nature of the subreddit and of course the posts offering fantastic advice of how to cope without weed. thats it i guess mission accomplished and off to work on the next milestone. i was worried that when i get to this point where i have some respite and time to relax that id wanna smoke but now that im here i have 0 desire to do so. i just wanna sleep and play video games for 3 days straight before attacking my next project. all the best to yall.,joy
if i give weed an inch it will take a mile moderation does not work for me. never has and never will. if i let the little monster talk me into a puff i might as well be conceding the next month of my life. do not listen to the little monster. why would this time be any different,anger
2 years without weed just want to let you all know that there is hope. 🙂 i dropped out of high school to become an addicted loser who would smoke an ounce every week at my parents house and treating everyone around me like trash. ever since quitting 2 years ago i realise its been the best years of my life so far. im closer to my family more than ever before and ive almost finished my bachelors degree. at this point ive improved myself so much that ive completely eliminated the desire for weed and im 100 i will never willingly smoke it again. but im far from perfect i recently got into alcohol and going to be fighting that too. also i still never want weed when im drunk. just dont give up though all you need is faith in yourself. youll be very surprised at how much life will reward you.,joy
420 days ago today i took my last drag and beat a 6 year daily smoking habit. this community helped me do it. id like to return the favour. as the title says i have been 420 days without weed today. as this is a special number for us current stoners or ex stoners i thought it might be a good opportunity to offer to repay the immense support and comfort that this community provided me when i desperately needed it. i know from experience how difficult it is to kick the habit. so if you want someone to speak to someone to check in on how youre doing from time to time just a few tips to get you started or anything else just comment here or dm me. i want to help stay strong.,joy
i finally did it i told my mum who i live with that ive been secretly smoking weed every night for years and i desparately want to quit. she was super understanding and is going to help me however she can. ive deleted my dealers numbers and thrown out all my smoking stuff. ive already been sober for a month but i kept telling myself it was temporary that i would smoke again once lockdown was over. but now that im sober ive realised i actually quite like not depending on weed. i could not have made this decision without reading all the amazing supportive encouraging posts on this sub. edit hoooooly shit i was not expecting this post to blow up like this o.o thank you for all your comments of support it really means a lot. i know i may be coming off as naive or overly positive but i figured its best to be optimistic in a situation like this.,joy
took a hit after 8mos sober. i was at a friends house and feeling pretty sure that id be able to smoke socially without re upping and craving to smoke again. well i could not have been more right we were playing smash bros and after i hit the pipe i could not even focus on the game. i started to feel overwhelmed so i went to chill on his balcony while they played more matches. i watched the cars go by on the highway and tried to keep my heart rate down so anxious and stuck inside my head. before i knew it half an hour had passed. i felt better physically but was upset to be missing out on time with friends. i went back inside was able to focus again and had some good hangout time. but i felt so sluggish and cloudy even hours later. what a great reminder of why i ever quit.,fear
740 days clean havent looked back since,joy
broke my one month streak last night valuable lesson taught. hey rleaves my name is dylan and i wanted to share my experience with life without marijuana. i decided to quit smoking marijuana last month after smoking non stop daily for a whole year. i decided to go the cold turkey route to show my body that depending on marijuana is not a good thing. for two weeks straight i was dealing with major withdrawals waking up in the middle of the night with major anxiety and cold sweats. i pushed through however and it was the best decision i ever made. that was until last night. i hung out with a friend who quit around the same time as i did and gave me his final nug. i asked if he still wanted his final nug. he told me i could have it and do whatever i wanted with it he just did not want marijuana to be around him anymore. i took it home last night and unfortunately decided to smoke a small bowl because its for old times sake. big. mistake. almost immediately after i began feeling anxiety levels that ive never felt in my life. my heart felt weird my body felt weird the high just was not the same. i decided to knock out thinking that sleeping it off would help me calm down. i woke up around 430 today still feeling the anxiety. i can officially say that im done with marijuana. i hate getting high. its no longer the fun experience that it was to me before. its become a scary experience one that i would no longer want to feel. i threw away the nug immediately after waking up. my body has finally agreed with me. my life with sobriety has just started but hopefully my story can help out others that are just beginning like me. marijuana addiction is horrible and i would never want anybody else to feel what im feeling right now. edit missed key detail,fear
one year weed free today it was not easy especially the first 2 3 months but i made it a year i struggled with paws for a while but that is mostly behind me. at the beginning i really was in a bad place it seemed like i experienced all the possible withdrawal symptoms and they were all turned up to 11. i struggled with anxiety depression lack of appetite inability to sleep when i eventually was able to sleep i would have night terrors waking up in sweat headaches brain fog etc. you name it i experienced it. for the first 90 or so days i thought i was broken and stuck that way let me tell you it gets better. i now experience legitimate happiness i am no longer depressed and i can sleep an entire night. for those reading this trust me it gets better.,sadness
day 600 today is day 600 sober for me. weed is my drug of choice do not have issues with anything else. i have no moderation or control over it. its an all or nothing for me. used for 10 years. the last 4 5 of that being very heavy all day every day use. basically the routine of smoking before and during everything. attempted to quit multiple times only to be fooled thinking i could use in moderation. which would turn right back into smoking all day everyday. got to a point where i was ready to quit for good. so i started meditating every day for a month or two until i ran out. knowing meditation would help me through the month or so of withdraws. and it definitely did. kept up on meditating daily which really helped keep me sober. several months after quitting i got a significantly better job getting my foot in the door to a great career. which has been a big help as well. if i can quit and stay quit anyone can. not saying its easy because its not. i just tried until i found what works for me and keeps me off of it.,joy
using weed in moderation impossible for me totally abstaining is the only thing that works 12 years 9 months cannabis free after smoking weed for around ten years my use had become too heavy and habitual for my liking. i tried to use it in moderation only on special occasions was what i was going for. thanks to documenting my progress in a journal i was eventually able to go back and see how often id slipped back to daily use. it felt so maddening to realize that id become addicted to this totally non addictive substance. it took ten years of trying and failing miserably to smoke weed like someone who can take it or leave it i was so envious of people who could do this. for me if i had it in the house it would get smoked sooner of later. i had to come to the realization that i was not capable of smoking cannabis without relapsing back to daily use. i found a lot of helpful info online and even joined an online support forum the name is uncommon knowledge forum based in the uk. online community support like whats being offered here was the thing that allowed me to actually quit. reading posts by other people who actually understand the struggle that we love weed but its no longer serving us and we desperately want to quit but a small part of us still wants to be able to smoke it now and then. the posts id read by other people with problematic habitual weed use rang so true for me validating my own experience. i no longer felt like some isolated weirdo with a problem i was facing alone i felt like what i was going through was real and that others were facing the exact same struggle. my battle felt a bit less overwhelming. i started a list of benefits of being off weed on the forum. other people added their insights. by encouraging each other to see all the positives of quitting the days off weed started to string together. i learned some basic tips to stay cannabis free stay busy do things that bring me joy even at first i felt like a fraud since there was little joy in the early days surround myself with people who care about me avoid situations that are going to trigger me i.e. being super drunk or hungover around people who are smoking weed treat myself to little rewards with the money i saved. i am proud to say that after all those failed attempts at moderation this time i have fully quit. i never want to jinx it and say that ive successfully quit forever since there are times when i still get phantom cravings or weird addict rationalizations about how its been so long you can have a toke now and not relapse. i have been off cannabis since july 22 2006. i still count my progress in years and months now not days and i want to share my story. with weed now legal where i live and dispensaries selling product near my house i need to re up my commitment to stay off. it was fun during the first years i smoked it but it turned into a limiting addiction slowly squeezing the juice of life from my existence. now after 12 years and 9 months tomorrow off weed my life is better than ever. i want to say thanks to all of you in this community. by showing up authentically sharing our stories and offering support when asked we help each other leave our weed habits behind and move into living our lives more fully.,anger
i went the entirety of 2018 without consuming cannabis so happy about that 😇👏🏻👏🏻,joy
leaving rleaves im once again quitting something but this time its rleaves and not because im going back to the herb. its because you guys are my one reminder at this point of what ive given up. a week ago i stopped counting up the days id quit and started counting the days until i had a project due the days until a midterm the days until fallout 4 arrived. youve given me this power now i need to stop dragging myself down by feeling nostalgic when i see leaves weird right thank you all so much for your support and effort even if you did not realize you were giving it. i shall continue to advise those that are having a hard time. i just do not think i need to be part of something meant for quitting. ive already passed quitting. now i just need to keep living.,love
3 tips for success what worked for me to finally kick the habit for good 32m smoking daily for 16 years. now 60 days sober after years of failed attempts. here are my 3 keys to success. i hope it helps you 1. keep track of your streak and closely follow it. there are countless apps to help remind you when was your last smoke. the bigger the streak the harder it becomes to break. if you are a gamer think of it like a video game high score. do not keep a mental note. download an app and add a widget or notification so youre reminded every day the current streak. streaks that are kept in your head are easier to break. 2. decide you are not just someone trying to quit but that you are no longer a smoker. act like you are no longer a smoker. it makes it way easier to quit when youve made the mental decision that you are not a smoker. people who do not smoke do not ask for hits call their dealer engage in cannabis content bring weed to every activity. its simply not part of their life. fake it til you make it. you are not quitting smoking. you are simply not a smoker. 3. after you are on a streak even a day reflect back and ask yourself if you wished you smoked since the last time. do you wish you spent money on the weed you did not smoke is the high worth being in a worse cognitive state than you are now 99.99 of the time the answer is no. after 30 days you will feel so much sharper and have hundreds of extra dollars in your pocket. it will be hard to look back and say you wish you spent this money and that the high was worth it. hope this helps someone,joy
best decision ever i posted on here on my 9th day. i was struggling and in a very dark place unsure i was able to live that way. today is day 77 and im so happy i stuck with it and allowed myself to love a free life. today is my first day of college and not having to rely on weed is a dream come true. if youre struggling just keep pushing because the pain is worth the reward i promise.,sadness
sticky brain vs slippy brain heres how i think about weed and by extension all drugs and alcohol. my vice has always been weed tho. when we are born we are constantly learning and constantly remembering what we learn. our brains are naturally sticky. we keep our eyes open see the world listen to people take in all kinds of experiences and lessons from the people around us. our brain is so sticky like fly paper taking everything in. when we use drugs or alcohol to the point where it becomes habit or routine our brains lose their stickiness. and the more we use drugs for longer periods of time our brains actually become slippery. we can still see and hear whats going on around us but it does not stay in our minds. memories start to fade lessons have no meaning we no longer truly experience anything. everything just slips away in anticipation of the next toke. and so the cycle continues the good news is our brains are naturally sticky we can get back to that it just takes a little self control and a lot of support but its worth it to experience life like we used to. stay strong my friends.,joy
relapsed after 5 years. starting over tomorrow i hadnt touched weed in over 5 years until june 8th last month. life has changed drastically since i used to be a stoner and at the start this year i became increasingly intrigued with reintroducing weed for therapeutic and recreational benefits. june 8th was the day i started smoking again and heres whats happened i exercised only once since i exercise and cross train daily running cycling weight etc usually. i basically forgot that for 15yrs of my life i never worked out because weed creates a force field of contentment with laziness. ive managed to reshape my life over the last 4 years to be a generally healthier individual . i no longer identify with being a stoner but thats what ive been doing these last 3 weeks and its been amazing to realize how i used to be to how ive grown to be so lazy. so my quest to be a stoner again has yielded results. cannabis is no longer of any real benefit to me. if anything its been largely negative. people have noticed how stoned ive become. somebody picked it up at work that i was tired looking etc. i found this embarrassing. my girlfriend prefers the older version of me who looks after himself and doesnt lounge around gaining weight and struggling to stay conscious because im so monged. i have a wheeze again after 5 years or good respiratory health. ive put on over a stone in weight over the last few weeks too. damn munchies so tomorrow i start without it. exercise and healthy eating. and some sleepers for possible insomnia if needed. its time to get er done and start back in a righteous path. just thought id share.,joy

i drove to the dispensary just drove here after convincing myself to get shatter and keep it going its been 1 week relapse morning to night been sitting in the car for 30 mins trying to think this through i read multiple postscouldnt convince me i go to my notesand i literally have several full notes explaining the same thing over and over again of how much i hate weed and all the bad shit it does to me. its crazy how many times i wrote to myself over the years and i keep on relapsing. one post stood out to me. what would the highest version of me do what would someone who loves themselves do im going to drive home now with the 20 still with me. tomorrow will be day 2.,anger
working on day 48 nice to be part of the secret society of people who used to get high i have had an addiction that i have kept secret from most people for over 25 years. its nice to have a new secret. my life would be different if i had never used weed at all. but i am sort of glad to have had that phase. i sure can appreciate the clarity of a weed free existence now. positive momentum leaves,joy
im 41 years old. been struggling with marijuana addiction since i was 15. i often wonder how much more i could have accomplished in my life without this chemical crutch. im 7 months sober as we speak though ive been here many times before. i do not want to go back. i ca not go back. weed was always a prominent fixture in my rather disfunctional childhood home. i began smoking at age 14 with with my parents approval and even encouragement. its very possible that i would have still eventually developed an addiction to weed on my own without the impetus of my pot friendly home environment but now ill never know. what i do know is that in a very real sense my parents played a leading role in saddling my former innocent impressionable child self with this addiction. i find now all these years later that i carry around a lot of confusion hurt and anger toward my parents for this especially now that my own son is 15 and i cannot fathom being the poor role model for him that my parents were for me. that cycle damnit stops with me 💪 can anyone else relate to this story at all,joy
today marks 2 years weed free i smoked weed for 6 years from 16 22. i was a daily smoker pretty much from the time i began smoking. i was definitely a high functioning stoner so that made it pretty easy to excuse my habit. overtime though i just began to feel worse and worse every time i smoked. every day would blend with next i felt out of touch with myself and all of those around me. i felt like a shell of a person and i was suppressing all of my emotions with the plant. i tried to quit probably 20 times but had no success until two years ago when id become a not so functional stoner. i had dropped out of college to sell weed i partied every night and cared very little about anyone but myself. then one night that changed. i was doing what i always did sitting in a big circle in my living room me and my stoner buddies passing around a rig as we each took dabs. i had just taken a huge dab and i was dying struggling to get oxygen into my lungs. i went into the bathroom and i remember i finally got myself together and i just stared into the mirror forever and pretty much just had an epiphany. i decided i was going to quit for real this time. it was hard. i tried to maintain my friendships at first but none of them respected the fact that id quit. every time i saw them theyd ask me to smoke or smoke around me. i also realized that a lot of people hung around just because i always had so much. so i just had to cut them off all together. it was tough and lonely in the beginning. every thing id been suppressing came to the surface and i had to deal with all of it. i had a few panic attacks and started to have really bad anxiety. i was also pissed most of the time struggled to sleep and my appetite was pretty much gone. i was in a deep pit of depression. i started to exercise running a few miles every other day and that really sped things up and helped me deal with the loss of something i was addicted to. i also started to fill that time i used to smoke with more productive things like reading writing working and rekindling my relationships with my family members. the first year was incredibly challenging but since then hings have gotten progressively better. ive gotten into a committed relationship went back to school and am majoring in computer science i started writing again ive got more money saved up than i ever have in my life im happier and actually deal with my problems as they arise im more assertive and overall just a better person. so if youre struggling to quit or if youve quit and it seems like nothing is getting better just keep pushing through. smoking is not going to help your problems and its not going to make you feel any better if i can do it anyone can.,joy
i didnt smoke on my evening walk tonight ever since quarantine began ive been going for nightly walks where i would just walk around my town and smoke a joint. its lovely the peace and quiet and the good vibes. i often walk down to the river by my house and enjoy the sound of it flowing. but suddenly id remember that i was walking alone at night and that id have to sneak back into my home without getting caught smelling like weed and thats when the paranoia sets in. even though this happens almost every night i still decide to smoke. its funny how you forget the feeling the next morning just to experience it again later that night its like a loop. but tonight i felt differently. i took a joint and went for a walk but the entire time i felt like i was battling two sides of me. one side felt so deeply connected to my intuition and every part of it was telling me not to smoke but the other side kept luring me back into this loop where id tell myself tonights the last night i smoke every single night. but i fought the urge the entire walk i even extended my walk thinking id smoke but i made it home sober and much less anxious than i would have heres to a happier and more peaceful life without weed. weed will always be there but you wont heres to 2 days sober,joy
no weed alcohol or energy drinks for 41 days im hella proud of it. its always been easy for me to substitute one addiction for another only this time im committing to healthier addictions like going to the gym and eating good food. its not been easy but im getting there. if anyone needs helpsupport im always free for you to drop me a message all the best.,joy
i thought most of the problems in my life would resolve them selves when i stopped smoking turns out they are just problems i have. so ive been smoking over 10 years struggled through school escaped with weed every night for years. this year i got a great paying job and wanted to prove that i could keep this job and stay sober. well my main issues with weed were making mistakes being slow at work anxiety weight gainlazyness and mood swings. well 3 months since i have not smoked and i still have a job i still have anxiety i still make mistakes and im less chill so i get angry easier. so wtf all these issues are just me i guess weed made them worse ex anxiety was physical panic vs trouble sleeping and remembering cringe situation that make me feel bad. i do not know if i will start again but im a more present father i give the kids their baths helps them with their homework and have time to get them to school. usually i would be high and not participate in these activities. so positives and negatives will keep trying to stay sober.,sadness
being sober makes me really happy something about reclaiming and healing yourself just feels so good and motivates me to keep going.,joy
anyone else had cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome so im 22 ive been a daily green smoker for 3yrs. all of a sudden i got sick really sick after smoking one day. i i felt nauseous so i ate a salad for lunch and then proceeded to aggressively vomit that up straight away accompanied by extreme nausea. i assumed it was the food and then had another cone. then continued to vomit with ongoing nausea in between for about 8 hours. i got so dehydrated and the nausea was so awful i drove to the e.r. they told me it was gastro. so i went home and woke up feeling better. next week after smoking one day again i got the same cyclic nausea and vomiting until i drove to the e.r again. after many hours of them trying every anti nausea medication they could they asked me questions about my cannabis usage and came to the conclusion i had cannabinoid hypermesis syndrome and the only thing to stop it from happening again would be to quit. i gave up cold turkey. it was really disheartening to hear i couldnt smoke anymore since i have bpd bipolar and was something i leant on to control my emotions it was basically the only thing that connected me and my friends. but as the days went on i felt more and more positive about this happening to me and thinking it couldve been a blessing in disguise. i threw out all my paraphernalia and weed ive said no to seshes with my friends. its been 40 days. ive started to think clearer more rationally im able to express how i feel fluently and intelligently less word blanks feeling more social my dreams are cooler im thinking about my future more im taking account for my shitty decisions in my life i have more energy im being more creative open to more healthy activities realising those who smoked with me no longer served me as we were actually nothing alike and all i was doing was numbing out with them. i realised all the emotions i was suppressing wasnt actually helping anything but delaying it all to be processed and un wound when i was sober. all these events from the past are resurfacing in my mind my perceptions are changing for the better im not de motivated and have changed my eating exercise like ive been meaning to for the last 3yrs im so happy that this shitty condition was the push i needed to make this huge leap to my highest self. im pretty damn sure that i wouldve kept it as a daily for many more years and been de tracked off my real goals for who knows how long. just wanting to know how many others have experienced this condition as i havent heard anyone ever speak of it. thanks for reading first post in this awesome supportive group 💕,joy
i broke my sobriety yesterday. do not let yourself down if you give in. it is not over and you can just continue giving your best. conscience is everything. well i could use the quarantine as an excuse. but to be real here i decided to smoke again. i have not been thinking about weed for the last 4 months. turned my life around started working out took more responsibility at work spent time with my dog and rekindled a lot of social contacts. after nearly 3 years i feel good about myself again. i have a new flat it is great and everything is under control. then this fucking virus starts to cause chaos. i got i believe 1 gram of a friend of mine. yesterday i decided to smoke like half a joint from it. it was ok nothing special. it is still the same. i went to bed woke up today and continued as nothing happened. i guess since i am not planning on becoming the stoner again like from the bottom of my heart it just was not that big of a deal to me. i am not disappointed i am relieved somehow. that it did not feel as good as i thought it would. that i am fine by leaving it be and be that guy who smokes occasionally. my sobriety will continue. i will just forget about it and continue everything i got going the last few months. do not be mad at yourself. just continue with your efforts. it will get you somewhere in the end,joy
today is day 6. rough day. just got back from picking up some weed. i get a text from one of my best friends who knows im trying to quit telling me about this sub. completely changed my mind. i have been smoking weed daily for over 2 years. i tell myself its okay because i usually dont smoke til the evening. but ive realized that its one of the only things i look forward to its something that inhibits me from living my life to the fullest and actually going out and doing things. it needs to stop. i moved across country last month living in a place where im constantly surrounded by people yet i know no one except my co workers. its a strange feeling living in a place where you are constantly surrounded by people but really youre completely alone. i woke up this morning to a rainy dreary day on my day off. i havent found much to fill my time without work making my boredom painfully real and depressing. to add to this i step outside to notice my lock has been chopped on my front porch and my bike which i cannot afford to replace has been stolen overnight. i spent the better half of my day walking around town checking local pawn shops and filing a police report. on top of this it had begun to rain heavily i was cold uncomfortable and miserable. after this i went home and tried to distract myself with video games but this just ended up making me feel even more lonely bored and useless. another few hours went by i thought the rain had passed so i went down to the beach where i normally go to clear my head only to be rained on some more. in a depressive state i said fuck it and on my way home i went into the local dispensary and bought some thc caps. i contemplated popping one right then and there on my walk home. but however i decided to wait until i get home and really think about if i wanted to break my 6 days of sobriety. i sat on my couch turned on netflix and was about to take one. just before i did i checked my phone to notice a text only minutes prior from my roommate and best friend back home. he knew i was trying to quit and informed me of this sub. its almost as if in this moment he felt my depressive state and reached out to me moments before i went too far without even knowing it. as soon as he mentioned it i looked at this sub read multiple stories of people struggling just like me and decided no i do not want to break my short lived sobriety. so for that i thank all of you for taking the time to tell us in this sub how you were feeling how youve overcome that urge to smoke and how awful youve felt when you break your sobriety. your story means more than you know keep with it and thank you for reading mine. and to my best friend my brother who reached out love ya man xx.,sadness
if you feel like shit and want to smoke just remember that afterwards youll still feel like shit except plus a headache and a brain fog and it wont make it any better. i started smoking to help me like chill out and not be consumed by my overactive mind. turns out that adding weed to that just adds additional problems and doesnt help anything. feeling like shit sober is better than feeling like shit high. like seriously. when you feel like shit sober there is the possibility of actually taking actions to change your scenario. once you feel loke shit high you def just gonna feel way worse and trapped and literally not good at all. just bear down and wait for your dopamine levels to stabilize. i dont think ive ever in my life literally ever have i ever gone i am glad i was high for that. so much bs propaganda out about weed pushed by junkies that arent honest with themselves and just want everyone to be miserable with them. this drug is shit fucking garbage. feel like shit sober. feel the pain. i hate weed so much now. youre addicted to the compulsion and your idealization of an expected effect that you literally wont get. im so disappointed in myself for falling for this shit for so long.,sadness
if you manage to stay sober for just 7 days you wo not believe how well you sleep the vivid dreams you have and how energized you feel in the morning. i used to feel awful in the mornings even after sleeping 7 or 8 hours. now i feel with a clear head and ready to take the day. its a myth that weed does not have a hangover effect like alcohol does. its not as strong or noticeable but once you go sober you really realise it.,sadness
has quarantine made it 10x harder to quit for any of you live in california there is 3 dispensaries within a 10 mile radius from my home. i have not been at work cause of quarantine and have not been able to gym or jiu jitsu either. i had a good 5 month sober run and felt amazing and relapsed on 420 and have been trying to quit every day since but it seems so hard cause i do not do anything during this quarantine and feel so helpless,fear
day 414 without weed. living a better life. hey guys ive been lurking for so long i ca not even tell anymore. decided to share my story and thank all of you for supporting me without even knowing. i m28 started smoking weed at 13 yo and have been smoking with several short pauses pretty much all my life until last january. there were times i smoked less several times a week to 0.5 gram daily and times i smoked heavily 2 3 grams a day but for most of the time i was smoking on a daily basis. weed never felt like it would destroy my life but rather always felt like a good old friend i could always rely on. that is what i consider its greatest danger. the sublety of weed making so many things so much more difficult. despite being diagnosed as a highly gifted kid at a young age and skipping first grade because i was able to read write and do most of elementary school level maths in kindergarten. i often struggled in school not because i could not follow the lessons but because i was often high in school or skipping school because of being high. in the end i still graduated my countrys equivalent of high school but had very bad grades and at some point almost got kicked out for being absent. at 18 i moved out of my parents house and started going to university about 500km away. living in a student dormitory i quickly started to bond with pretty much every other pothead and weed became an even bigger part of my life. when i went to the university it was almost exclusively for the few mandatory courses exams or at a later point to work as a tutor. for the most part i was just in that city to party and do drugs. i studied for 6 years and did not even get my bachelors degree even though i even wrote a bachelor thesis. as a result of years of taking nothing serious i got kicked out for screwing up my last try for an exam from the 2nd semester. in 2012 i lost my driving license due to driving while high and i never bothered to do a 1 year drugscreening with a psychological assessment of my driving capabilities until last year. after university i got a place in a 3 year apprenticeship with very low pay. my boss knew why i was not allowed to drive and he tolerated it for the course of the apprenticeship since the process of getting back my license costs a shitton of money i did not have but after that included me being able to drive as a necessity for the following employment contract. this was what finally gave me the incentive to get my shit together. i quit smoking cold turkey did the drug screening got my driving license and a car got a job with a decent starting salary and am looking forward to moving into a house with my girlfriend of 6 years living together for 35 years in a small appartment. for the first time in my life i feel like a worthy adult and not as a teenaged fuck up. i could have had all that happiness and security so much earlier if i was not stoned all the time. during all that process i often read the posts in leaves to remind me what it felt like when i relapsed the first couple times and had to start again. your encouragement of every single one of us struggling might not have been the reason i did not relapse but it was the reason it was easier to stay strong. thank you. sorry for the huge wall of text but i got carried away. to all of you still struggling in the beginning quitting weed might be hard but it gets easier. slowly at first but there will come a point at which it gets easier every day. soon you will hit the point at which you do not miss it anymore. stay strong.,joy
630 days clean. feels awesome,joy
i just hit my 1 month sober mark. i would not have mad it this far without this subs daily encouragement so thank you.,anger
50 reasons why im quitting weed mary jane weve had some amazing times but i think its time we end things. were no good for each other. ive been smoking weed for 3 years consistently and daily for about 2. throughout this time i have maintained a semblance of a normal life going to school working and making friends but ive become complacent. i happily wore the stoner title like a badge of honor proud of the fact that id somehow managed to achieve all i had while smoking as much as i did. it took me two years of missed deadlines broken friendships to realize how backwards that was. winners justly boast about the hurdles theyve overcome but not the ones theyve laid out for themselves. ive always made my decisions based on pros and cons of the options and when i started considering dropping weed i realized quickly much weed worked against me. weed burns holes in your lungs your clothes and your memory. ironically i would usually realize how little i enjoyed smoking weed when i was high and those thoughts would fade. but they unlike so many high thoughts were rational. so i wrote them down – i made a list. so that even with my clouded memory i could remember the reasons i need to stop. at the time of writing ive tried quitting 3 times. the first time i wasnt committed and lasted about 5 days. the second time i tried harder but got to day 10 before i faltered again. this is my third time and im holding myself to this. ive throw out my pipe. ive given away my grinder. ive shattered my bong and ive burnt through all my weed. i need someone to stay committed to. every day for the next 20 days i am going to return to this thread and write a comment. i might do more but i sure as hell wont do less. this isnt for attention this isnt even really for anyone to see. this is just me finding someone or something to be accountable to. because being accountable for myself isnt working. ill make my first comment tomorrow. ive also attached 50 reasons i need to quit in no particular order below. hopefully someone somewhere can get something out of this. 1. it makes you lethargic tired and lazy. 2. it gives you anxiety for a good reason. 3. it has ruined your short term and now long term memory. 4. it has made you complacent uninspired and stuck. 5. you dont follow your dreams anymore 6. probably because you dont have them 7. you never challenge yourself 8. you are not as creative as you were 9. you embarrass yourself in conversation 10. your sense of time is absolutely destroyed. 11. you are late to everything unprepared and forgetful. 12. you dont find new music. you listen to what is familiar. 13. your friends dont like what youre doing to yourself. 14. it makes you eat and gain weight. 15. it yellows your teeth you forget to brush and your breath smells like shit. 16. it makes you sluggish at work. they notice. 17. you dont reach out to new people 18. everyone can smell it on you and judges you for it. 19. it ruins your mornings. 20. you are boring to talk to when youre high. 21. you get anxiety when speaking. 22. your lungs hurt all the time. 23. you run out of breathe you cough and you spit. its disgusting. 24. even those who respect you the most hate that you do it to yourself. 25. your gpa is lower than it could and should be. 26. you spend recklessly when youre on it. you dont make time to budget 27. your workouts are so lazy they are useless. 28. you have a lazy stoner reputation no matter how hard you work. 29. you are risking your job every time you go to work high. 30. you are messy. 31. you procrastinate your problems until they get worse and worse and worse. 32. you compensate for the lethargy by abusing amphetamines. 33. you miss deadlines and forfeit opportunities. 34. your acne gets terrible. 35. you never follow through on your daily goals 36. it burns you destroys your gums your fingernails and your mouth. 37. movies books and music arent as fulfilling. 38. your emotions are null. 39. you stay up late and sleep in consistently. 40. your relapses destroy your mind your confidence and your happiness. 41. you put yourself and others at risk when you drive. 42. your father and mother are disappointed in you. 43. you are influencing those who look up to you in the worst way. 44. it introduced you to other drugs which are their own story. 45. you are unintentionally mean and uninterested to those you care about. 46. you are wasting your youth on something thats not real. 47. you are not the person you want to be. 48. you are not the person you wanted to be. 49. its only going to get worse if you dont stop. 50. you only have one chance at life. youre wasting it.,sadness
i had chinese food yesterday and my fortune cookie said keep up the good work. you will be rewarded. if thats not a sign i do not know what is. im on day 16 or so and have had some iffy moments lately due to boredom etc. but man that cookie. i laughed my ass off. keep going everyone we can do it,anger
today marks 1 year free from weed im going to keep it brief since that other dude has a huge post with some good advice in it. for me today marks 1 year since i last toked. i have one year free from weed and 100 something days from alcohol and all other drugs. weed was my drug of choice but unfortunately for someone like me i tend to get a little too excited about other substances in its absence so ive cut off everything. maybe in time that will change but for today ive never felt better being clean. i spent a decade smoking obsessively and all it really was in the end was a giant waste of time. i was a pretty hardcore smoker but i did it before those carts and stuff came on the market though my friends and i sure did dabs and stuff with a blow torch rig when we could get grams of oil. what ive learned during my time in sobriety is that drugs do not make me happy people make me happy. i am not as much of an isolator as i thought. connections with people make me happy. it is through those relationships that i find true happiness. i used to use 1 2oz a month and thought i could never quit. ive learned a lot of ways not to quit. what works for me is hanging out with other sober people. i love going to my weekly ma meeting though i also attend other 12 step fellowship. during those meetings i can see that im not alone. i can help other people and by doing that they help me. we do it together. i am honest. honest with myself first and then honest with others. honesty and fellowship. together we can do what i cannot do alone.,joy
things ive noticed after 19 days of being sober. im not depressed as much i eat healthier i feel healthier suddenly day seems to have more hours than before i sleep 7 hours a day instead of 10 i dont need to worry about money anymore i find joy in simple things like cooking or reading i cleaned my room first time in years yes years i went to see doctor stomach problems that i was afraid to go to for a year i bought 6months swimmingpool ticket watching youtubetv shows seems boring af now so im constantly looking for other things to do sweets dont taste so good actually i dont even think i like them anymore bag of chips plus bar of chocolate plus mountain dew was my regular supper before before i wouldnt answer my phone if not high lol now its not a problem i can look into other peoples eyes without sweating lol2 at work taxi i dont need to worry if my clients can smell weed anymore my brain is getting sharper i dont mumble anymore i can speak without yyyyyy after each sentence i still need to improve a lot but its getting better and i feel a little bit motivated before the only motivation to get out from bed would be to smoke. thanks for reading and good luck to every single one of you lukasz,joy
my girlfriend broke up with me because i am a piece of shit i am 18 years old and i have been smoking weed everyday since i was 15 years old. four years ago my family lost everything in a house fire and my dad didnt handle it well. he became a heavy drinker and it spiraled down quick. in february 2016 my father went into cardiac arrest. i quickly started smoking heavily as a terrible but easy coping mechanism. shortly after this my dog stella was hit by a car and killed. my mom wasnt handling this well either and she became a severe alcoholic as well. i wasnt any better than her though. the more and more i smoked the more and more i set off my problems to the next day. these problems rooted themselves in my brain manifested my soul and controlled my entire life. where i was once a joyful hopeful young man i turned into a cold miserable heartless soul. i was sad all the time suicidal would snap at family members over the smallest of disagreements want to fight my own friends sleep all day i had no quality of life. then comes along girlfriend. she was amazing. she put up with all my shitty habits my anger sleeping all day and she only wanted to help. she tried to get me to go to counseling get a doctors appointment and held me when i wanted to cry. everything she did revolved around making me happy. but i still wasnt. i still smoked everyday i put off every bit of advice she gave me. i snapped at her the same way that i snapped before at my mother my brother my friends. because thats what i do. she deserved nothing but love and respect and i gave her bullshit. she came over to my dorm yesterday and told me she just couldnt be with me anymore. she told me she loved me and we hugged and cried for hours. i couldnt be mad at her i knew i was terrible. now when its too late i just want to scream how sorry i am. i love that girl so much she was the only thing good in my life. i felt that getting high was the only thing numbing the pain. i am terrified of the all too familiar darkness that comes with sobering up. but i am ready for that. i have set an alarm for midnight for at midnight i will no longer be smoking weed. no more nicotine. no more sleeping until 2 p.m. and for gods sake no more fucking excuses. i cant feel this way anymore. i either have to pick myself up and fight this or it is going to kill me.,joy
day 4 after 24 years of heavy use here are the reasons i quit these are the reasons i wanted to quit that i listed in my journal while i was still smoking. remember my life. experience life and then have memory of those experiences better relationship w my husband he couldnt stand that i did it but really and truly he never knew the extent to which i smoked. ive been lying to him for years about it and it just made me feel like such a bad person. save several hundred dollars a month can plan a trip anywhere and not worry about how i would bring pot or get it there my health my cough my lungs no regrets when im on my death bed wo not get munchies and eat shitty food will be more articulate at work. my company deserves better. they treat me so amazingly and ive been high the whole time take control of my life and not the other way around no more risk of driving w it no more having to go to my drug dealer. nice guy but ugh i hated having to go actually feeling my emotions wrinkles. im 41 so smoking only makes you look older. period. all the hiding. i smoke everywhere i go. cant tell you how many places that ive snuck in my cart went to the bathroom and was getting high as a kite w no one the wiser the smell. i love the smell do not get me wrong but i hated how it stuck to me and could get me caught if the wrong person smelled it. better memory. i have 3 college degrees got all 3 being high as a kite ugh but i do not remember shit so when people talk about intellectual things i say yeah i think yada yada yada. because i do not freaking remember even though i know ive learned or experienced what they are talking about beginning of day 4 for me im actually feeling really good. bad night sweats and lots of boredom but ive been getting mentally prepared for the worst so im just taking it hour by hour. day by day. this sub is what has 100 helped me make this decision. and at this point it is exactly that a decision im making. one thing im so grateful for is that im making this decision and its not being forced on me by my job husband or the law i live in an illegal state. wr can do this,sadness

a week clean and something occurred to me hi everyone i havent smoked anything the past week and i feel neither happy or disappointed about it. it just is. what struck me more though is that ive been battling and trying to quit since about april. sometimes id go as much as a month without smoking and think to myself okay ive got it all under control then id light up and have to start all over again. i listened to podcasts on my drive to and from work. i was listening to one where a navy seal and green beret were talking and more specifically they were talking about community. the green beret said that after he left the army he went through a real hard track in his life as he didnt have a mission or real purpose. he said the army teaches that if you have even just one person a community of two you can cover 360 degrees. if youre by yourself though youre always leaving blind spots. it just clicked as soon as he said it. ive got friends and people i hang out with regularly. im not some loner but i dont know anyone that would really understand this or what im going through. in a way i still feel alone because people wouldnt be able to relate or really understand. then i realized that ive been doing this wrong and that if i want to better myself and stay on the path then i need to reach out to this community. to all of you wonderful people. none of us are alone. stay strong. thank you for reading. edit thanks for the silver,joy
255 days no weed it seems impossible until its done. that shit was addictive af for me 😑🤨,anger
its amazing how your personality changes after being sober a while. the mental adjustment to a new sober person and new lifestyle takes time. but in the long run its a good thing.,joy
5 months after quitting smoking i made a collage for my art class trying to resemble my struggle to let go of the high. my reality was bleak while my head was losing grasp of reality. quitting was one of the best decisions of my life,sadness
i made it to day 5 and i have no idea how after the train wreck that was thanksgiving my family was smokin weed left and right a lot of arguing which escalated into straight up fighting. someone stole my sisters weed there were like 4 separate occasions where we all thought a fist fight was about to break out. everyone cried at some point in the night. my cousin kicked my aunt out of the car on the side of the road and she had to walk to a stranger‘s house to call us. the list honestly could go on. i have no idea how i made it through that without getting high as fuck. but i made it. hello day 5. edit thanks for the award🥺🥺💞💞,anger
how crazy is it that everything that makes you you your feelings and emotions which affect your personality goal aspirations relationships etc are all controlled by a handful of chemicals in the brain dopamine serotonin etc. the thing that gives you motivation to eat better yourself sex form relationships etc is all built into your reward system. and yet here i was just fucking frying the shit out of myself. i was literally robbing myself of my motivation for life and my sense of self. something as important like your brain shouldnt be mucked around with so casually. and yet there i was heres to day 4.,joy
day 1. can i get an amen this is it. no more. basta. from prada to nada. not smoking today and rest of 2020. help,joy
quit cannabis in 2006 best decision of my life when i smoked that joint with a friend back in the summer of 2006 i had no idea it would be my last. i do not want to stress myself out by saying ill never use cannabis again in my life but i have zero desire to go back to it. i think the 20 years of smoking weed were a form of self medicating for the see saw of depression and anxiety. little did i know the weed was merely covering up the symptoms and was keeping me feeling mellow and complacent so i never felt the inner push to look at the root causes. things that have helped me stay off the bong eating decently im no health nut but i shy away from fast food and junk food whenever possible getting outdoors walks hikes runs getting out into water or floating on top of it meditation a quick 10 minutes with a guided meditation app i recommend waking up 10 happier headspace or calm all good each has strengths and shortcomings exercise weights yoga tai chi hiit relationships really showing up for people clear headed and attentive with heart the people in my life are what keep me sane and bring me joy whether today is your last day of smoking or its the first day youve ever considered taking a break from smoking i wish you well. 🤘☀️🙏,joy
wondering how many people have quit for a while then thought they could try it again as a one off and went back to smoking it regularly so i stopped for around 3 months last year and i decided to have a stoner weekend thinking ill just have some and finish it on the sunday and be in control then go back to normal. oh how i was wrong i ended up smoking every day again up until 5 days ago. i genuinely feel like it doesnt matter how long i stay clean i can never try it again as a one off or anything like that. anyone else had this happen or similar how did you feel knowing you can probs never do it again even as a one off or anything like that,joy
3 months off weed and cigarettes anxiety mild depression kicks in still. university professor at my early 50s quitting weed and cigarettes after 30 years. approaching 3 months off both no relapse. the good things mental clarity energy and strength waking up easily in the mornings lungs throat breathing much better already no weight gain no bipolar behavior from lying in bed till afternoon and feeling hopeless to working like crazy and feeling like a semi god no severe cravings after month 2. the bad things a periodic anxiety comes every week two weeks stays for some days leaves triggered by anxious dreams starting in the morning. if it stays more than a couple of days triggers a mild depression. makes me not wanting to work avoiding decisions feeling overwhelmed. but it goes away when i just stay in bed relaxing the period helps. procrastination. was there with the weed too but now i do not have the weapon of getting high to battle. result less work drive lower self esteem. anhedonia less sex drive less drive for playing music or hanging out with friends the last two i avoid as they were weed connected. a feeling of boredom of missing the high. the aids exercise 2 3 hours a week plus 3 km a day walking away the dog. meditation daily 10 20 minutes headspace reading non fiction literature reddit 1 3 hours per day eating with caution drinking with caution traveling when not too down. supportive spouse therapy monthly a couple of very close friends ex weed users too telling people about it to close ones about quitting weed to the rest about quitting smoking creates some space justifies a leave me alone i sufferattitude . no meds no nicotine no cannabis. despite the struggles i feel determined. any suggestion welcome,sadness
re boredom to those who have asked about coping with boredom im five months into sobriety and there are not enough hours in the day for me to get all the things done. i have more interests and energy than i can remember. trust the process there will eventually be a switch and all of a sudden youll find yourself busy and energetic. it may take a while but it happens.,joy
anyone else quit smoking because of mental health i was using carts almost every day for months which isnt good because a lot of the carts were really strong. my mental health slowly got worse as i started getting more depressed and anxious. i didnt even enjoy smoking after a few months but i did because i couldnt sleep without it.,sadness
4 years without and just popping in i smoked everyday from 14 to about 28. needed it to sleep needed it to be normal essentially needed it to function in what i thought was everyday life. when i first quit i used this and other forums for support so though i would come in now. if i was trying to quit during this time where for a lot of people you are being given time off work then i would have made up alot of excuses to pick up. weed made up my life for years and it took a lot of effort to pack it in. when i first quit i could not imagine life with out it and thought about it every minute this is the first time ive thought about it in years. ive gone from some one who needed it to function to having a fleeting thought about it because ive been on full pay for 2 months and no work to do and old stoner buddies in the same position reconnecting with me. it does not matter how much you think its part of you and part of your life you can leave it behind you too.,sadness
so proud of all the 20 something year olds who have decided quit. in todays society and the changing laws and peer pressure. its gotta be pretty difficult to want to maintain a clean and sober lifestyle. it takes a hell of a lot of willpower and determination to want to change a lifestyle that can be a bunch of fun when youre young. in my 20s friends called me smoky. i lit up every chance i could. looking back i wish i had the smarts like you guys. i wish someone had told me i was abusing it. no matter how youre feeling after quitting. just know you are accomplishing something great and beneficial to your life. keep plowing forward and congrats.,joy
just threw my pen in a dumpster across town the only way i use is pens and i just tossed mine all the way across town in an actual nasty dumpster. i ca not buy another one because i dont have a medical card anymore. wish me luck.,anger
i am the best me without weed i am satisfied with mediocrity when i am high. i am less social when i am high. i am less productive when i am high. i am less motivated when i am high. my emotions are suppressed when i am high. i am unfulfilled when i am high. i am more anxious and i have extreme mood fluctuations when i am sober. i have realised that weed has been a coping mechanisms for my anxieties for a long time. i have been smoking everyday for 3 years. if i do not tackle my issues with a sober mind things will never get better and i will never regain all my positive traits that weed suppresses. i am the best me without weed. when i think of my life with this perspective it makes quitting feel obtainable.,joy
i smoked for 17 years daily multiple times a day. 8 days of no marijuana. hey i am so glad i found this reddit. i have been reading through all of your posts and ca not help but smile and tear up a bit because its exactly what i feel is needed for anyone considering or actively quitting to smoke pot. like the title says i smoked daily multiple times a day for 17 years. i am now on day 8 of 100 no intake of weed. that first night you know i was looking for rug nugs on the ground in the cushions wherever i thought id find a little puff. luckily for me it was a failed search. i say lucky now but at the time i was pissed after a week i can safely say my dreams are insanely vivid. i have been able to dream in color remember my dreams the detail is better than i can actually remember my dreams ever being. the hard part is getting to sleep and eating but when i get into bed i actually smile thinking this dream is probably going to blow my mind the hardest part for me is i do not have much going on in my life at the moment so my daily habits are very similar to what they were before. i chill at my computer and instead of playing games most of the time i end up watching documentaries and actually remembering more than snippets reading up on stuff thats interested me such as sailing and going to the library to find more information on sailing. ive never sailed before in my life and the ocean terrifies me but i want to do it some day day 1 5 the most frustrated ive been mentally in a long time. i have been rude to my family and snapped over menial things. i explained to them why i am snapping but that does not justify me being a jerk. i will have to apologize again and again hoping for their forgiveness over time. the physical difference ive noticed during those first five days would be my brain is functioning differently. things that interested me before when i was high are boring as hell. i loved gaming but during those days i would get on a game and stare the screen maybe join in and be bored after 4 minutes. it was not the same without weed. i was thinking how the hell can people play games sober all the time insanity i explained to my close friends from online communities 10 years of friendship that i needed to change myself to improve who i was in life. i feel so unsuccessful spending as much money as i did on pot instead of saving it. i think money is a really smart thing to think about when you consider smoking. even if you do not spend a lot write down how much you would be spending and add it up. its kind of gross how much i personally was spending on weed and not saving for my future self. that sum really wakes me up and gives me hope. day 5 7 i still was frustrated but some things were really becoming enjoyable again. being around other people was one of the best things i could have done especially if they know what you are trying to do. i say that because some of my friends still smoke so i explained to them to refrain from mentioning it telling me about it just anything that would make me think about it. obviously i knew they were smoking but the not talking about it like we normally would is a good change for the person trying to quit. it sounds cliche but it really is very important to share the information to the people you surround yourself with because they will help you if they are your friends i have received nothing but support from these people so i suggest being open with your close friends as well. these were the days i just thought smoking would be so nice right now but i have never been this distanced from smoking before i started years ago. day 8 i am willingly writing about whats going on for me because guess what it helps talk to people about what youre going through and explain the frustrations. they will listen and maybe even give you some advice or suggestions to stay busy. thats key staying busy i am fortunate to have an amazing dog that loves to go on walks more than me and that might be the best thing to break a sweat and change the scenery. my advice for the annoying feelings that come with refraining from smoking hot showers. if possible crank it to as hot as you physically can tolerate. the smell of soap and shampoo mixed with the steam just feels amazing and calming. if you are extremely frustrated or anxious get in a hot shower maybe go for a walk before hand to combine exercise and the steam for an even more effective treatment. i do not know what this post will do other than help me get my thoughts out to others who may be in a similar situation. i promise you during the first few days i was incapable of writing up this much and not wanting to smash my screen out of boredom. i still feel slightly bored but i realize each day i go without smoking is another day closer to clarity. those dreams though they are a phenomenal experience and i really think even if you are not going to stop smoking distance smoking and sleeping to experience it yourself. heres olive who has helped me immensely by keeping me busy instead of buying pot go adopt a dog still less expensive than smoking daily,sadness
been basically clean since quarantine started and im feeling like a new person ive been basically clean since quarantine started. ive decided to stop counting the day because whenever i slip up i get so discouraged that it make me not want to start up again. ive discovered that even if i slip up and take an edible or hit a wax pen that doesnt mean i need to throw away all my progress a single mishap doesnt mean i should just go back to daily smoking like i was. none of us are perfect and sobriety isnt a perfect process either i dont use this as an excuse to smoke whenever i want but it does give me the ability to forgive myself for not being perfect and continue to make an effort to live a sober life away from weed.,joy
so i told my dr i quit smoking weed heres what he told me first he congratulated me and told me he was proud of me he asked has it been hard so far day 23 oddly no i told him my husband still smokes my friends have passed around a joint at the dinner table it doesnt even tempt me in fact it smells gross now keep in mind ive been a pretty dedicated stoner for 40 years im just over it. he told me ‘you will get the urge again sooner or later and it wont even be under stressful circumstances it will just pop out of nowhere and when that happens because it will find something else to do. so ok that. i mentioned that my sleep patterns are messed up and my weird dreams were well weird and unpleasant to say the least he explained that my brain is trying to rewire itself from years of having to work alongside of chemicals to be patient it will figure it out no comments on decoding the dreams they are just your brain working things out could be something you saw ate heard its just our subconscious processing and if youve been suppressing things as long as i have via weed its possible that its going back along way it will pass. he mentioned that because ive been self medicating all these years its possible that i could find that i have issues that i didnt realize ie depression or anxiety to name a couple of many and that if thats the case then seek help from a professional to manage it responsibly. if anyone is suffering from depression or other mental illness i recommend checking out ‘the bloggess aka jenny lawson she owns her mental illnesses so hard and she is funny as hell and you will find a tribe that lets you know youre not alone ok back to the docs input to date there is no irrefutable evidence that smoking pot permanently damages your brain the way alcohol does with time and patience your brain should be functioning just fine he said in my case at least 3 6 months which i find amazing and encouraging. its a good idea to start challenging your brain not with stupid word games he said but with something that interests you reading literature learn a language exercise your brain your memory will return. again he mentioned be patient and stay strong. he took x rays of my lungs because i never feel like i get a good satisfying deep breath there is nothing conclusive they are a little bit enlarged which could indicate copd but we agreed that i would try and exercise a little harder than i have been so i really force myself to breathe heavily and see if in a few months they dont feel better. if not we can do more tests. so for all yall out there freaking out that you fried your brains or worse i hear you but take heart its all reversible but you need to stay strong stay disciplined stay focused on the rest of your life good night and good luck also yall are amazing i look at the posts and positive kind people that respond to those who reach out and i realize we come from all over the world we are a tribe of good people who have so much empathy and theres so many of us from all walks of life with a common goal that unites us we want to be better we want to do better and it gives me hope that the world isnt completely filled with assholes. so thanks for that everyone love and light to you all 💋,joy
currently at the gym at 130 am. day 2 have been smoking for the past 6 years almost daily and even worse once my mom died in 2017. cant sleep and the cravings are bad so i forced myself to go to gym. idk why im making this post i guess i just wanted to tell someone who might care.,sadness
i cant believe cravings do actually pass for real i had been having these strong urges for the past three days due to my depression taking a toll on me again but i managed to not cave in somehow. im gonna be honest i dialed my dealers twice but they somehow did not respond so theres that. today at the library i felt like this abstinence thing is pointless and decided to get home to call my dealers once again. as soon as i got home i fell asleep and when i woke up i did not feel any urges at all. i deleted those dealers numbers and i did laundry and im going out for a dinner with a friend in about an hour. in conclusion if youre having cravings try to just safely relax. i know its not easy but trust me itll pass. it will surely pass. anyway just wanted share my story to keep you guys encouraged and motivated. im on day 14 and i will not break the chain no matter what. peace love you all,joy
3 months congratulate me please plus the good the bad i hit 3 months a couple days ago and i wanted to make a post about my experience. this sub has been huge for me. this is the longest ive gone without weed by far in 5 years. the first month was hard the second month was much easier and the third month was kinda hard again so im really proud that i have not relapsed. the good bags under my eyes have disappeared it took like 2 months but wow its really true its crazy to think i did not get a good nights sleep with rem for 5 years. joy creativity hunger sleepiness these things come up naturally now rather than needing to be smoke induced every time. at first weed amplifies these things but with regular use it becomes the only way to experience them. im taking care of my teeth regularly. i watched the new rick morty episodes without getting high i do not think ive ever watched the show sober before but it was still really funny and i think it was easier to follow the story. its freeing to not feel like i have to be high before i can watch a tv show or play a game. short term memory is improved. re connected with friendsfamily members who do not smoke weed. its easier to have spontaneous conversations and i feel like people are generally reacting to me better. taking more walks during the day in pretty public parks enjoying the sun and people walking their dogs rather than only at night to smoke in private. i feel more like myself like who i was when i was youngbefore weed. the bad so for the reason you already know this month ive been really depressed and struggling with daily functions. i had a week where i slept for 16 hours every day. i started to think if im just sleeping and eating anyway why do not i smoke i made a post here about it and got some good support. then hitting 3 months was kind of triggering i felt like have not i proved enough is not once every 3 months ok i started thinking about weed a lot again talking myself into relapsing and then talking myself out of it. thats the part of im sick of thinking about weed all the time and letting it control my daily schedule. i finally realized two things one what i remember about weed the good times is not what ill experience if im smoke again ill just be anxious and tired. two if i smoke once ill be thinking about weed every day for like another month and i really do not want that. so i think ive accepted that 3 months is not an excuse to relapse. the urges are diminishing for now at least. ok thats it. thank you for reading. you can do this and its so worth it,joy
one of the best things about weed also one of the worst things about quitting. daily smoker nearly 5 years. have had a few failed attempts at stopping longest being 6 weeks. im trying again and up to 5 days god i wish that did not feel like such a monumental success. weed and smoking always allowed me to shrink my world. to ignore external pressures obligations and irritations. my world went no further than me and my drug. this made it easily controllable and very comfortable. as proven by the existence of this sub weed is not a panacea but it feels that way when you are so deeply enthralled by it. the easy confrontationaless world i lived in was bliss and i never needed to face any difficult reality while i was there. trouble is when you quit that world quickly begins to fade like the façade it is and illuminates all the corners of life i had shut myself away from so willingly. that shrunken world i saw for years as my haven is actually my prison and it is killing me knowing how long i have inflicted that on myself.,surprise
quitting weed has given me my mornings back and its sacred but even if youre not a morning person it applies because leaving gives you your time back. i myself have always been a morning person and waking up to do my routines to settle into the world is so important. this morning i woke a little after six journaled and went on a bike ride to the beach got some groceries and made breakfast all before work. this never would have happened in smoking days i was perpetually groggy unmotivated sluggish and no matter how much i slept i woke up tired. good morning. ps for those who are curious im at the three week mark on one of many attempts. for the first week i let myself sleep as much as possible it seemed important to recuperating my energy.,joy

quitting isnt about giving something up its about taking back the things you deserve you deserve to not suffer from anxiety you deserve to feel true happiness you deserve to have meaningful relationships you deserve to socialize with people you deserve to have a clear mind you deserve to spend your money more wisely you deserve to not feel numb you deserve to enjoy the little things you deserve to make yourself your family and your friends proud dont let thc take all of these things away for temporary pleasure its not worth it. lets do this together brothers and sisters,sadness
dont fall for youre brain telling you life is boring and theres nothing to do without weed. its youre brain tricking you. after awhile without weed you gain real hobbys and start to truly find yourself and live the life you love if you know you can have it and strive towards it. for many of us here weed creates a problem that it also fixes and that becomes vicious cycle. replace that bad habit with good ones like exercise and meditation.if anyone needs any advice feel free to pm me or comment here. have a good day everyone,joy
enjoy life how weed taught you too. when you go to college you gain knowledge but you eventually graduate and leave. same with weed it taught you how to slow down and appreciate the here and now and enjoy the little things but now its setting you free to enjoy those things without the training wheels. just because you stopped getting stoned does not mean you ca not go through life with a stoned mindset.,anger
its been a long sweaty week but im still going. couldnt have done it without this sub i know that. thank you,anger
cancer i hate you hello all i recently popped my reddit cherry on this sub when i shared my story about being 7 years grounded. this week i found out my mother has stage iv ovarian cancer. i want nothing more than to show up to my neighbors house 98 sure hes a dealer and cop some flower. i want it so bad. i want to forget how i feel and abandon the reality that is my new normal. my mother is my rock my strength my guide out of the hell i was in so many years ago. i know this isnt a christian group or religious for that matter but i have nothing left other than my faith. i ask you guys to keep my family in your prayers. thanks for listening leaves,joy
for the lurkers the dreamers the smokers the leavers ive been lurking this subreddit on and off for several months and id like to share my thoughts with you. let me tell you my story in a relatable and perhaps meaningful way. at first i began smoking weed very rarely during social parties. i enjoyed it. it was euphoric. it was new. i entered a new perspective on myself whereby i felt i was carrying an internal conversation that helped discover new things about myself. then i started smoking more frequently. now the experience was still very enjoyable but i was beginning to not enjoy experiences without it. however i still continued to be a productive relatively successful individual respected occupation fancy apartment etc then i started the vape pens. those euphoric highs were extraordinary. i felt i was solving all the worlds problems in my head and then some. then those close to me suspected i was on something because my personality had changed. although i felt it hadnt they remarked that i was less connected and more dull. i had lost an edge that defined me. so i quit. several times. first a couple of days. then a week. then a couple of days. and so on. its now been 30 days. ill tell you whats happened. ive got my edge back. im sharper. more focused. im no longer escaping boredom anxiety or stress. im tackling them head on. im working out losing weight and studying again. its no coincidence. most importantly its not the streak of days that im no longer high that matters but the streak of days that i am consistently myself. i post this because this story will be true for almost all of you. i wish you the best. be your best. you owe it to you. the high is a lie.,joy
today i am 6 years free from cannabis addiction ama six years ago i could not imagine going a day without smoking. when my psychiatrist asked me to take a break for a week i did not make it more than two hours. i could not have imagined the life im living now which i know i could not have built if i was still smoking. edit since im getting a lot of man in the comments i just want to add that i am in fact a woman. no offence taken just wanted to make note of it in case there are other women that might identify with my experience. last year i posted for my 5 year anniversary and decided to make it an annual tradition. there are not a lot of people who understand the nature of this addiction so sharing it with this community feels like an appropraite was to celebrate the milestole. you can also read i bit about my early story in my six month ama in the thread last year i noticed someone had asked for a timeline so i thought id start with that and then see what questions you all have. 2013 one day admitted to psychiatric hospital for suicidal ideation one week released from hospital one month living with my parents attending lots of aa ma and na meetings going to therapy. still having suicidal thoughts but easier to manage three months able to drive myself places and volunteer regularly six months got a full time job in my field. 2014 one year got a cat celebrated anniversary with aa and ma groups. moved out shortly after to a large city where i lived by myself. got an internship in my field and worked as a nanny. directed a short play in a festival. started dating. 2015 two years stopped attending 12 step meetings and began drinking in moderation. moved in with roommates. directed a short play in a festival. around this time is when i basically stopped thinking about weed. 2016 three years directed a short play in a festival. entered a new field and got a new full time job stopped working as a nanny. started dating my spouse 2017 four years moved in with my partner got engaged. got promoted. 2018 five years got married. got a different job in a related field. 2019 six years moved with my spouse and our best friend to a new state where we are starting a small business. alwaysstill going to therapy at least 2x per month on psychiatric medications to treat anxiety and depression but they actually work now,joy
smoking again wo not bring you any knowledge you do not already have. youve smoked enough the spiritual effect phase of weed use is short and after that youve got to use your own intuition. hard and scary but real.,joy
everyone always told me this shit was not addictive. this is just ranting im sorry before i go on ill just say that out of the four years i have been smoking consistently 3 has been mixed with tobacco or spin as its called in australia. my mood is entirely dependent if i have bud it could be the worst of the worst bud and i would still find comfort in the fact i have something to chop up. i can not imagine a life without smoking bongs. i hate myself for not just being able to drop this substance. i have developed permanent hand tremors from the abuse and if i go two days i skitz out with anger at small things and my anxiety is at an all time high. but funny thing is the moment i smoke my anxiety also goes through the roof i can leave my house whatsoever out of fear of something terrible happening. i want to quit it so i dont fear the world anymore but everything terrifies me when im off it. what a fucking situation ive gotten myself into.,anger
2 months in and those innocent joint thoughts emerge aah long week in the office what an increidible feeling it would be to smoke a j on a weekend night and relax watch a show with the girl get some yummy food hang with the pets game on my pcwhat harm could that possibly be a lot i just have to type it out here to remind myself. that one friday night j would turn into picking up tomorrow for saturday teling myself i wont smoke sunday to get ready for work but i surely will and if i dont smoke i would be wishing for it all day and not enjoy my day off it would lead to me wanted to sneak a little tobacco in that j to make a nice spliff one of my brains favorite chemicals. i would start eating worse letting go of hobbies just to sit around and be high everyday chores would be way more obnoxious because im not stoned my relationship with my gf would struggle because someone so amazing should never take a backseat to weed well that makes me feel glad that i quit for all those reasons i need to keep these reasons in mind. cheers to wherever yall are on your path,joy
1 month sober after derealisation psychosis so ive been slowly recovering after a scary episode of derealisation and psychosis where i believed the tv was visually narrating my life and that i was the chosen one etc .at that point i made the choice to never smoke weed again or not for a long while at least and started focusing on both my physical health and mental. anyways today a girl who ive been hooking up with for a while wanted to share her first high with me and i declined i wanted to say yes so fucking bad. i couldnt explain to her why for some reason and i hate myself for it but it took a lot of self control for me to turn her down this is all stupid and unimportant but im just so proud of my self for finally showing some discipline for once in my life edit wow i didnt expect this much support thank you to whoever repliedyouve given me even more of a reason to make this a permanent change,joy
just hit 3 months clean this quote someone posted really stuck with me its like when someones using a vacuum cleaner for a long time while you try to watch tv. you ignore it long enough and eventually you do not really notice. until it finally stops. i can assure you this is true and a love my new life without weed,joy
tomorrow never came for me so i quit today. quitting for so many positive reasons i could write a book. will i miss this plant yes. is this plant part of my future life no. over and out yall. will be back and forth with the withdrawals as there is gonna be a few btw u.k. based so quitting tobacco and weed at same time. didnt make any sense to me to spilt an addiction where the action is the same. hope everyone made progress today feel good about yourself,joy
has anyones depression gotten better after leaving weed i am very curious. ive smoked for 5 years now and ive been having severe depression for 3 years now. not sure if its the weed or just me.,surprise
8 months sober heres what ive learned this is a long post so im going to use bolding and tldrs for the long sections to help make it more digestible. the sections are intro what ive gained what ive lost how i did it and tldr. intro i smoked daily for 8 years and struggled trying to quit from november 2016 to january 2019. it took me nearly 3 years to get 8 months sober. i swear if i can do it you can do it too. this community was soooo valuable in helping me quit so i wanted to finally come back and share my experience. i hope you find it helpful. what ive gained mental clarity confidence self love interacting with people is so much easier im happier and more connected to the good parts of my life better relationships with my family and friends i have more time less stress less sensitiveeasily hurt more empathy stable moods the ability to face my negative emotions and hear what they need to tell me the ability to face my positive emotions and truly experience them i can identify other problems in my life that need addressing sustained focus on developing myself instead of trying things and not sticking with them better self control better sleep more desire to socialize less craving to self isolate tldr life is so much better and easier. not always easy and not always great but 8 months in everything in my life has and continues to improve. what ive lost lets be honest we would not be here if we did not love weed. were the ones who love it too much. we love it so much we have to take it away from ourselves. so yeah giving it up theres going to be some loss. for years i struggled with the idea of quitting forever. weve all experienced the fun and i believe genuinely beneficial aspects of getting stoned. my hang up in quittingwhat i thought id really miss introspection and self revelation awe inspiring experiences with music movies and video games helping me get excited about my life do i really have to quit forever where am i at now introspection and self revelation all that good stuff that bubbles up usually only in like the first half hour when youre high is actually bubbling up all the time. smoking weed can send a lot of it up at once and it makes you more interested because your thoughts feel more profound but youll still have these realizations and insights into your life while sober and your ability to integrate them increases greatly. i still miss this a bit but nbd. music video games movies i love that feeling of wonder when youre singularly immersed in something. some of my experiences with weed and music movies and video games were truly transcendent. but far far more of my experiences were desperately grasping for the feeling of wonder not finding it and ending up sorely disappointed. that feeling of wonder comes from presence. being fully present and fully experiencing something. the good parts of being high did that to me. gave me singular focus plus a blast of feel good chemicals. so where is the wonder is it in weed no its within you. i find that singular focus and wonder in so many more things now. music movies and video games still for sure but also in much quieter moments just taking in my surroundings. the wonder is within us and without us not in a bowl and a tv screen. weed could help force that feeling. it could also make you grasp desperately at it for hours on end. let it come to you. getting excited about my life this is the one thats still hanging around. weed has the ability mostly before you totally abuse it to take a random tuesday night and make it feel exciting and special. to make me want to get on my computer and make a song or excited to eat dinner excited about whatever. i do find that excitement naturally but honestly i do still miss being able to bottle that excitement and crack it open when im feeling sort of an ennui. that bottle came with a price though which is feeling wholly unmotivated and like you just ca not even and i do try to appreciate not paying that price. i tend to trust that my excitement for life will continue to improve over time. quitting forever i do not think about it as much. sure its possible i could have a healthy relationship with weed some day. i think like any drug theres a type of usage where it can enhance your life at minimal cost. i abused alcohol in my late teen years and for many years now ive had no problem enhancing my life with a drink or two with friends like once a month without paying the cost of a hangover or full loss of faculties. its possible i could get there with weed. but i do not worry about it as much these days. i have not lost as much as ive thought i would and ive gained so much. i want to protect that. tldr the things youll miss about weed are an inherent part of life. you come by all that good stuff far more often living clean and sober its just distributed more evenly throughout your life instead of concentrated into that perfect smoke sesh weve all been chasing. how i did it ill give a full list of things that helped and then focus specifically on the things that were different this time that i actually quit after years of struggling meditation therapy exercise healthy diet reading rleaves keep trying i did these things for years and never made it past 2 months. so what changed well a few things make an emergency plan by far the most important thing here. whats the difference between re lapse and 8 months sober surviving a few of the strongest urges ive ever had to smoke. in 243 days sober probably 230 of them were easy as pie maybe 10 required some conviction and 3 were borderline miraculous i did not smoke. i got so close to smoking those 3 days. what saved me knowing id face insanely strong urges making a plan for when that happened and following my plan. whenever i got to the point where i was about to give up and smoke i got on rleaves and read. i read and read still thinking i was going to smoke but instead of smoking i read. eventually id stumble onto something that gave me the strength not to smoke and i knew id made it past that craving. this is what got me to 8 months sober. that was my plan. make your own. re commit to being sober every day and give a reason its important i started out hand writing my commitment in a notebook every morning and i did that for a month or two. eventually i found the i am sober app and started doing it there too and eventually started doing just the app. i still do the app. renew your commitment every day. keep it strong. talk about it with your friends my weed usage was such a shameful thing for me and i kept it hidden for so long. share your struggles with people theres so much connection to be found in our shared struggles. people say the opposite of addiction is connection and that feels true to me. connect with others on this topic connect with others in general and do not be afraid to show this side of yourself. just tread lightly at first some people wo not be ready to talk about it if they are not ready to look at some related part of themselves. call it what it is this has always been hard for me but here it goes. im addicted to weed. my dad is an alcoholic his dad was an alcoholic my moms dad was an alcoholic and im addicted to weed. i had to realize it was not one bowl or one evening with nothing going on it was addiction. one random night is no big deal but addiction is a huge deal and i had to re frame and face up to it to deal with it. mantras any time i saw craving thoughts thank you meditation for helping me see these i would repeat a mantra for myself in response. i had a few but one was i am an alcoholic as was my father as was his father before him. it helped stop or slow that runaway train that starts with one random thought and leads to picking up pizza after work and getting super duper stoned. tldr life is great sober. everything you love about getting high is still here but better and easier. if youre struggling stay strong love yourself and keep on struggling. make yourself a plan to beat this thing. youre worth it and the struggle is worth it. read rleaves. it helps. much love,joy
365 days clean i wish i could deliver some feel good story like i have seen on here so many times. i wish i could say quitting did exactly what i thought and helped me turn my life around. i cannot. i started this during my thanksgiving break of 2019. i was away from my weed for a few days and i got on a streak. it was rough. ill spare the details you have all heard before. but eventually i got to enjoy the vivid dreams and the other benefits that came from quitting. i had started to dig only to find out that i had a lot more dirt to dig through. i was always smoking to avoid my real problems and avoid the pain. quitting did not fix me. i have so much work to do. im still young. but i did it. i quit. in the grand scheme of things it really didnt do much. i didnt change my life. i still dont like a lot of things about me. i still cant take care of myself. but i took the first step. i was always motivated by all the life changing stories i read on here. i thought i would do the same. but i have barely even started. i cant be the only one like this. quitting may be the one thing holding some of you back. but i know there has to be somebody else like me who has more shit to uncover. this is where you start. you quit smoking. i have quit and i have finally started to fix everything else.,joy
this is really unpleasant. i know im just yelling into the ether but damn does this suck. about a couple weeks abstaining after years of daily use. the insomnia the dreams and the emotional beating anxiety and depression are really bad. when i can sleep i wake up in the morning feeling like i have not slept at all. its like this constant mental and emotional beating. i have no desire to use to be honest i do not even miss it but i just want to feel normal again already. ugh. thanks for reading just typing this makes me feel better. edit to update thank you all. really. everything you have all said has been incredibly helpful and just knowing that there are a bunch of people ive never met who give enough of a damn to comment and help a random stranger really helps the commonality and shared experience especially. i was afraid as a mid 40s dude having a rough time with this that id be an outlier. im glad im not. just knowing its going to clear up eventually makes it easier to suck up how it feels now. im still exercising going to hit it even harder talking to a shrink and im going to try a little melatonin at night. again thank you all for the kind thoughts advice and inspiration.,joy
been clean for a month even tho where i live weed is legal there are two dealers in my apartment a dispensary in front of me and my friends smoke its been so difficult and i never thought i would do it for the reasons i wrote but i quit cold turkey and i am a month clean used to be a cig smoker a few years ago and when i quit cigs it started to disgust the f out of me. never smoked or touched a cig since then. and it started to happen the same with weed so happy,joy
6 months. im speechless i never thought i would see the day where i could say i have not smoked weed in 6 months but here we are. ive turned down weed thats been offered to me ive been around people getting high i even made brownies with my aunt mainly because i love baking and told her to keep them. heres to another 6 months and into the rest of my life without anything holding me back. to everyone still struggling its okay. its a long hard road to recovery but we can make it through this together. i say it on all my posts here but thank you all for your support through my battle. if it was not for this sub and all of the kind hearted people in it i no doubt would not have ever made it this far.,joy
a year sober and ive saved 17000. yes thats how much i was spending on weed in a year. and that doesnt include the ubers i took because i felt too lazy to take the subway. that also doesnt include the pricey delivery food i ordered because i was too high to cook sometimes id pass out before itd come and i wouldnt even get the chance to eat it. i smoked for over ten years. thats six figures. up in smoke. just another reason of many to be sober. edit the number is not the point. i was dumb and reckless and i wouldnt wish that on anyone. my life was not sustainable and i was headed nowhere fast. thats the point.,sadness

reminder if you have some its all i think about when i have weed i just want to smoke it. if i wake up in the morning it will niggle at me until i have it. if i do not smoke it before work i rush through my whole day trying to get to it. if i do smoke before work ill need to smoke during work to maintain the high. if i have it at the weekends i just worry about running out. if i have lots and lots stashed away i worry that i have a problem or may be getting more paranoid often true. if i throw it away i then wonder why ive done it. if i pick up more i often wonder why ive done it. if i savour it its torture. if i chain smoke it its overwhelming. there is no enjoyable amount or preferred time of smoking for me. its just an endless game that cannot be won. its nice not having that extra baggage on my consciousness.,joy
i have this image in my head of what getting high will feel like. i really want it but i know its total bull. quitting is a mourning process. when i think about getting high i feel the exact same memory. everything slows down everything is so bright my vision fishbowls back a little i feel like my chest is rising a bit and i ca not help but giggle. this is what getting high used to feel like for me and it was very nice. everytime ive slipped up its been this tempting image that has caused it. everytime ive slipped up that has not been what happened. not for a long time. whenever i get high now i feel shivery anxious dried out tired. panic attack and isolation. huge regret. dopamine is the neurotransmitter that correlates with our expectation of something good. because weed is pretty much universally amazing when people start out dopamine is naturally released when a smoker thinks about getting high. even as the high starts to fade and suck everytime the dopamine level is still high making you expect that this time it will be fine. i believe quitting smoking is a mourning process. someone who has never been drug dependentaddicted would find that silly. but the truth is addiction is connection to a substance to make up for a lack of real connection with others and the real world. many of the same brain chemicals that make you love a person and make you grieve when they are gone are activated when you take a toke. losing weed can be like losing a friend or a partner as is evidenced by the way so many people personify marijuana when they say goodbye. whats tragic about addiction is that sometimes it can be even more confusing to accept than when your friend has died. if someone you love dies thats very hard but you also know that you ca not change what has happened. when quitting smoking you could theoretically bring mary j back to life by relapsing. and then you have to watch her die again when you inevitably choose to quit once again. rinse and repeat. the good news about all this quitting will almost guarantee you connect better with people around you. you can get long lasting free genuine natural highs and build up strong helpful healthy relationships at the exact same time. really consider this. is weed better than that no. its just easier and more comfortable. dare to be brave. this is a call to everyone thinking about smoking do not put yourself through that process over and over. just mourn and watch as it gets easier. humans are better at moving on from the loss of a friend or lover than you think and the same will be true for quitting. just have faith in yourself. the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. the opposite of addiction is connection. a person i do not remember edit 1 clarity thanks everyone for the kind words. i really love whenever experiences can help others everything i said are things you already knew we just need reminding when the cravings hit.,sadness
anyone else constantly feel youd be better off stoned when youre sober and sober when youre stoned im just curious if anyone else struggles with something similar to this. when i have not been smoking i get anxious overwhelmed and have trouble doing things like sleeping exercising regularly and just generally relaxing and finding the beauty in the little things in my life. i occasionally reach a tipping point and buy some weed and for while i experience a happy medium between the coherence of sobriety and the pleasure of enjoying my drug of choice. but usually within a week my self control has lapsed to the point where im smoking multiple times a day starting earlier and earlier in the day. it interferes with the things i want to get done things as basic as holding a conversation on track and not losing my train of thought. i reach another tipping point here where i throw out the weed i have left go cold turkey and get my shit back together. theeenn a while later a stressful event or the accumulation of little things will convince me that id be so much happier and effective in the things i want to get done if i could just take the edge off once in a while with some weed. cue the continuation of the cycle. anyone else have this kind of thing happen if so what are your go to strategies to get out of this loop edit you guys are great its comforting to know other people feel this way. im gonna come back to this post next time i feel like slipping up. i wish you all the brightest of pot free futures.,joy
one. month. sober its been a massive struggle im still having heaps of withdrawals and cravings but i made it a whole 30 days and counting,sadness
ive decided to give up weed. on this day february 12th i have finally decided to give it up. i am done with chasing that childhood sense of wonder. i realize that i am deeply nostalgic and used weed to feel like a kid again. its okay to grow up. i have finally confronted these feelings of mine. it is much more beneficial for me to leave this drug in the past. you either dream while youre awake or while youre asleep. you choose. goodbye. edit wow thanks for all the support you guys i really appreciate it.,joy
psa if youve got a good streak going breaking the seal makes temptation so much stronger took an edible after 7 months of no smoking 3 weeks ago. it was a fun time not without some reminders of why i quit in the first place but man the temptation to light up has been much more noticeable than before. it helped me realize that this whole journey is more than streaks but about the new habits and growth that comes about making changes even if you cant achieve a status every time. if youre thinking about taking a dip in stoned waters after a long time without just know that the slope is very slippery. i think about smoking quite a bit these days and when the temptation passes it always does i am very happy that i dont cave. ive come too far to get caught up in this habit again good luck yall i believe in you,joy
82 days without weed. got a pretty good job by passing a drug test. i got accepted for a job working in the machine shop of a big tractor and lawnmower manufacturer. i passed my drug screen. it was the first time i have passed a drug test without hiding a bottle of fake pee between my legs im feeling pretty proud about it. im going to get benefits and everythingt i start in 2 weeks. its my first big boy job,joy

its easier to keep a tiger in a cage than on a leash. once ive opened the cage the whole day revolves around topping up just to feel normal. i ca not moderate with any mind altering substance.,joy
4 days without smoking for the first time in 8 years been a heavy smoker for about 8 years now. always thought it was so stupid for people to say weed is bad for you or whatever. lately though ive realized with help from my lovely fiancé that ive just been hiding from the world. all i care about is smoking weed and playing xbox. ive realized that what the fuck are either of these things doing for me. i have nothing to show for being high or being good at video games. i know its only been 4 days but im really trying this time and this subreddit has helped tremendously. thanks you guys,sadness
one month clean and turned down my first offer to get high. surprisingly it was no real temptation. i ran into a friend and he slipped me his vape pen and i didnt even have to think about it i just told him no thanks i quit. honestly at this point id probably go into a panic if i got high. my life is better without it. im up early every morning im less moody and i love saving the money and not having to chase down my old dealer once a month. if youre reading this and only a few days in please dont give up time will pass and youll get over it.,sadness
long story short. decades of struggle. do not wast your time like i did. start smoking at 15 years old. smoking daily at 17. smoking heavily at 18. become depressed unmotivated. quit smoking at 25. start smoking again at 31. things will be different this time. end up smoking daily and heavily all over again. quit and relapse a million times. suffer like hell during withdrawals. heavy depression. manage to quit for 5 months and 9 months. both times start smoking again thinking that things will be different this time. end up smoking daily and heavily again. quit at 38. sober for 19 months now. life is good. do you really want to waste time like i did,sadness
goodbye rleaves. at first it was helpful to have peers going through the same mental hurdles in trying to separate from weed. thank you for your openness and honesty. but now you are my last remaining association to weed and that is a good thing. my final conclusion for you all it was never the weeds fault. i still like weed. i appreciate the fun we had. i appreciate the friends i have made smoking together. but i allow myself to become complacent when i am high. i settle for less and let myself think this is enough. success and personal growth are my new high. thanks to recent clarity i have doubled my income got in great shape and separated from the toxic people and behaviors that used to dominate my life. and who knows maybe one day down the road i will be able to roll one up again under better circumstances when the time is right. but until then cheers.,joy
day 370 so proud of myself i was perma stoned for about 20 years of my life. i smoked my way through so many milestones but i finally woke up i even did it with legal weed all around me including in my roommates medicine cabinet. i just wanted to brag and also to say that if i could do it you can too.,joy
i used to not be able to imagine life without weed today i mark 150 days clean. thank you so much to this sub for all the support motivation and inspiration. its been a long journey filled with highs and lows but i can say with confidence that i am far happier with the person i am today. i am in control of my thoughts and actions. i am living mindfully and actually accomplishing the things i want to. i realized i was an addict and i let that empower me every day as i live a sober yet fulfilled life. i wouldnt want to be any different of a person. own that shit. leaving is hard but we are all capable of it with the right mental framework and support. dont be afraid to ask for help it might just change your life. love you all and stay strong in these bizarre times.,joy
i want to look forward to life not just getting high when i smoke daily i find that it takes away or limits the pleasures of just eating food watching a movie socializing because youre thinking that it would be better if high instead of just enjoying what life has to offer. thats one of the main reasons i quit. i want to look forward to and enjoy life as it is without any substances altering my perception. i want to be grateful and appreciative and feel genuine joy by my life experiences not because i altered it with a plant to make it temporarily better.,joy
i finally hit the 6 month mark i never thought i could make it this far,joy
anyone else get crazy dreams after not smoking for a while once i stop smoking for a while i get these full blown vivid almost lucid dreams but they are crazy normally consisting of multiple people ive met in my life. basically a load of weird shit happens. im aware this is because weed doesnt allow you to enter rem sleep properly therefore not allowing your brain to dream. personally i find these dreams very interesting but when i wake up im happy the dream isnt real because its so intense and sometimes i relapse because of the dreams being too much lol. just wanted to know if anyone else experiences similar or the same thing.,surprise
i do not like getting high i only like the idea of getting high hey guys 10 years daily smoker and long time lurker here. i managed to stay sober for 2 months and just wanted to tell you what has changed since i quit. i get sooo much more shit done. in my job for example. when i smoked i finished 1 or 2 tasks a week. now i finish 5 tasks easily. im a much better partner to my girlfriend. just an example when i smoked it was usually her who made dinner while i sat on the couch smoking and playing video games. now we cook together or i do it while she can relax on the couch and i love it. and she loves it. im a much better friend to my friends. before when my friends went out to a bar i usually stayed at home because i would rather be alone and smoke. now i really like going out with them. in the first days after quitting i was afraid i would not like going out without weed but i quickly realized that its not hard at all. im a much better son and brother to my family. when i smoked i called my parents and siblings i live across the country maybe twice a month sometimes less. now i call them almost daily. im in way better shape. when i smoked my lungs started to hurt after 2 minutes on my bike now they do not hurt at all. also i really feel like doing something for my body work out go for a run etc. when i smoked i did not really care. i look better. i noticed that my eyes and teeth are cleaner and a lot of people told me i look „fresh woohoo i drink less alcohol. i thought i would be drinking more in order to compensate the missing weed flash but surprisingly i dont. as i said in the title i realized even long before quitting that i do not like being high i only like the idea of being high. when i imagined lighting up a joint it seemed so cool and relaxing and even kinda romantic but when i actually did it it just felt like feeding my addiction. for me the only hard part were the first two days. after that it became waaay easier. so if youre waiting for a sign here it is. do it. its worth it.,joy
a little trick that i use regularly to help with cravings 5 months clean. no we do not do that anymore. when my brain pops up and says hey lets smoke some weed which is still somewhat frequent i acknowledge that a certain part of me really wants to get high but then treat it like a 5 year old who wants to eat ice cream for breakfast. i know he does not understand all the reasons why he ca not have what he wants so i keep it simple no we do not do that anymore. we used to but we do not anymore. full stop. something about this mentality helps me let go of the craving even if its like a 5 year old saying aw man that sucks thats right 5 year old brain. that does suck. and also its not happening so move on. somehow i move on every single time. the point is. cravings are gonna show up. remember that you are the adult here and that there are plenty of good reasons not to smoke even if a certain part of you ca not remember all of them. make a hard rule and then make a part of you enforce it when the rest of you would rather not. theres a ton of other techniques that i use to stay clean but honestly repeating the phrase we do not do that anymore seems to be the one that i use the most these days. i recently quit nicotine which is its own terrible addiction and its working for that too.,joy
anyone become extrovertedsocial again after quitting i used to be very extroverted and loved hanging out with friends but during my 4 years of heavy weed use all i wanted to do was stay home alone and smoke. i hated seeing people and would always make excuses not to go out. day 4 here and i am realizing that its been so long since ive been social that i do not really know how to act around others anymore. i get really anxious now when i need to talk to people and overthink everything. im definitely not the same person i was before weed and it makes me sad. is there anyone who turned antisocial due to weed and went back to their old extroverted self after quitting any tips on how to be more social and make new friends thanks.,anger
the reason why you ca not even smoke one hit 16 days free what usually happens is that after a few weeks of not smoking weed you start to feel confident again. you do not feel cravings anymore and youre forgetting how strong was weeds grip on your life. you think to yourself that it is only one time and what could go wrong nbsp what people usually do not understand in this situation is that even after a few weeks or even a few months without using your brain is still not the same as a non smoker. your brain is the same as past user. and as past user your brain still has strong connections between weed and happiness. this is what caused your cravings and when you give your brain thc once again after so long you wake up all these strong connections that you have tried so hard to ignore. your brains craving to thc will be once again full blown. you will no longer be able to concentrate on anything other than smoking weed again. it takes weeks untill the intense feeling of craving weed will be manageable again. nbsp this is usually what makes people relapse most of the time. i know from experience that my last 3 attempts to quit weed failed exactly because of that confidence that came after a few weeks which lead to one hit. and after that one hit you get back that need so bad that you start abusing weed again extremely fast. nbsp i believe that understanding this is the key to make my current attempt successful. i am 16 days in the cravings had stopped. i know that if i will smoke only once in about 6 months maybe even in a year the cravings that it will cause will be unbearable. rewiring your brain to not like weed hat much takes lots of time. i am not going to risk it all anywhere in the near future it simply does not worth it. hope that this information will help you too,joy
my list of reasons to not smoke i really want to go buy a dab pen but im reminding myself why i shouldnt 1 it costs money 2 if i do it once ill want to do it all the time 3 my friends and family know i quit 4 bad for my lungs especially given the outbreak of a respiratory illness 5 ill accomplish nothing as soon as i get one 6 it will bring back that anxiety and emptiness that is impossible to fully understand sober 7 ill be damaging my brain 8 it conflicts with my medicine 9 i always end up watching shitty shows and feeling bored 10 staying sober is my 2020 resolution. ill immediately regret breaking this good streak ive got going,sadness

9 months clean 🥳🥳 what does 9 months feel like erm fing amazing actually. things really started to come together at 6 months but now i really do feel recovered in the physical sense. do not get me wrong i know therell be times when the cravings will return for a short while however ive 9 months worth of practice at ignoring them now so i know ill win. ive had the odd off day as happens in life and not once have i thought smoking will help. other things did pop into my head which could lead to smoking but i ignored those urges too. i must say i really felt like i was gong to be one of those people who had to go the full 2 years to beat paws but im not im one of the lucky ones. and god am i grateful. i guess what im trying to say to anyone who does read this is do not give up. you do not know when the tide will turn but as long as you keep going it will. just keep adding those days. that 30 second high is not worth selling out your future happiness for. plus after a while we do not even get high anymore anyways we just get numb. fk that noise and as always stay strong ♾❤️,joy

thank you leaves for being hands down the most supportive sub ive ever experienced i imagine many ppl on this sub can relate to mental health struggles in some form. whether it be addiction anxiety depression or way more. during my time on reddit and even off reddit ive joined many different support subs for various things and most claim to have the users best interest at heart and to be a no hate zone. meanwhile ive definitely witnessed and experienced first hand hate in many of those subs despite looking for support. todays been a really rough day for me not just bc mean reddit ppl but bc external life factors and covid isolation and work stress and weed cravings. this has been a really rough year honestly as im sure you all can relate. but despite all the pain and struggles it warms my heart to know that i can turn to this sub for genuine support without fear of insult or shame. so thanks leaves and everyone reading this you really are making a difference to others whether you realize it or not,love
dear weed thank you and god bless. you broke me in the loveliest subtlest way. you sidled up next to me held me by the hand and told me everything was all ok. you threw a smoke screen over the inferno that blazed and embered behind. you were my friend my partner in crime. long days spent together. picnicking with you. watching trains with you. long walks with you. concerts in tandem. watching cartoons with you. by the firelight. you showed me lots of good music. i looked for you all the time. i longed for you every night. i missed you all the time. but you were always there you were never too busy or too important or too complicated. my silent confidante. my trusted friend. you never left me. you never made me cry and when you did you were there to make it better. you never spoke but i knew you listened. you were my flame in a world of darkness. and just for a little while you made me forget the loneliness that cannot be touched. but we were selfish you wanted me all to yourself. i wanted you to myself. you liked being alone with me. and i liked being alone with you. so much so that i found after a while i had fallen in love with you. and that was a time. until i found that life and others had passed me by because of it. nothing waits. and it is with nothing but misery that you too made me realise all of this and that as lovely and loyal as you might be i must go now and leave you behind or this fires gonna catch us both.,love
after 8 years of daily use a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder i guess im ready to change. hi im glo and im addicted to thc. i started smoking weed as a teen with friends sometimes skipping school to get high but not often. then i got to college. i started smoking more often at least once or twice a week still just with friends though. then came moving into my first apartment shared with roommates and all the freedom of living away from parents and off of school property. i got myself my very own bong that year and thats when everything started to change. i began smoking daily after work at first then eventually in the morning before breakfast but hours before my nighttime work shifts. when i was 22 i met my ex d and fell in love hard and fast. he smelled of cannabis and coffee we worked at starbucks together and i loved it. he was a weed dealer back in the days before dispensaries were standard in toronto and smoked daily as well. i was always high when we were together. i started smoking at all times of day regardless of when i worked and being high became my normal. two years later d broke my heart and i did not want to feel anything. i started smoking much higher thc levels and more often i relied heavily on cannabis to numb my negative emotions. these emotions of mine are very intense as i have borderline personality depression and adhd. being high made me less reactionary less anxious more comfortable. its been 3 years since that breakup and despite multiple attempts at cutting back lowering my usage or quitting i have not been successful. i am dependent. i spend all my time thinking about the next chance ill have to smoke i do not socialize unless i can be high i do not allow myself to run out of weed even if it means going without groceries. i am terrified of the idea that i should quit for good and forever but i know i ca not go on like this. im lonely. im lethargic. my memory is hard to access. ive no motivation to do anything other than smoking weed. im late for work often a job i love because i just ca not motivate myself to be on time for anything ever. ive gained a lot of weight and never have enough energy to exercise. im numb and have not cried in over a year despite experiencing sad and even traumatic events in that time. i recently had a psychiatric consult because i thought these struggles were linked to my medications anti depressant mood stabiliser and wanted to try a different medication for the first time since going on antidepressants. the psychiatric team i consulted with diagnosed me with cannabis use disorder and explained that due to the amount ive been smoking every day for years now while my brain still developed and while i also struggle with bpd that it has caused long term effects on my cognitive functions and mood. they told me that it would be pointless to change my medication without me actually making a change in my cannabis consumption and addressing this addiction. so here i am. going to an addictions clinic next wednesday looking for support here and tomorrow night i am going to go to my first marijuana anonymous meeting very lucky that i live in toronto and there are options every weekday here but im scared. i do not know whats coming. i do not know how to accept this new reality. i do not know what to do to occupy my time as nothing seems to make me as happy as smoking weed does. nothing calms my mind the way smoking does. so theres my story im taking the first steps towards quitting and im terrified.,sadness
two years of freedom so its been almost 2 years of sobriety for me. maybe my testimony will give someone hope out there. my life has improved to an extent i didnt foresee. two years ago i was living with my parents working dead end minimum wage jobs and saving no money at all. i was failing college unhealthy and completely unmotivated. weed was legitimately the biggest barrier in my life. as soon as i quit i finally gained courage and motivationdrive to achieve things. now im in a career i absolutely love making more money than i even know how to spend and living on my own with plenty of savings and am in the market about to buy a house by myself. also two years ago my main and only hobby was smoking. now ive developed an intense passion for music and am well on my way to learning guitar and piano. ive also really seriously fallen in love with fitness primarily running and weightlifting and ive progressed much farther than i wouldve ever imagined i could. i could go on and on about the improvements in life but most important is that i have a constant level of peace in my heart and i really very very rarely go through bad times anymore. im not irritable and i gain much enjoyment doing things i could have never imagined wouldve given me enjoyment. ive really fallen in love with life and my mind is immeasurably quicker and sharper. every day i have an abundance of energy that allows me to very quickly move towards my goals. i know with 110 certainty that weed was my greatest inhibitor because everything started changing right when i freed myself from its grip.,joy
so i quit smoking weed on accident and i feel great. been a lurker on this sub with no real intention to stop smoking. was just nice to relate on some issues and enjoyed the camaraderie. but i would like to share my story sorry its a little long like i said ive been a lurker here and ive enjoyed many of your posts and saved a few of them and some comments i found very relatable and helpful. this is my first post or comment. i know part of me really just wants to keep smoking and act like its not a problem. while it may not be the root of all my problems it does not help me like it use to. it use to only positively effect me i was still happy and social even when i was high. it always made my body and mind feel good. it always felt right. thats definitely not the case anymore. maybe it is the root of my problems. i know its something i need to consider. i have been smoking since highschool and have not ever stopped its been over ten years. thats crazy to think about how much time ive kept the habit up. also since highschool ive smoked cigarettes drank beer and liquor have enjoyed a little share of hallucinogens and some rec drugs and have been able to let go of all of them at some point in my life. i smoked cigarettes since highschool stopped cold turkey for one and half years and now enjoy one every now and then. i still enjoy a drink every now and then and admit i can go a little heavy when i do but its not a craving or habitual i can just drop it unlike weed which ive literally never let go of since i started and if i did not have it everything sucked and i probably would not feel like doing anything until i found some weed. anyway my dealer took a week off for the holidays and i did not get enough to last me until he was open again. smoked the last i had about a week ago and i was plotting to get some as soon as he was back. hes been back for a few days but i have not gone to him. i feel great and actually beginning to feel a little proud of myself. i also have an insane amount of energy thats almost annoying haha but its probably because i do not have anything to put my energy into. i do want to be honest with everyone here and out of respect for people who actually have quit i feel like i should admit that i have dry hit my pipe a few times and smoked resin. i do not want to lie and i hope its alright that i still post this. i ca not say enough how much i respect this sub and the people here. you all seem like very understanding and loving people. im sorry if what im posting is not what this sub is meant for but i feel like this is the place i could come to and share my experience and i just want to be one hundred percent honest and transparent. im sorry if i am in the wrong and i understand. even though i have not technically stopped i feel great. work is better i feel full of life again and i can express myself with much more ease. i think thats the best part. my wit and humour is strong again its great. i absolutely love making people laugh its a great natural high it definitely hits that rewardpleasure spot in my head and it feels great haha i do suffered from over anxiety and have a had a couple severe panic attacks to the point i thought i was having a seizure. i hope this change will help it would be nice to be able to go into new social situations or be on an airplane and not worry im going shit and vomit all over myself from being anxious haha another reason im really excited about this change is because the relationship im in right now is struggling. i live with my girlfriend which weve done before and ended up going different ways. she also smokes but i feel like she smokes more because im around shes not the best at finding it or amounts and prices. she would not even really try to get any and i know she would honestly love it if i stopped smoking. theres a good chance we go our separate ways again at the end of our lease but i want to do this for the both of us. i know at the end of the day it should be about me and improvment for myself but if we do separate i want to leave each other better than when we got together again. i want to be that force of positive action for her. shes had a tough life and shes worked hard to improve it little by little with what she had which was nothing. shes tired of being disappointed and i know ive contributed to that feeling. she feels like a failure and i want to be able to change that idea that we have failed. i want to be a partner whos ready to live a full life and really share some experiences with each other and not just floatcoast through life which is all ive been doing. i want to be a source of positivity of motivation and i want to inspire her and everyone i come across be their best to care to try to better yourself even in the smallest ways. push yourself to be that great person you already are. theres nothing you need to add to become a better person you just need to pull it from within yourself and become the master of your own seas. i would appreciate any support you have on my journey to mastering the sometimes rough seas and lets help each other to calmer waters. thank you for reading i appreciate and love all of you edit wow. thank all of you so so much. im honestly in tears right now because i have all of you at my back just like that. you are all so amazing. ill admit for some reason im scared to fully commiting to quiting and i think its because part of me does not think i actually can. but what i do know because of all of you is that i am on the right track. failing is not what i want to do but it happens and we get back up and fight another day. ive always been a fighter but i was honestly at my limit. thank you all from the bottom of my heart for giving me hope and strength again. i will remain a regular here and pass forward the love and support i have gotten from all of you. i have a friend who says water is life life is love and gratitude. so life is two parts gratitude and one part love. h2o. some hippy shit but thank you thank you i love you all. one last thing i just commented on another post here about anxiety and i would like to share. its not really a fight it should not be a battle. give your problems space to be. the more space you give them the more clear they become to be. the clearer they are the more you understand yourself and you can tame and even conquer it. but its not a battle the more i fought the less i had control over myself. you ca not out think your problems. it takes strong will surrendering to the things you have no power over and action over the ones you do. ive honestly always loved the serenity prayer which is similar even though im not religious because it captures that perfectly. thanks again everyone i feel like ill sleep pretty good tonight even without a smoke. i hope the same for everyone else. see you around friends peace and love ☺️,joy
how to live without weed i have been smoking for so long. im 31 now and started at 15. pretty much my whole adult life. i have been doing it so long i cannot remember how to live without weed. my whole life has been shaped by it i need it to have fun and relax but i am also antisocial on it. i need it to play my guitar to play pc games to have deep conversations with myself and others. but nowadays i just dont feel good when i smoke because of anxiety. its so scary to quit because i dont know what i would do without it but i cant live like this anymore. it used to be a crutch for me and ultimately i think it is what stopped me from figuring out how to be my best self. its weird because only when i am high will i have these toughts. getting home from work sober i wont even think twice about not smoking. the sober me wants to smoke for relief. high me wants to quit for relief. i cannot ever get it and it is really scary. ill pick up my guitar sober and it sounds so bad. ill boot up a game and quit after 5 minutes. and worst when i toke up i am so antisocial i will not even respond to text from my friends. i have lost good friends this way. i have lost the ability to have casual conversations since all i did for the last 10 years is get home and smoke. i want to have a normal life. but my mind has been so rotten from weed abuse for so long i cannot remember how to live without it. what are some tips that helped you how long am i gonna feel this way will i ever be able to live a normal human life,joy

just checked how many since last time with mary jane literally teared up at the number 176. longest time away since i started 14 years ago.,anger
the idea of smoking and being high is much better than actually being high. for those of you still in the process of quitting i encourage you to try and notice exactly how you feel next time you get high. this has helped me tremendously in realizing that i do not need weed in my life. next time you smoke just spend 30 second or a minute just thinking exactly about how you feel right now and why it something that you enjoy. after many times of examining myself while stoned i realized that it kinda sucks. youre ability to socialize with other people is extremely diminished your desire to do anything productive is gone eating healthy foods no longer does it for you the euphoria the you feel is often very mild and extremely short lasting followed by a tiresome haze etc. each person will have their own reasons and need to notice it for themselves. so for anyone out there still trying to quit give this a try.,joy
i stood up for myself. today i was at friends place i told her about what im going through at the moment and how tough it is to quit. i then left for an hour and when i came back there was a guy smoking a big joint in the living room. i did not say anything because he was more of a guest than i was i often stay at that friends place they were both high. then we had dinner and i was feeling really bad. during that time i felt high without smoking passive smoke i guess. once dinner was over i asked my friend if i could talk to her in private i was panicking because i have been avoiding situations like these so that i would not be tempted to smoke again. i told her i had to leave because the situation was really difficult for me i could not cope with it. so i packed my things and left. i felt really bad about it and guilty like i was a drama queen for leaving like this but now that im home i feel good that i stood up for myself and did not stay there. english is not my native language i do apologise if i made mistakes,sadness
stopping weed make me realize i have low self esteem title says it all. been smoking for 12 years daily unless im on vacation or some special circumstance. my mental health was ok until the last couple of years. but i would smoke to forget my problems and to make myself feel good without having to accomplish any of my goals and to daydream that one day just around the corner id be some big shot who everybody loved. well after trying to quit and lasting 3 weeks i realize that i do indeed have low self esteem. basically i am full of self doubts i am constantly judging myself against others negatively like judging myself against geniuses and olympians jeezuz and i talk down to myself saying i am just lacking something. just the regular im not good enough thoughts. and i have discovered the roots in my childhood and upbringing never being complimented never being praised when i did well etc. textbook relapse too buying a little bit of weed everyday and smoking it all as this is my last time then doing it all again the next day so i am getting therapy because i need it for sure but yea i suspect a lot of people on here also are suffering from low self esteem and smoke to forget because thats what i did. well i hope you can get past it. i hope i can get past it with regular work on my part i know i can. i do not care if it takes 10 years i will be a better me. stopping smoking has had all these negative thoughts flood back into my mind. and its long overdue. so i guess i gotta pay my dues and put in my work on myself. all the time i spend smoking years of my life was spent to forget myself. well now i must look clearly and work on myself so i can improve what i do not like. i am in control of my life now not the weed.,joy
i dont think keeping track how many days sober is a great idea. i know it may feel good to say 10184285 days but i think it can add unwanted stressanxiety. because really youre focusing on days without. for me its a lifestyle change. i dont know how many days its been now and dont really care. whats most important is weed and its negative effects on my life are gone. im focused more on my quality of life now and that has no number.,joy
day 600 that ive had my life back. surreal. hugely thanks to rleaves.,surprise

do not quit quitting hey everyone im a fairly well recovered stoner. i was high pretty much 247 for 5 years from when i was 19 years old. i quit the daily habit in january 2017 with a few minor relapses since. this sub is great and i really love the support here. i wanted to add some personal advice it may work for you it may not. if youre struggling id encourage you to read ahead. heres the gist of why i managed to quit it was a fucking long process. quitting for me was not a case of just deciding one day to go cold turkey. that flat out did not work for me. like many of you here i wanted to quit for a seriously long time before i actually did. i hated myself for ages even though i kept reaching for the green. ill do it tomorrow ill finish this bag first ill do it after the party on the weekend. like having to break up with someone there was simply never going to be a good time to do it. it took a six week trip to europe for me to hit the reset button cause i was too chicken shit to buy drugs in a foreign country except amsterdam. the sobriety i had was liberating. life was so much clearer. it helped that i was on holidays but that does not mean its impossible to do what i did if youre at home. my point is its not like everything just changed for me when i quit. i still had my old habits. my addict brain still had cravings still does to this very day. and i slipped more times than i can count. but you know what quitting is like any other habit it gets easier the more you do it. maybe counting the days works for you and if it does i do not want to take that away. but so many of you on this sub seem to obsess on day counting. my advice just one day at a time. thats your focus right now. day 4 day 15 day 57 does not matter. what matters is that youre sober today. if you slip you slip. do not use this as an excuse to smoke tonight. but similarly do not use it to beat the living piss out of yourself if you relapse either because i can guarantee you that hating on yourself is the surest and fastest way to impeding your progress. tldr quitting ai not a light switch. its a muscle. try hard and try often and persist in your goal. youll get there eventually.,joy

3 days in and realizing a lot of shit. for years ive been the weedman for my group of so called friends but as ive sat here alone for days without anyone outside my immediate family wondering where i am if im okay ive learned that a shitton of the people i know just use me for weed or access to other narcotics. im taking a stand today. this is not the first time ive tried to quit and i do have a problem. especially with thc cartridges. i have no self control but this drug has a grip on me like no other. ive quit cocaine heroin and i used to be a heavy mdma user. but nothing has a hold on me like ol mary jane. im going to a meeting tonight thanks for being here guys. tldr another plug off the streets,sadness
one. year. free. 2 days ago on june 13 2020 marked my 1 year weed and other subtance free. i spent more than 5h browsing this forum with people having the same difficulty as i had when i stopped smoking weed. i stopped because of a panic attack when i was high. the first 6 months were the most difficult of my entire life. the first 3 the most horrendous. but everything was a downhill after that. i experienced extreme anxiety panics fear weight gain and thousands of unpleasantnesses. i went to psychotherapy because of my anxiety. i started working out because of my weight gain. i started getting out of my comfort zone because of my fear and i started to enjoy life rather than smoking weed every night. i do not regret it. it made me better. i did not know who i was what my limits were and what i was capable to do before i stopped smoking. i was always picked by others as the lazy one. turns out im not a lazy guy. turns out i can get the job done and i can wake up early. after i stopped my life was back on track. i sleep now better. i eat better. my emotions are under control. i remember things. to whomever this is relatable please try to stop and please understand that every emotion you feel is temporary. please go through my reddit profile and check what i have posted and commented. you can notice my anxiety in the comments ive left and threads i have created. life is worth living with your eyes open and mind cleared. weed does not help. weed does not define you. love you all. love leaves. ❣️,sadness
its been two months without weed and im still thinking about weed. first i need to say that the abstinence i felt before is completely gone it must have lasted a week but i thought that soon it passed soon i would forget but two months have passed and it keeps coming back to my mind i am almost unconsciously looking for an excuse to buy and use again. today is my birthday and i have been thinking about buying to celebrate it the whole week but i know that if i do all that desire i had will come back again and i do not want that at all. i wish the day that this drug would vanish completely of my mind and i could live normally but i do not think it will. thanks for reading.,sadness
rleaves and sober october hi all since were seeing a whole bunch of new visitors as a result of sober october welcome i wanted to clarify our policy as we will be modding out some posts and comments related to sober october. sober october is about taking a break for a month. taking a break to reset your tolerance or re evaluate your relationship with smoking are all great things to do but we are a narrowly focused sub for people who have made the difficult decision that they have to stop for good. as a result unless you make clear that you are using sober october as your day 1 to a cannabis free life well be taking out sober october posts. as i say breaks are great if thats what you want but its just not what we do. the good news is that theres a terrific group for support with taking breaks and managing moderation called rpetioles. they can help you make sober october a success and when halloween comes around and you decide its actually time to quit for good then youll always be welcome back to rleaves. good luck with whatever path you decide to take subduction,joy

weed is harmless for some but for the addict it is a terrible life stealer. weed can be insidious precisely because it seems so harmless. and sadly the recent societal acceptance of its use only reinforces this false perception. it makes quitting very difficult for those of us who really need to stay off it for the rest of our lives. ‘its just a little weed whats the big deal is constantly playing in our heads tempting us back to it. and what makes it even harder is that for most people weed is really perfectly ok when done in moderation. but for those of us who tend to abuse it weed is as dangerous as any drug can be to living a truly full life. while the danger is not that weed could kill us the fact that it is not deadly only makes it less likely that we will ever quit. meanwhile its non deadly effects slowly steal our life away by putting life on fast forward and distracting our minds from very achievable and important goals. ive been clean for about 6 months after a 27 year habit. the most powerful perception that has kept me sober is realizing how much time i wasted chasing the weed high. that meaningless fiendish chase blocked me from chasing and achieving so many positive things in my life. that chase robbed me of even solid memories of the few things i did achieve. its all a blur. weed speeds up time. thats what it does especially when you abuse it. if you are a weed addict you should quit just so you can live and savor true life and not just some fleeting high. quit so you wont miss out on all that life has to offer. quit because if you continue abusing weed one day you will wake up old and tired in no time wondering with great sadness where all that time went. that is the ultimate injury of each so called great high that weed provides us addicts. at the end of that road is nothing but a wasted life and deep regret for what you could have been without a substance that made you artificially happy no matter how little you accomplished.,joy
hello fellow sobers. anyone else noticed how vivid your dreams are becoming or is it just me,joy
you have already survived the worst day of your life. what is the discomfort you are feeling right now compared to that right now you are making your way towards freedom and a better life to not be addicted and to live as your true self. this is just a temporary moment in time where you go through withdrawals and cravings. how often have you regretted a day of being sober how often have you regretted smoking when you actually did not have to and you only realise it as soon as you are high again right now all the discomfort you are experiencing come from weed not your sobriety. once your body deals with the remnants of the plant and once you let go of the bad habit you are clearly wanting to let go you wo not feel so uncomfortable. when you fight in your head about to smoke or not to smoke it is draining. your body and mind may say that you would feel better right now if you just smoked a little. while that may be true you would know it does not last forever. sooner or later you will be faced with this discomfort again so why not now why wait and postpone your freedom why feel the same suffering over and over again before you have the courage to stay still through the cravings you have the power to quit at any time you are stronger than your emotions. you have the power of your free will and while the habits and addiction patterns in your brain tells you to smoke you can just be. they wo not make you do anything its only when you keep fighting them and you are tired from fighting that you give in its always your power it always will be. everytime you decide no that thought of wanting to smoke loses some of its power. after awhile it does not take much to say no because that pathway in your brain is dying out slowly but surely. youll get dreams of smoking glorified thoughts of good times when you smoke and idealisation of being high when you quit that is normal. do not be scared of the thoughts. when you notice you tense up you can for example just sit a few minutes and feel everything in your body. follow your breath and notice you are fine. even if you feel like shit at the moment you are alive theres nothing to worry about. it will get better it will get better. do not lose sight of what you want do not give into fear. keep going my fellow leaves. even when its hard it just strengthens you. be proud of yourself even when you get the smallest time off. do not blame yourself when you are learning everyday is a new opportunity to learn you have not thrown everything away when you relapsed after a streak. you can learn from your failures. for me it is currently day 14 and while i still feel like im recovering i do not feel nearly as bad as the first 1 10 days. i get thoughts of smoking but i know it is not worth it so ill keep going and i keep telling myself im still recovering. sleep is getting better and that feels good still it is not a reason to smoke the tiniest bit. ive already experienced being addicted it is not fun and im tired of fooling myself and keeping myself from achieving things that i want because im afraid and its easier to fall back to the reason of being high and post poning things. i wish all the best to you. edit i wanted to add this quote i posted sometime earlier in a comment we must all suffer from one of two pains the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. the difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons.,sadness
heavy smoker for 3 years. i just made it a month clean. i used to go through an 18 every 2 3 days. i would smoke when i woke up before work as soon as i got home before every meal right before bed and even in the middle of the night if i woke up so i could fall back asleep. i would carry a vape pen with me so i could smoke if i was away from home even during my lunch breaks at work. i was basically high all the time. beginning of july i went cold turkey and gave it all up. i didnt like the person i became and it wasnt the person i wanted to be. the first few days were hard. sleeping was almost impossible and i didnt have an appetite but i persisted. it got better after the first week and i began having dreams again when i slept. my appetite struggled for a bit but now im eating fine. i kept myself busy so i wouldnt relapse. i joined a rock climbing gym and began being social again. weed kept me contempt being home locked in my room alone. now im excited to get out of the house. the biggest change ive noticed is time doesnt fly for me now. the past three years felt like a quick blur this past month has felt like an eternity. its only been 31 days but i feel like ive lived more in that time then the three years being high. im thankful for this sub and everyones inspiring storys. reading what other people are going through and seeing that they could do it helped me not relapse and push through. i know you can do it too.,joy

i threw away all of my weed today i have been masking depression with weed and have been high every day of this quarantine. i could not do anything without smoking first. i gained probably 10 pounds did not keep up with studies and have honestly been worthless. i fooled myself into thinking i had moderation and that i could quit at any time. when i realized that this was not the case i knew i was addicted. but there is good news i doused my weed with cleaner so i could not change my mind and threw it away. the next few days will be hard but i will come out better on the other side. i have read through this subreddit often and really appreciate the stories shared. i do not have a community because i live alone during this quarantine so having this outlet to see other stories has been amazing.,sadness
this is my first birthday in a decade not waking up and smoking weed i was 24 years old when i smoked my first bit of weed and it only got worse from there but i quit 25 days ago and its been going strong. this is the longest ive gone without smoking and this community has been a real help in achieving that goal. thank you all and have a great weed free day,joy
500 days today is exactly 500 days since quitting weed i still ca not quite believe i actually did it and stuck to it. i have also quit nicotine since then too. just wanted to say to anyone who is struggling in the early stages of quitting to keep at it. do not give up. a sober life free from weed is completley worth the initial struggle. edit for context i smoked daily for about 12 years before quitting between a quarter and a half ounce per week and quit cold turkey,joy
i promised myself id only smoke at the weekend. now once again i ca not go a day without it. no more starting today. this may be a familiar story. we tell ourselves weed is not that bad there are much worse things i could be doing. ill just do it occasionally and itll be fine then you have a stressful day at work well i suppose i could treat myself then you get ill well i may as well get high since ill be in bed all day anyway and all of a sudden youve been smoking daily for 2 weeks without even realising it. since the covid 19 quarantine id fallen into the particular trap of treating myself because of the scary and stressful situation i found myself in. well now its time to treat myself to some clear headedness. time to get my motivation back. i wanna say a big thank you to everyone here for the inspiring posts ive read here and the general sense of community this sub provides. this is my day 1. wish me luck,joy
6 months sober i cant believe im saying this shit. its been amazing. after 6 7 years of living the same day ive finally made it out. energy levels restored. ive been working out like crazy and saving up my money. the beginning was tough but my appetite is finally back to normal. no trouble sleeping. i really had a huge budget for pot and never for anything else. im able to treat myself with nice things now. it feels great. my relationships with people have gotten better and ive somewhat busted out of my introverted ways. no more ups and downs with my mentality for the most part everything seems like its on a clear plane an even line of vision. no more weird bouts of paranoia. my desire to burn has gone up in smoke. i dont feel the want to go back to the lifestyle. 6 months might not seem like a lot but after 7 damn years of daily hourly smoking it feels like quite the accomplishment. were in this together. try your best to make the change if you feel trapped. good luck to everyone,joy
im a sucker for instant gratification and weed is the lynchpin i overeat. i procrastinate. i lay around. i am a porn addict. i can spend crazy amounts of time on my phone. i have bouts of alcoholism. i am just a complete fiend for stimulation at my core and really its been that way as long as i can remember. weed just made it all way worse. whenever i remove weed from the equation i gain momentum with abstaining from the rest of my vices. the other habits fall like a house of cards. it is so illogical that i keep falling into this trap. im so tired of it. i dont enjoy smoking weed anymore but whenever i abstain for a little bit a week if im on a good streak it always just feels like somethings missing. i let my guard down take a toke and fall right back to square one. its incredible the mental gymnastics it takes to convince myself itll be just once and it inevitably never is. but for some reason i am discontent to some extent in either stage. whats really sad is that weed is like really bad now. im pretty sure im allergic from the reaction my body has to it. i dont know why anyone likes hanging out with me when im high because i just shut off. i become this zombified fiend. nine times out of ten ill be miserable and immediately wish i was sober. somehow i convince myself it wont be that way though. well no time like the present to try again. i cant concede to the idea that i cant do it because that isnt true. i just need to try harder and be honest with myself about how hard i am trying and remind myself how terrible i always feel when i slip. thanks for reading if anyone bothered to read all that. would appreciate pointers.,anger

suffering by comparison the illusion of weed i think for many people it can be difficult to come to the understanding that they are better without weed. its become so mainstream and pervasive in culture. there are tons of myths and misconceptions about it mostly about how harmless it is. who has not heard someone rant about why weed should be legal or how its not as bad as alcohol as if its a novel point also weed as many have pointed out does not usually ruin lives. you can be high 247 and still make the case that youre life is fine. its somehow become acceptable to be high all the time yet it someone gets drunk every night they are an alcoholic this combined with the fact that weed generally enhances any experience causes us to be weary of the idea that being sober is better. i read in an article how can weed be bad if its good the fact that weed is good is the reason its bad. it is a form of pleasure that is incredibly accessible and powerful. at first weed will just make other pleasure more intense like hanging with friends or going into nature. over time though it just becomes an act of desperation melting into your couch watching mediocre sitcoms and eating junk food. even though what i described above does not sound all that great and it really isnt for a stoner its the best thing they have. weed take precedence over other pleasures. its a sad but very true fact. if you smoke all the time you will simply be less interested in connecting socially. you wo not feel the same about your hobbies. everything you once enjoyed will suffer by comparison to the extreme pleasure of smoking. the mundane everyday drill of life will lose any of the excitement and novelty it had. youll just be angrily trudging through the mud until you finally find relief getting high at home. and even that starts to suffer by comparison to the old days when you first started smoking. so when youre trying to quit and after a while the whispers in your ear try to convince you that your relationship with weed was not really all that bad just remember that it was. you quit for a reason. understanding the above has helped keep me from relapsing. i try to remember albert einsteins definition of insanity which is to try something over and over again expecting different results.,joy
one year hey everyone. tomorrow will be one entire year without smoking after ten years of daily use. i see there are many new members. i joined a little over a year ago and this community really helped me with my decision. i just wanted to thank all of you. the withdrawals and then the boredom were rough for a couple of months but now its almost like i dont think about it anymore at all. i turned my smoking time into reading time and that really helped me get through the tougher times of quitting. overall id say my mental health has improved. i went up to a healthy weight as i was frail and couldnt eat if i wasnt high. i feel sharp and like a weight is off of me and i feel clarity like i am in control of my life. i have been going to therapy regularly and have been managing and working through my anxiety ptsd and depression in healthy ways instead of escaping like i always did with smoking. my grandfather was a longtime smoker as well and lately he told me that you are the captain of the starship to think anything in your life is in control is resigning your responsibility to yourself and i wanted to pass that to you guys. im hope someone sees this and it helps them keep pushing forward. big love to you all.,joy

instead of shaming yourself try this came across this today thought it could help the community instead of its bad im bad that i need drugs to feel better. try its extremely resourceful that my nervous system has found something to regulate itself. i wonder what else i could utilize thats inside myself and would make me feel better in the long run,joy
instead of smoking myself to sleep i read on day 20. last night i hung out with a bigger group didnt like one interaction so i removed myself from the situation. when i got home i was replaying the interaction in my head. i definitely wanted to smoke but i decided to read a book instead. within 20 minutes i was sound asleep. woke up today accepting of last nights discomfort. its wild that i can choose to handle lifes realities instead of smoking for hours straight. loving this shift in values action and perspective. feeling proud about my recent choices,joy
do not let the festivities of the 4th of july holiday trick you into smoking. fire up some fireworks or the grill instead. you can do it.,anger
smoking to sleep bad quality sleep smoking to wake up not waking up and smoking for fun nothing is fun. time. to. quit. these are the facts and unless i get it down to at most twice a month my life is going to continue this downward spiral. yesterday i had a great day stuck to my schedule and got everything done. sober. so i decided to reward myself at the end of the day not with meditation and a good book but with pot and some good ole dota 2 video games. the 2 hours i planned for relaxing at the end of the day turned into 7 fucking hours and i was up until 4am getting high as hell and playing games. it was sort of fun but here i am the next day groggy sleepy bored unproductive and already out of time in the day to get done what i need to get done. i hate this. all i want is to follow my schedule have good habits and acheive my goals. i do not want to spend hours and hours alone in the dark with online strangers whilst doing drugs. what do you guys tell yourselves if you slip up i tend to dwell on this type of thing and right now im quite mad at myself love you,sadness
quitting tip ive found useful almost four weeks clean after smoking all day everyday for years. just thought id share something that has helped me so far. basically start a list and record everything youve achieved since quitting keep adding to it regularly and whenever youre tempted to smoke read over the list. itll remind you why you chose to give it up in the first place and show you what can be accomplished without mary. my list has stuff on it like sorted out drivers liscense getting more sociable and so on. hope this helps. good luck and remember you can do this,joy
day 16 quitting does not give you motivation just throwing this one out here guys. i notice when i quit i expect a miracle to happen. i know i feel a lot better after getting over the first few weeks but i expect myself to be some energetic productive superwoman again. i read a post on another subreddit and it made me realize ill never magically feel motivated just from quitting alone. you have to motivate yourself to live the life you want. you will not wake up one day and all of sudden be the perfect version of yourself. you need to get your ass off the couch or out of bed and do something. make a list even a small one. just like youre committing to quitting you have to commit to do the things youre struggling to do. once i figured this out i feel like im on cheat mode. yes some days im just tired and dont feel like it. or i sneak and get my dopamine from some other activity. every time that i commit to doing the things ive been struggling to do i feel so powerful. its literally a lot easier than you think. just go do it. youre not couch locked anymore. you have the time. this time i quit i did it without the theatrics. i ran out of weed. i started revaping my avb and just realized enough was enough. i didnt want to pick up again and restart the cycle. so i vaped enough to sleep through that night and flushed the rest down the toilet. the first week was hard especially for my emotions but since then ive been on cruise control. my minds still cloudy im still craving but im finding time for other things. tonight i spent 2.5hrs doing something i struggled to get done for the past 3 months. i did by telling myself im not letting one more day go by with this task not complete. i got off the couch and did it. go figure. you can do this it just takes a little bit of focus and commitment. edit i didnt expect this to blow up overnight. thanks for the dopamine this morning lol. have a productive day,joy
i didnt buy weed today i just turned 21 yesterday so for the last 7 years i have been smoking marijuana regularly and for the last 4 years i havent been able to go more than 24 hours without smoking. i dont smoke copious amounts just a bowl once or twice a day. i have crohns disease and it helps bring back my appetite alleviate inflammation and generally helps me when it comes out of remission. it sucks because it genuinely helps me with my disease which makes it even harder to even begin fighting my dependence. and my dependence is just that. i spend hundreds of dollars on weed every year and i am a very poor college student. because i have no control. i must always have it and when i begin running low i hit my man for another 12 ounce. when i dont have it i go crazy. my anxiety flares to its worst places. i panic over everything. my life plan feels hopeless the tasks i need to complete seem impossible the consequences to failing feel like theyll be the literal end of the world. i cant relax. i cant focus. i cant enjoy the things i like to do when im high which is everything. suicidal thoughts sometimes come in common as thinking about the weather. it has nothing to do with the high either. i can be high as fuck but the second i finish my last bud the panic sets in untill ive worked out with my dealer what time im picking up the next day. theres physical effects on my body as well. i stop eating almost completely as my appetite is gone. for example when i travel with friends outside the country i lose weight like crazy because i physically cant eat while i dont have access to marijuana. my friends who are coincidentally non smokers literally make it a priority to figure out how to safely get their sick friend weed any time we travel then plan around finding places where i can smoke so i can actually eat around every meal. it makes me feel like a huge burden to them. on a different trip to the middle east it was even harder and more dangerous to find and my weight dropped over thirty pounds while i was there. my doctor was immensely alarmed but just chalked it up to heat and an exit from remission rather than the more serious problem that i have not that ive discussed it with her. i want to quit so bad. i have law school coming up after my final year in college and beyond that the world. im tired of this shackle holding me down where ever i go. two days ago i realized that i was running out. but rather than immediately dropping another 90 on a 12 ounce i decided i would wait until the next day. yesterday something within me told me that i could do this. and i was able to resist texting my dealer and forced myself to eat lightly. today i kept myself busy with work and studying for the lsat but in the back of my mind the urge and panic remained gnawing at me. i felt like i knew i was going to break down when i was home for the night and go buy again. but i didnt. its now 3am and im resisting the urge to get my pipe and do a resin hit. i know that i have a long long way to go and i dont know if i can ever have a casual relationship with weed or if i need to cut it out completely. i also dont know that im strong enough to keep this up. but for the first time in years i didnt buy weed today.,sadness
life is so much better when your mind isnt always occupied with the thought of when and how youre going to get high next. when i was using heavily the thought of when am im going to high next and how am i going to get high next mainly because i was broke from blowing all my money on weed was never far from the forefront of my mind. it was practically my daily goal. i hated it. now that im not smoking i can focus my attention time energy and money on much more meaningful and fulfilling things such as family and friends its very freeing not to be a slave to addiction.,sadness
day 23. looking back while i was using weed took up so damn much mental space. i was always thinking about it in some way. the best part of quitting has been having the freedom to focus on life instead.,joy
instead of killing time make use of it. life keeps going after weed theres so much to do i used to smoke to kill time now i been finding things to do. suddenly life is happening before my eyes and im choosing to actively be a part of it. theres dishes to be cleaned recipes to make dogs to walk people to see workouts to happen. theres so much going on its been two weeks and i think i do not have anymore time left to kill. i even painted the other day. it was not a masterpiece but it was something.,joy
almost there ca not believe it,fear

all you 20 somethings quitting smoking you are awesome i am so jealous of you all making these realisations at your age. you are young you have a whole life ahead of you. you have made a decision that will make that life better one way or another. it took me until my late 30s to come to the same realisations as you and i am now thousands and thousands of ££s in debt. dont be me. dont wait until the debt and the guilt have eaten away at any self respect you might have had. even if you look at your life and think its a pile of shit thanks to weeddepressioninsert life issue here you are taking a huge step towards improving your life by admitting that weed isnt helping you and choosing a life without it. you have my utmost admiration and respect for that. 🌟,joy
day 57 my mood is finally starting to level out. took me about 50 days or so to start to feel normal. this takes time commitment consistency hard work and most of all patience. stick with it do not give in guys and gals my mood has been much more consistent. before if i had a lack of sleep that was a trigger for a depressing day. no joke id be stressed and angry and just not in a good mood and i would be depressed. now im just tired like a normal adult. wake up in a decent moodkinda excited or whatever but just tired like a normal fucking adult. i track my moods and the last week has been great. even on sunday i was hungover af but i was not depressed or triggered to smoke i was just tired and hungover lol. no matter what you do do not fucking give in. you will lose your progress and got to start over and go through all that depressive bullshit again. i have never been more determined to not smoke again or for a longgggg ass time. i love this consistent moodsobriety life. here are some keys 1. consistent exercise 2. good diet 3. talking with people and stepping out of your comfort zone 4. compliment and love yourself 5. take ownership of your life and stop being a bitch. stay sober. do the hard thing. be an adult. no one gives a shit about you except you. be cognoscente of your life decisions. the past is the past the present in now and the future is determined by what you do right now. 6. fill your schedule with other things. you have to swap out being a stoner and doing nothing for actually doing something. boredom is the biggest trigger to smoke. good luck my friends please reach out if you want to talk. i am here for you,joy
wish me luck 😐,joy

60 days herbfree goddamn ive never been this sober in 24yrs. been smoking since i was 15yrs old and im 39 now. i planned on stopping jan 1st 2020 but i woke up dec 15th 2019 took my weed trays papers bongs pipes and just three in the the trash. i couldnt deal with the pressure of having to wait till the 1st so i was like fuck it lets get it over it. the 1st week was hell on earth shout out to mobbing deep. but this community has been my saving grace. you guys and gals have supported me because ive never felt alone throughout my journey. during the toughest of times this community always has a positive person that gives me encouraging advice that keeps me going. im taking it one day at a time never think about tomorrow until it gets here. to all my fellow quitters thank you and keep it up. i appreciate you all.,sadness
1 year365 days weed free this is what ive learned a no bs guide so youve decided you wanna quit smoking weed. maybe youve been thinking about it for a while and youre yet to make the change. maybe youve started quitting already and its early days. or maybe youve tried and failed multiple times and are just finding it too easy to get back to smoking that shit and going back to square one. this has ended up kinda long but ive tried to keep it readable. besides spending a few minutes making the effort even if you dont feel like it at the beginning might be the kind of thing you can apply in your attempt to quit weed for good more on that later. some background bear with me. i personally tried and failed a few times i went about 6 weeks during one effort. there was a week here a day or two there. i always seemed to go back to it at some point but i wanted to quit and i didnt like the way my life was with weed being a constant part of it during my days of peak usage and even at minimal usage to be honest itd be stuff like choosing to smoke after work instead of building new skills being too stoned to cook so ordering shitty expensive takeaways or avoiding eating altogether doing the bare minimum in terms of household tasks wanting to watch a movieplay a video game high but as soon as i was high i couldnt even be bothered to choose a film or start up a game id just sit in front of youtube consuming short form videos at the press of a button as it got later into the night and the videos got progressively more useless. being too lazy to brush my teeth before bed pissing in a bottle sometimes instead of leaving my room to walk across the landing and use the toilet at night being unreliable disorganised life admin tasks building up around me putting off social engagements because id rather be in my little stoned bubble. it was disgusting. pathetic. i was 33 when i began my most recent effort to quit and weed had been a part of my life to varying degrees since i was around 17. for a while there it was great. smoking after work with friends and laughing until it hurt smoking alone and having all my activities enhanced and just… better. i moved in with some friends and we all smoked every night played games and just had a great time. i was in my twenties now and weed was just the best. things were fun and weed made it even more so. i moved in with a girl and my usage dipped. it was still in my life once or twice a week but i smoked less i was never a daytime wake and bake kind of guy anyway. id do it occasionally but always felt a bit dirty being stoned and still having the day ahead of me. i guess i always had some kind of standard about what my lifestyle ought to be. still i was getting older mid to late twenties at this point and still wasting my time after work and not really making any life progress. id sleep in late play video games watch movies. my girlfriend was the opposite. the inevitable happened i moved into a place on my own. it was a dark time and weed came back to comfort me. i decided to go self employed at the time too. let me tell you weed and depression do not make a good combination if you gotta be switched on enough to start a business. it was the worst most shameful period of my life. so after a few more years of being at rock bottom in every aspect of my life seeing how my friends had transformed over the years from outgoing guys to introverted stoners they still are to some degree. one of them now lives with me and his weed use is at an all time high my mindset began to change and i started thinking seriously about how to get my shit together. at this point ill offer you what i believe to be an important piece of advice quitting weed will not solve your problems. but it will remove the obstacle thats blocking your chances of solving them. you land on the beaches of normandy and start strutting around like the job is done youre gonna get mown down. you gotta keep moving forward if youre gonna win the war. ill also say this i dont believe i was addicted to weed. i was addicted to the short term dopamine rush id get when i finally sat down to smoke and enjoy short term shitty rewards in the form of youtube videos porn junk food etc. try rolling a joint and then just not smoking it for a while. its not so hard because you know its there whenever you want to light it up. smoking that joint its wonderful. as soon as its finished boring. oh well better roll another. its not being stoned thats fun its getting stoned not counting the early days when you start smoking weed. in fact if youre reading this youre probably at that point where being stoned makes you feel like shit every night as you try to mask the state of your situation. so no i dont believe i was addicted to weed. i was addicted to that life of short term dopamine and zero effort which leads me to what i consider the secret to quitting weed and to a better life than your current one discipline. the way to stop smoking is to not smoke. the way i did that is via not being soft and going right back to smoking the minute it started getting hard. if i really wanted to quit and better my situation then thats what i had to do no two ways about it. nothing worth doing is easy. the hard times will last a week or two nothing in the grand scheme of things. but it might feel like everything at the time because youve conditioned yourself as a stoner to avoid any kind of real effort. the weed life is the easy life the easy life is the shit life. expect sleepless nights vivid dreams nightmares a feeling called boredom you might not have felt for some time. the feeling of having nothing to do. except thats is not true. start using that feeling to do something else. get up sort your paperwork tidy your house do the dishes brush your teeth start a project pick up a project you left hanging start some tutorials on something. these amazing feats of productivity are what regular people call real life something i had been numbing myself to all this time while i polluted my brain with weed. and the more you do these tasks the more they become normal. so you start picking up new ones bit by bit. they snowball. im sure you might find it easy to play an rpg start a character from nothing grind along the way keep levelling up completing repetitive quests for that sweet reward getting better and more powerful along the way as humans thats what we do to make us happy but you gotta apply it to your own life. one of my favourite motivational guys david goggins calls it callusing the mind. the more hard shit you do the stronger your mind becomes and the easier those things become. back then i was soft. i had to become hard. as humans were supposed to do shit. we do a task to some degree of difficulty we complete that task we feel good about it. the harder the task the bigger the reward when its complete. you even get a reward for pursuing the task in the first place and actively making progress. its keeping on top of these tasks and objectives following some form of path that gives us a feeling that some might call happiness. but back to the weed. i was not doing shit until it was gone. its a plant. i was destroying my life by smoking a plant. it had to stop. you can make quitting easier for yourself by tapering off for a while. thats exactly what i did. i smoked one joint a night for around a few weeks before my most recent attempt to quit. and id smoke it right before bed. id get all my shit done using discipline reward myself with the joint. but a joint every night is still weed every night which meant weed in my system holding me back so it had to go. i stopped smoking one year ago today and ive never looked back. i dont miss it at all. i live with a stoner my friends are stoners. the phrase high on life always seemed like bullshit to me but its accurate. there was a time when watching a movie without weed would have seemed so boring so vanilla but i dont notice it now. ever watched a film baked felt like you were completely immersed then barely remember watching it the next day im 100 dialled in to everything via a combination of zero weed and effort to keep the plates that are my life spinning. and im far from a success by the way. but i get out of bed with no grogginess i arrive to work early i brush my teeth every night without fail i pay my bills early i add totick things off of my google keep to do list every night i work out 3 days a week right after work i sit at my computer after work and build my skillset i tick that off my loop habit tracker app every day along with dont smoke weed that i added on there exactly a year ago today. i keep on top of household tasks i dont nap anymore i sleep about 8 hours a night of real good quality sleep with real dreams i wake up early even on my days off. i look and feel better than i have for years. im responsible and im organised. ive just sat down and typed this out a few days before i posted it as it was on my to do list and i wanted to have it typed up ready for today. anyway it wont be easy but nothing worth doing is. the weed life is the easy life the easy life is the shit life. stay hard as my man goggins would say.,joy
i am definitely addicted and i am quitting right now ive only have a few 2 week breaks since i started smoking 10 years ago. im 26. that in itself is crazy i always rationalize even though i know it makes me anxious lazy unable to communicate a worse version of myself. i now realize thats my addict brain. i use weed for everything. always tuning out always procrastinating my brain is now dependent on it and it shows with my moods and my harmful behaviors and sleep patterns. i dont want to accept the mediocre version of myself that weed perpetuates. i want to be clear headed. i want to heal the pain ive been avoiding since i started smoking. i have to be confident and present to do that two things that weed doesnt allow for. i smoked this morning before the gymbc ive paired weed with everything and normally i would smoke the rest of the day since i already startedtell myself to start sobriety tomorrow then never start not today i am going to run it out and stay sober. that was my last smoke yall. is this also the place to vent about withdrawal bc i fear i have a gnarly few weeks of feelings coming.,joy
one of the reasons rleaves is so great is because were not all going completely crazy on the same day. if youre having a day that is not driving you crazy or may be looking up be sure to come by and care for the people who arent. i think im repurposing a stupid thing i saw on facebook but its true every day on rleaves i see people in crisis being helped by people not in crisis and then a day or a week or a month later the roles are reversed and the person who was in crisis is helping someone else. love all you guys and how much you give back in exchange for your own sobriety.,joy
found a nugget of weed i just moved to a new house with my lady. i was looking for the charger to my cordless drill yay household chores and at the bottom of a box of junk i found a small nugget of weed. i held that nug. i stared at it. i thought about hiding it so that when my lady was at work today i could smoke it when i was alone. i sized it up. i thought about just how high id get from that much weed. how many hits it would break down to. four maybe even five if i took small ones. i smelled it. i looked for hiding places. i felt terrible. i saw a glimpse of my former self. i went to the kitchen sink. i crushed up the nug and smelled the herb and dammit i missed it. i tossed it in the sink turned on the water and watched it go away. washed the smell off my hands and went on about my chores. the streak remains. stay strong out there.,sadness
seven month checkin i do not think about it at all anymore i do not think about weed when i wake up in the morning when i used to wake and bake i do not think about weed when i talk to my stoner friends i do not think about weed at the end of the work day when i used to be itching to close out and go get stoned i do not think about weed when im upset i do not think about weed at night after the kids are in bed pretty much the only time i think about it is when i read posts on rleaves and i do not mind because when im supporting other folks herei feel free,joy
day 1 of quitting weed. flushed a bag of 10g i just bough yesterday. i cant sleep now and i feel sad i really want to quit weed. it affects you in a way you only see when you quit and are sober. ive always felt i had more energy and i was more myself and clear headed whenever i tried to quit before. this time is the right one i quit cigarettes after being a heavy smoker for 9 year this friday it will be my fourth week nicotine free. now its weeds turn i dont want to be a pot head anymore or constantly high. i want to enjoy stuff without thinking that i have to light up first. fuck weed it gets you addicted without you even realizing it and its so hard to quit you guys and this sub are helping me a lot i hope i will make it,sadness
just hit a year of being substance free from everything alcohol included. i just hit a year of being completely sober from everything. i feel good but unfortunately i really just have the urge to order a volcano from storz and bickel and vape more than ever now especially with how boring it has been during this whole covid situation. ive been making the most of my days been working out frequently reading a bit making money investing and getting straight as in all my online classes. yet the monotony of life without being able to occasionally get a substance buzz and escape from dull witted reality seems depressing and vainly pointless. anyone else at this point who is feeling similar or has any advice i know how slippery of a slope it can be going back. as ive quit and went back many times in my life but this is the longest ive ever made it and the fact that i went balls to the wall and took drinking out fully too made it that much more challenging although ive never had a problem or addictive personality at all with drinking. i know im strong enough to continue on this journey but i feel it to be pointless if i cant still learn to truly enjoy life along the way and celebrate all the hard work ive put in. ive saved a lot of money taken care of my body and am blessed to have a great group of core friends and family around me yet i just want to be able to enjoy a smoke session and a few drinks here and there. at this point im just rambling lol but all adviceperspective would be much appreciated. much love to all of you✌️🙏,joy
53 days clean one of the hardest things i have done so far but one of the best please if youre thinking of quitting you can do it ♥️♥️♥️,joy
i relapsed last night after 476 days last night i smoked and it was an overall beneficial experience for me. nbsp id been sober for 1 year and 3 months and hadhave been feeling confident in my ability to abstain since the winter holidays. my life has changed drastically since i got sober dream job moved states and most importantly ive recently begun to enjoy life without the use of intoxicants. when i first quit i thought id never have fun again and that certainly seemed true for the first 6 months but as time went on thats disproved itself over and over again. being sober has given me the opportunity to address the root causes of my substance use marijuana has always been my drug of choice but in the past it did not matter what i was putting into my body as long as i felt inebriated ive made lots of progress on my depression and suicidal tendencies and have gotten close to ridding myself of a previously crippling anxiety with the help of prescribed medications and cognitive behavioral therapy. life still is not perfect it never will be but 5 67 days of the week i feel damn good. nbsp yesterday i drove a couple hours to visit an old friend a brother somebody whod id lived with and used with and the only person whose ever known me better than i know myself. hes still self medicating with drugs in a very unhealthy way and i knew going in id be around plenty of weed. in the past 4 months ive started going to parties again and surprisingly having a great time regardless of being the only sober person and surrounded by intoxicants so i was not worried about losing control of myself. and i didnt. nbsp we had a great afternoon walked to the beach longboarded had the deep meaningful talks only two people who are on the same wavelength can. he was high the whole time i was sober but it felt just like the old times except less depressing. when we settled in that night to get lost in the weird depths of youtube i had an idea. i knew i could have a perfectly fun time with him sober but i wanted to try smoking again an experiment. at the very worst id be starting from day 1 again and have a month or so of strong cravings and at best id learn i could smoke recreationally. i was torn between trying the experiment or not i thought it might be useful but the thought of starting at day 1 again was painful. i decided to flip a coin heads i smoke tails i dont. the coin landed on heads. nbsp so i smoked. nbsp to my complete surprise it wasmeh. i had built up what being high felt like in my head so much during my sobriety that the real thing just could not even come close to living up to it. at the end of the night while falling asleep i had the biggest shock of all i regretted smoking. not because i felt guilty for relapsing or because i was worried id sent my self back down the spiral of abuse but because i would have had more fun if id stayed sober. i disliked how cloudy i felt how my anxiety got worse and how i ate an entire bag of cereal dry. i disliked losing my train of thought not being able to hold up a meaningful conversation and the god damn cotton mouth. i disliked feeling sluggish lazy and like id be fine with never leaving the couch again. i disliked being high. nbsp what a marvelous revelation. i went from feeling like i was missing out by not partaking to now being truly grateful that im not. i woke up this morning with no urge to smoke again. nbsp this is truly the best outcome one that i had not even considered.,joy
my favourite quote about weed the best thing ive ever heard about weed comes from an episode of south park back in season 6 i believe where randy is finally honest with stan about the dangers of smoking pot after using lies and manipulation to scare him away from it the whole episode. he says something along the lines of look pot wo not kill you or turn you into some kind of monster but the truth is it makes you feel ok with being bored. and its when youre bored when you should be learning a new skill or bettering yourself in some way. its always really stuck with me hes absolutely right. for the last two years of my life i spent high i was just bored all the time and fine with it and thats no way to live a life. six weeks sober now and really enjoying finally beginning to feel like a real person again,joy
were awesome it does not matter where you are maybe you are in the early stages and contemplating maybe you just got through the first 24 hours 30 days or 300 days it does not matter. perhaps youve smoked for 1 year or ten. you should all give yourselves a pat on the back for acknowledging and accepting that you need to make a change and doing something about it. for many participating in a group like this will be the extra boost they need. there are so many who never get to this point to try to help themselves. you are awesome because you have the wherewithal to make a change and you are trying. even if you think you have failed youre still here reading this and that means you have not because you are still trying. keep up the good work everyone.,joy
weed the sleep killer weed is bad for your sleep. sure maybe you get more hours of sleep but the sleep is less restful this has been well documented in multiple studies. also do you think not dreaming could possibly be good for you there is a reason we dream and weed inhibits the dreams. i think dreaming and deep sleep has a lot to do with memory storage and function and this is why chronic smokers have memory and recall problems. cant remember the name of that band forgot you had to do that thing ditch the weed and dream again get a solid nights rest and be ready for the day. stop interrupting the nature of nature. we are primordial perfection perfect as is a magical robot. weed is like mud on a white wedding cake.,joy
the problem wasnt so much weed it was me this was being discussed at a meeting i went to. yes i know i cant do it anymore. there is no way i can get into weed again and have it be ok. just no way. and thats scary to accept. but i have to if i care about myself. and i do care about myself. however i realize as time goes by that it wasnt weed it was me. because even after being weed free for 6 months i still have a lot of the same problems in other words i am still me. just a less crazy fucked up version. the immediate problems are gone but i feel the long term ones stewing beneath the surface still. maybe they will always be there. maybe i need to talk about them more so they are less threatening. i had to get weed out of the way so i at least have a chance to change my longtime issues of isolation low self confidence anxiety procrastination indecisiveness anger depression and resentment. to name a few. my weed addiction wasnt the root of the problem it was the sign of how bad things had finally become inside.,anger
one is too much a thousand is not enough i was always chasing the dragon always wanting just one more jointcone to calm my nervous system. and when i finally was calm i was usually too stoned to be productive. forced to stay alone in my apartment watching tv and forgetting everything i just watched. turning down 90 of the offers i had to go out and do something enjoyable. and whenever i did go out i desperately tried to act like i was sober. what a stupid way to live. i quit many times only to say to myself i can have a smoke tonight ive been good and that one was always too much i always felt worse afterwards. i never enjoyed it like i thought i would. and then came the chaser effect i needed an endless amount of weed after that first hit in order to feel better craving the next joint before the current one was even finished. these days im enjoying my sobriety more than ever and for one main reason. ive reinterpreted my cravings as nervous agitation instead of saying i need a joint now i say i need some restmeditationbetter sleepfood exercise etc whatever it happens to be in that moment that my body is asking for. the point is i listen to my body now and have developed many ways to keep it happy instead of just shutting it up with another blaze. if my only tool is a hammer then every problem is a nail. scholem asch,joy
the temporary euphoric high you get from weed is seriously not worth it for how it make you feel throughout the next day ive started to liken it to stimulants from back in the day. yes ecstasy was nice at the time but the next day and beyond made me feel like shit. weed does the same after smoking the night before no motivation low mood indecision etc. stay strong people. do not give up on giving up it really isnt worth it. think how much better you feel waking up with a clearer mind as each day passes. nearly one month clean now and im fully done with giving mary jane my energy.,joy
240 days in and smoked twice yesterday just making this post as an accountability post for myself. i work as a tax preparer so it was my first day off since january 20th. i got a little excited and ended up taking two hits from my friends joint in the afternoon and at night a bong hit. im writing this because although i smoked twice yesterday im not gonna be too hard on myself and just keep it going. i know that i should not keep on smoking and to be honest it was not anything special anyway. im glad that i am not a stoner anymore smoking every day,joy
not smoking weed feels so fucking great 7 year daily toker here. i smoked because i was tired and needed to rest tonight. i felt more tired the next day. i smoked because i felt depressed. i was still down and foggy the next morning. i smoked because i was bored. then i was just bored and high. i smoked because i was taking today off and ill be even more productive tomorrow then i just wanted to take the next day off too. i used to do things i used to read books and play music and go on adventures. and then i started doing those things while high and wow it was so much fun. and then smoking weed became the activity instead of being part of the activity. and then i just smoked weed. and then i was just boring and high. i have used the herb to escape many things in the last seven years. im in professional school. im in great shape and have a sexy girlfriend. i have all the things most people cite when needing reasons to quit and get their shit together. but i am capable of even more everyone is capable of more. i have not had a healthy relationship with cannabis for a long time. i am on day five and not smoking is just fucking great. i am proud of myself every minute that i choose to do something other than smoking weed. i did lsd and mushrooms a couple of times during college in the name of psychedelic exploration some of my best realizations about life and my place in it came from those trips. i remember being so damn uncomfortable at times on acid and i remember the glorious triumphant comedown on the back end of a trip. i remember thinking i had overcome something and i was always beautifully aware and mindful and focused in the days after the trip. i decided to treat the first few days of sobriety like a trip. i embraced being uncomfortable. i embraced sitting on my couch sweaty and unable to sleep on the first night. i embraced the unpleasant disruption of my nightly ritual. i was present with myself and for the first time in months i actually felt what i was feeling. it was not pleasant but it was real. and it was so much better than just getting high. change is a natural part of life. do not be afraid to change. do not be afraid to be a better version of yourself. do not be afraid to be present within your own life if you spend it numb and stoned it could slip you by.,joy
500 days sober found a dab cart in a vent so a while ago i vacuumed out all of vents cause thats the kind of stuff you do when youre sober rather than smoking all your money up. i left one dirty because its under this big book shelf with lots of breakables on it and was also just tired of cleaning. i was burning incense and dropped my lighter down there didnt see it put my phone flash light on it and what do you know a full dab cart perhaps from me or the girl who lived here before me as she was a huge stoner who actually sold me carts and fake carts all the time and lots of christmas tree needles as in 2017 she had her christmas tree above that very spot i have been struggling with sobriety in quarantine particularly with weed because its not that bad right if i was still smoking i would have immediately moved the book shelf probably broke a few things lifted up the grates put the filthy cart into my pen and see if it still hit sober me just went back to being sad and bored and lonely without making my life 10000 times worse by breaking my sobriety to get stoned alone off of what is probably almost a 3 year old dab pen lol,sadness
havent dabbled with the jazz cabbage in over a month for the first time since my junior year of high school my mind feels clear and ive been getting so much done lately i feel so much better about life in general and ive picked up a lot of healthy habits. i hope everyone is having a good day and i wish u all success on this path ❤️ love john,joy
3 year secret ive never told anyone in my life that i smoked weed everyday. it has made my life worse and ive felt nothing but embarrassment and weakness. days and nights are structured around when i can get high. i feel like i have to be high before anything i do but im not even happy when im high im just not sad. today was my first sober day in a long time im proud of myself and i wanted somewhere to share that. this post is more of a confession than anything and im hoping it will make the process of quitting more real.,joy
weed and depression lying to yourself this post is about my experiences with a deep and dark depression and my abuse of cannabis which only exacerbated the issue. to start off i will give some background to my issues with depression. i grew up in an abusive household. my first experiences with it came before birth as ive heard stories of my father beating my mother while she was in the late stages of being pregnant with me. black eyes and cut faces were not an uncommon sight in my household. on the night of my 11th birthday my mom couldnt take it anymore and i watched as she attempted suicide in my kitchen. after that night my parents were divorced. the divorce was tough on me and the first time id attempted suicide i was 11 12. i remember praying to god asking him to take me to heaven as early as 6 years old. i went through most of my life horribly depressed and didnt realize it until highschool. this is where weed came on the scene. my sophomore year i smoked for the first time and felt really good. i remember equating the feeling to when youre walking barefoot on hot sand on the beach and then you touch the water of the beach and instantly feel that cooling sensation. weed and me were a match made in heaven. i spent the next three years smoking everyday and doing relatively well in life. i was a captain on my football team and a top 10 hurdler in san diego county. i also had a relatively high gpa. i graduated highschool and this is where it all came crashing down. my first year spent in the real world was a wake up call because i could no longer use my highschool achievements as a crutch since they no longer mattered. to make matters worse i had lost my motivation for sports and quit my collegiate football team. i truly blame this on my weed abuse. this is where my depression caught up with me. i could not get out of bed when i had free time for the life of me. i would get home and immediately just collapse on my floor and dream of killing my self. the only thing that got me out of the house was to smoke weed. i would feel good then but the entire day before that point would be consumed in suicidal thoughts. i lied to myself so much about my weed abuse saying that it was helping my depression when in reality it only made it worse. i only felt good when i smoked and the rest of the day was a pit of despair. oh may 24th of this year i had worked up enough steam and decided that was going to be the night i killed myself. only when it came time to do it i pussied out. thank god i did. 4 days later i got a call with a job offer in wyoming. i accepted with no second thoughts and have been here the last 2 and 12 months. in that time i have not smoked. my depression has slowly reversed. i attribute it to my sobriety and this new feeling of moving forward with my life. each day gets easier. i still long for weed and want to smoke so badly. not sure if that will ever go away. my belief is that my brains reward system is slowly being reset to normal levels. i feel good when i accomplish something or learn something new. this is what gets me out the door whenever i have free time to do hikes or adventure. i never used to care about these things because my mind was set on snapping a big old bowl that evening. tldrthe point of my story weed fucking bodies your desire to experience new things. being uncomfortable is good because it often implies growth. you will not grow in the hazy comfort of beautiful bud. weed should not be considered a medicine for depression because it only makes you comfortable in the circumstances which caused the depression in the first place. you train yourself to be content with something which your spirit despises. depression anxiety and anger are the mechanisms your spirit uses to tell your conscious mind to fucking change something. if you shut your spirit up by sedating it your spirit is still dying but you no longer have the motivation to change the pattern.,joy
30 years stoned 72 days sober reality check thoughts and aspirations. i will never be able to moderate my weed consumption because i am an addict. i will never again believe the lies that mary jane told me when i was a user. i will enjoy my sobriety everyday even when days are difficult because life is not always kind. i will aspire to be a giver. a giver of love strength and encouragement. i will cultivate my being by first pulling out the weeds of despair and planting kindness in their place. i will enjoy the discoveries i have not yet discovered. i will no longer escape fear by escaping and getting stoned. i will confront it and learn what fear has to teach me. i will not let a bad day in the past ruin my future. i will always remember that no matter how difficult life seems there is always something i can be successful doing. obligatory gilding edit thank you kind redditor. poster edit poster of this,joy
just because you have a long sobriety spree doesnt mean you can smoke again and control it. my warning. im a 23 year old guy from canada. i first tried the devils lettuce when i was just 13 years old. from than on out i had always had an unhealthy relationship with weed. it took over my life for 7.5 years untill i finally had enough and quit. july 1st wouldve been my 3 year sobriety but i relapsed back in december. after 2.5 years of sobriety for 2 and a half years i was clean 2 and a half years and than this christmas i thought hey you know what i can have a little puff why not and i tried it. nope. i tried to justify it in my mind like oh now ive got my career started ive finished school ive basically cured my depression and anxiety i wont use weed as a crutch this time around because now im in control of my life. i had one bong rip. one. and 2 days later i bought a half ounce of kush a bong and a grinder. 2 months after that i was already onto extracts. i started with only smoking on the weekends ya okay hemphead and at its peak i was dabbing 3 4 times a day. every. day. guess what my anxietys back my depression is deffenitly back and now my irritable bowel syndrome is back as well. why whyd i throw it all away because thats addiction. my brain was still against me. it still after all this time manipulated me into thinking i was okay to smoke. im not. and i never will be. round two begins now and i know it wont be hard this time because now i know the truth. im just one of those people that cant smoke weed. july 5th 2018 was the last time i got stoned.,anger
94 on first engineering midterm this semester average was a 77 too so im pumped. wouldve cheated my way through if i were still smoking. been studying 12 hours a day for the last week and im not even getting tired. this sub literally saved me so thank you everyone. and screw mary jane.,joy
how come we only know that smoking weed is bad while smoking weed lol,anger
20 reasons why i want to quit smoking weed 1. groggy mornings 2. often tired 3. i second guess my sober self my real self when i get high 4. recurring negative thought patterns 5. bad memory 6. always craving something 7. anxiety when not high 8. big distractor from goals and dreams 9. dulls the senses emotions 10. less emotional maturity runaway from problems mentality 11. slower reaction time 12. loss of wide range of vocabulary 13. ill do it tomorrow mentality 14. uncertainty of my true feelings 15. gateway to other addictions 16. no energy to do mentally difficult tasks or tiring tasks 17. easily more irritable when doing meticulous tasks. i think screw this i just want to be high 18. pot is for the people who want to distract themselves from the difficulty of reality 19. wasting time sitting around lazy anti social 20. causes daydream about a different better life that leave me stuck ive been getting high for about 8 years and i realize how strongly its affected me living the life of my dreams. in fact ive realized that getting high has been a distraction used as a tool to make myself feel better for not following my passions and what my spirit is telling me. im on the spectrum of one or the other. especially when im home alone getting high often. do not get me wrong weed has many beautiful benefits. but when it becomes an escape from what im really feeling it causes suffering. weed has always been there for me when i have not been there for myself. when ive neglected my feelings my energies my passions. i turn to weed to make me feel better. so thank you weed for what youve done so far. but i can handle the rest without you. add me on insta gunnlukari lets be friends,sadness
one year ago i made a conscious decision to change my life,joy
smoking weed is like hitting the snooze button on life,anger
smoked more last joints than some ever have. hey there guys first post here and generally more of a lurker on reddit but i figured ill share some stuff here because its quite important for me and my journey of quitting. so im living in germany 20 years old and have been smoking for close to 6 years way too long to begin with. since my 18th birthday ive probably smoked close to everyday not huge amounts like some of you may have but at least 1 2 joints per day way more on the weekends obviouslysmoking for so long i think its just logical that almost all my friends are smoking as well which does not make any of this easier. im also living in an area where weed in general is just really popular and easily accessible which stems from the fact that we are really close to the netherlands. i think most of you can relate to the good ole days somehow getting your weed after getting send from number to number sneaking through the neighbourhood looking for a secret smoking spot then sneaking in high as fuck and having the time of your life laughing your asses off over hilarious convos and videos. but somehow someway these times started to fade the more you smoked the more regular it got the more it went from this really fun high to a quite boring couchlocky demotivating high. binging some stupid tv shows not remembering half of it playing video games spaced out af just kinda vegetating together in your room. while others went out with their friends doing fun activities going to the bars not saying that alcohol is better but you get what i mean you were just living life on standby. and weed kinda told me that it was ok. it never really occured to me just how much time i was wasting day to day night to night doing something but not really doing anything at all. i guess some of you can relate. somewhere around last year my highs have also become quite uncomfortable with racing thoughts almost everytime and not really enjoying the high anymore at all. it happened really often but i still continued because the good old highs will come again for sure. but no weed started giving me really bad panic attacks most of the time which maybe started because my life did not fall apart per se but it just did not go the way i wanted it to. school was not going as well as it should have me and my gf of 2.5 years broke up and in general i just became kind of a sad person deep down even if it did not seem so to most other people i was pretty good at masking it. to this day i do not know if i really had some kind of depression but i just wanted to numb everything out with weed which did not work anymore because of those panic attacks. a few months ago i stumbled across this subreddit in a rtrees comment section and scrolled through here for a bit but i was still convinced that all of my problems did not have anything to do with weed which i know not all of them do but most of them. more to that later. also a few months ago i found the instagram page of a girl that really sparked my interest she literally looks like the girl of my dreams i could not create a more beautiful girl for me even if god gave me the tools to do so she also lives in the town right next to mine. i said fuck it send her a message and she actually answered even though she is in my eyes way out of my league. we were messaging on and off and a few weeks later we arranged a date. at this time i was still smoking daily. the day came we met and i was nervous as fuck probably the most nervous ive ever been more nervous than before my a levels or aynthing like that. weed also made my social anxiety and awkwardness worse which didnt help at all.the date went okay but after she messaged me and told me that i was just not really conversative not really talking much myself just answering to stuff that she said and generally not really coming up with topics myself. that shit hit me hard i used to be a really witty talker not to tap my own shoulder or anything but i used to be a good talker. hearing this from her kinda opened my eyes i didnt even notice how much weed had affected my ability to socialice with other people how much it affected my life in generaly how little i was actually doing in life that i have so little interesting stuff to talk about. it kinda crushed me but we still continued messaging and all that but not much anymore. now last sunday was the day i decided it was time to quit for good my lungs were getting fucked up i felt foggy all the time you know what im talking about. this wednesday i then messaged her again asking if we might meet up again and luckily she agreed for this friday yesterday. again i was nervous but not close to as nervous as i was the time before. and what should i say it went great. my socials skills were back after almost a week i could hold a conversation and eye contact come up with topics ask interesting questions about stuff she talked about and generally engage so much more in the conversation. she told me she had a great time and it seems like well be meeting up more often now and i could not be happier its encouraging me even more to stay off of weed the best motivation i could probably have getting the girl of my dreams. sorry for the wall of text guys but i just needed to get all of this off my chest have a great day and stay strong guys and wish me luck p also sorry for some wonky grammar or anything been a while since i wrote an english text,joy
thought about relapsing today but went to a behavioral therapy class instead,sadness
i was not missing anything boyfriend and i decided to break our almost 2.5 month streak of sobriety. wed both been missing it and were curious if our habits had changed ie could we moderate. ive felt like a zombie for the past few days. no energy no focus no drive. my lungs hurt my mouth is dry and ive got a wicked headache. if anything this has served as a great reminder of why i gave it up in the first place. i was not missing anything. im done with it. totally done.,sadness
i didnt smoke weed today i was in an old and comfortable situation where i wouldve smoked my face off 100 a couple weeks ago. i didnt. feels good man. ✌️,joy
one day at a time the small reminders make the biggest difference for me,joy
been a while since my last post 4 years since i started to turn my life around today got a notification from my quitting app today which informed me that it has been 1460 days since my last toke. this was after 11 years of almost daily abuse and the total annihilation of my personal growth and development. it feels better than ever to be free and im so glad to finally have a grasp of who i really am. to anyone that is struggling with breaking the habit let me assure you that it does get better and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. the rewards will come they may not be immediate but they will come eventually. stay strong everybody and know that you are in the right place this community is amazing and i could not have done it without you x edit someone asked me how long it took for me to start feeling a difference within myself. some people seemed to find my answer helpful so i thought id include it here theres no real easy or simple answer to that question. i guess when i started consistently replacing weed with other activities that were better for me and formed new habits based around those activities when i actively sought and found joy in other aspects of my life basically. but even thats just a tiny part of it. one big misconception i often encounter on this sub is the idea that by simply removing the weed from your life your problems will vanish on their own. in my personal experience that has simply not been the case. what i will say however is that quitting weed gave me the tools to tackle those problems whereas daily weed use just masked them and ultimately kept me mired in the same place. i wo not lie it has been a long and slow journey towards self improvement and it is one that continues to this day. but one thing i do know for sure is that i am in a much better place now than i ever have been before. i can only speak for myself but i smoked basically every day from the age of 14 to 25. i had absolutely zero sense of who i was supposed to be as an adult as my entire development had been framed through the haze of smoking weed. in other words it touched every experience that i had which meant i did not have a genuine sense of what those experiences actually meant to me or how they should have informed my sense of self. removing weed from my life was merely the first step in figuring out who i really was but this is not something that happens passively it is a process that has to be engaged with on an active level. to put it simply i had to completely rebuild myself from the ground up and that process took a lot longer than a month or 6 months or even a year to start having any real effect. when you are quitting any drug you are effectively replacing instant gratification with a more slow release reward system which is why it can be so hard to quit and so hard to readjust once you have quit. drugs are instantly satisfying in the moment life is not. but i had to trust that i was making the right decision by quitting and if i still was not happy i had to look at what other aspects of my life needed changing and find the motivation to do something about it which again is a lot easier without weed. like i said the rewards were not instant but they were there and they are absolutely worth seeking out.,joy
one year weed free today i smoked weed daily for about 4 years from 21 to 25 years old and smoked frequently with friends for 5ish years before that. at this date last year i was in the hospital hooked on an iv after a week straight of not being able to eat or drink anything. as soon as i got to the hospital and told the triage nurse what symptoms i had she asked me if i smoked weed frequently to which i said yes. i got sent into the back on a bed straight away and after a while a doctor came and told me i was very likely suffering from cannabinoid hyperhemesis syndrome. i had read a little bit about it before but ive had issues with digestion and vomiting which i take meds for for a long time before i started smoking weed regularly so never thought the 5 6 times i was sick every month were due to the fact i was smoking too much marijuana then the doctor told me the only real way for the constant nausea not being able to eat and vomiting to cease was to stop smoking weed. i havent smoked since. i was so sick all the time i just couldnt take it anymore and the fact that the answer to my problems was so easy made me stop smoking right there without looking back. i cant say i didnt miss weed at all during the past year. i did. i missed it a lot at first because it was such a habit for me and it was kind of like a safe place. i had to relearn how to do everything sober like watching tv shows drawing sleeping and eating. it was really hard at first and i felt like shit and i wanted to smoke so bad sometimes but on the other hand i could eat everything and not risk throwing it up after a few hours or the next morning and that was the thing that trumped every other insidious weed smoking thoughts i had. i am also fortunate enough to have a very supportive girlfriend who helped me through the process. she also on my request took my weed box and hid it somewhere in the house. i havent tried to search for it once and i am pretty proud of that. overall im really happy that i stopped smoking. i didnt want to see that i smoked a lot and that i used weed to hide from my problems. i am also much more healthy now ive gained weight but at least its because i can eat all the things and not throw up every other morning ahaha and i think about weed way less. im still nostalgic of the times i spent high with my friends and what fun we had but im still able to have as much fun with them sober. im also happy that i dream every night now it makes sleep that much more interesting and im not ever paranoid that people will know im high anymore because im never high anymore ahaha. i feel like im rambling so ill end this here this is so long im so sorry but im really glad for this community. im just a lurker but it helped me to see other peoples experiences with quitting weed and it greatly helped me to see that recovery is not linear and that having setbacks is okay. i wish everyone here the best and to have a great day,joy
two days sober going on hour 50 of no weed. i know its not that impressive but ive spent the last few years getting high everyday usually all day. ive been subbed here for over a year and finally decided that i cant continue at this rate. all of the posts here are so inspiring and im proud to be apart of this amazing community,joy
hi leaves in 3 days will be my 11 months weed free and today is my 74th day without alcohol its weird its been so long that today i went to my friends birthday and they were all like remember last year and i was like i do i guess i quit the next month but thats indication that a whole year had passed somehow hahaha i turned down a joint twice actually and didnt drink a drop although i dont actually have a drinking problem but quit for personal reasons much love,surprise
i have hobbies again celebrating 3mo. sober i didnt fully realize how much time i wasted getting baked and doing nothing. like randy on south park said smoking weed makes you fine with being bored. i forgot how much i enjoy making things with my hands. ive rekindled and furthered my love for metalsmithing and woodworking. past couple weeks ive been spending my evenings in the garage having a great time making stuff—little robot figurine mini tank for my fiancé and more. and i cant believe how much more productive i am at work tonight my fiancé and i are going to get some ice cream to celebrate his raise at work and my three months sober. life is good.,joy
im now 6 months clean. to the lurkers and the strugglers. you really can do it. youve lived life without weed before and you can definitely do it again. something that helped me is remembering that even if im smoking or not time goes by at the same rate. 2 weeks from now do i want to be proud of myself or be disappointed in myself for smoking you have the willpower but youre too afraid to accept reality without it. you have the ability but not the drive. you have a goal in mind but not the strength to make it. you think this way but you have all of these things challenge yourself. learn from yourself and remember your not alone. you can do it. i love and believe in all of you.,joy
i have to face reality now. i am 40 plus days sober and now have nothing to mask my feelings past and reality. my brain is on overdrive. i ca not seem to accept myself this way. i want to smoke but i do not at the same time. facing my real life is almost disturbing to me. but i have to try. i just dont know a lot of who i am. now i have to figure it out. just venting.,sadness
sober is the new high every time i get a craving to get stoned i tell myself you will hate that feeling after the first hit. it aint worth it being sober and clear is the new high after 10 years of having my system flooded with thc. i told myself do it socially with friends here and there fuck that i dont even want it in my system. rather be alone and present in my mind and life not numbed out. i feel like im missing out if i bury weed but we all gotta grow up i wouldnt want my kids becoming potheads if i had kids so why should i keep pumping myself with poison. its literally awful for mental health but everyone thinks its medicine and goodforyou. what an oxymoron lol.,sadness
i wish i could smoke weed every night and not have to worry about the side effects. weed is so great but at the same time it sucks.,joy
recently hit 3 months clean. here are some improvements ive noticed. i wrote this as a reply to another thread but thought it might be worth posting in case it helps anyone stay motivated. i know the first month can be tough but i promise things get better 1. clear thoughts and better short term memory 2. much better sleep quality 3. im more self disciplined and motivated 4. anxiety is pretty much completely gone and can no longer constantly feel my heart pounding 5. much happier in general 6. more social and less awkwardly self conscious 7. proud of myself every day 8. started new hobbies and routines that i would have never done while i was a stoner 9. i enjoy films and tv shows more 10. reading is easier and more enjoyable 11. my diet has improved 12. ive saved lots of money that otherwise would have been wasted on getting high 13. i no longer have the constant underlying guilty feeling of doing something i know is not good for me 14. my lungs and overall health feels amazing 15. not having to visit dealers every few days 16. not having that constant nagging feeling of a depleting stash 17. appreciating small things in life that seemed meaningless when i was high all the time 18. creativity comes to me more naturally 19. more productive at work and not constantly clock watching thinking about when i can next smoke which actually makes the day go quicker 20. i feel much more present and mindful,joy
nearly 4 years clean as i approach this time of year i always think about when i finally made the decision to quit relying on smoking a plant every day to feel good. i think i would have fit in as your typical stoner. i smoked for 8 years daily always when hanging out in my friends garage playing music or countless hours on my pc playing video games. i thought it made these things i loved so much better. i thought anyone who did not get high and listen to the avett brothers live vol 2 was really missing out. it felt so critical to my enjoyment in life that i never imagined i would stop. one morning i woke up and in a total light bulb moment i decided i was not going to smoke. i did not need it today. i dont know what made me do the next step but i packed up my stuff and ran to drop it in my trash can literally as the garbage truck was 2 houses away. i felt a sudden calmness and of course some panic as that trash bin dumped into the truck. still standing in the driveway the next thing i did was delete all my dudeman phone numbers from my phone and thus started a new life. i decided to try some new things escape my comfort zone and just a few weeks after i quit i met someone exciting. since then ive gotten married bought a house got a few promotions and now have a beautiful daughter. i love all of my hobbies even more than i did when i was smoking. i am more focused and have a clearer mindset on life and the person i want to be. i quit simply because it was not as fun as it used to be. i outgrew it. something we all eventually do. the choice is yours in the end on when its time to move on. good luck to all of you out there and always stay positive.,joy
ive gotten into drawing much more since i stopped smoking a few days ago. it has a weird way of stopping time similar to pot. i drew me. im proud of it.,fear
30 days todaylongest sober period in over three years. today marks 30 days since i last smoked weed. ive been a regular user for over 5 years mostly every evening as soon as i could after getting home or finishing up with work. been lurking on this sub off and on for the last two years and even posted some small successes on my previous attempts under a different account. this time i intentionally waited 30 days until posting because i did not believe i could actually do it. i have not gone this long without smoking in a very long time so i consider it a real achievement but im cautiously optimistic. at first it was very tough as with previous breaks but now i do not have many cravings just battling fatigue and more recently an intense guilt for not being able to stop sooner. it feels like my life was on auto pilot for the last five years and i was not doing things for myself but rather what others expected of me. i was a fully functional stoner because i convinced myself the bare minimum was good enough to get by in life. having this clarity again for the first time helped me realize i was never a just get by kind of person. slowly but surely my motivation and drive are coming back but definitely not 100. over the last 30 days ive continually come to this subreddit and just read posts whenever i had cravings or thought about giving up. its amazing how just reading about completely random strangers struggles that are so similar to your own can motivate you. for that i want to thank each of you for sharing and helping others. not really sure where i was going with the post but thought id share the milestone and some of my thoughts. i guess ill say keep up the good fight. keep coming here for motivation when you feel like giving up and know that theres complete strangers out there rooting for you. positive vibes edit thanks everyone for the replies im glad i can offer some words of encouragement and im super proud of you all for continuing the fight. lets hit the next big milestone together,joy
i finally got my appetite back guys. i can finally eat without throwing up. oh my god this is incredible. i never thought that i would get over it but i did. i can finally eat to anyone experiencing loss of appetite you will eat. and you will get better. meal replacement drinks saved my life. just thought id share this because im so happy. i thought i was going to die.,joy
there are a lot of hours in the day when you arent stoned. a. lot. first sober weekend. house is spotless errands are run even the cats have been brushed. i feel like an ass complaining about boredom butim doing it. eita title should be day 6 et al.,anger
i wish i never tried weed im 28 and have been smoking chronically for about 10 years. there have been so many times where ive said im going to quit or at the very least play that maybe if i just smoke once a week game in my head yet i always end up relapsing back into daily use. i have a serious lovehate relationship with weed. when im sober i wanna smoke really bad. yet when im baked i wish i had stayed sober. the weed buzz is really nice but along with it comes with a long list of downsides anxiety depression laziness fear of conflict fear of death way more anti social inability to focus on my studies munchies need more sleep lack of motivation to do shit even after the buzz wears off ive actually cut out a lot of bad habits during the covid pandemic and ive therefore been really proud of myselfmostly. ive been smoking less up until the last couple weeks im drinking less granted i wasnt a big drinker beforehand either i quit jacking off i quit caffeine and while i still eat meat ive incorporated more plant based meals into my diet. and im starting school in two weeks for my m.s. in computer science. that said i just cant see myself being as successful in school as i want to be if i dont cut weed out of my life entirely. i dont even think i can be one of those just during christmas time or just during my birthday people because then it will be the only thing i think about all year. i wish i had that kind of control but ive proven over and over and over that i dont. i dont even think i can drink because my desire to smoke increases tenfold when ive been consuming alcohol. fuck man. i wish i never tried weed.,joy
day 4. irritable and miserable but putting the anxious energy into cleaning and christmas. ive accomplished more this morning clear headed in 3 hours than i have the past 6 months combined. weed adds to the anxiety and depression for me thats the bottom line. stay strong my reddit leavers.,anger
i know this reddit is primarily for weed but yesterday i decided to stop smoking meth. some pretext is that im 21 years old first started using at 15 and this is my 3rd and shortest relapse lasting a little over a month august with as little as 26 hours of sleep across the entire month while working a 9 hour shift 6 days a week at a restaurant that often does 300 covers in one morning. i have completely and entirely drained my body of any nutrients its been clinging to and i have started to feel the most intense withdrawals the likes of which ive never experienced so harshly. i would love some kind words and support from my rleaves community. thank you all for the kind words i take them all very seriosuly and have helped me get through the work day that much more. i really needed this thank you. update 101218 42 days sober and going strong. no desire to return. thank you all.,anger
my very strange milestone🙄 today a reached 4 months 20 days sober. stopped in may 6 and my main motivation was to get that freaking brain fog out of my head and i succesfully won. in that stoned days having to think difficult things ever resulted in scapism its a pattern i see in the ones that smoke we only want to go throught the way of entertainment life isnt yet a bed of roses for me but really help to be totally aware of my situation and not numbed. also everything i try to learn my mind register. for example i started to study video edition with a very hard software called adobe premiere. in this program it is a must to remember dozens of keyboard shortcuts that makes our workflow economically viable to be a professional editor. now i ask would i be able to learn so much in less than 2 months i kept smoking absolutely no. so its being so much better to be sober even when i have cravings i remeber the slime minded i was before hugs from brazil,fear
16 years of daily smoking to day 18 of sobriety id never have believed it. its possible and you can do it. im about to finish my 18th day of sobriety from weed. im going to bed with a full stomach and im on the second chapter of a book i never read and i can even partially remember chapter one. i have smoked north of 3gs every day for 11 of those 16 years bar 2 when i was stuck in a hospital for a week i had some delivered for the remainder of my time there. 18 days ago i read the threads on rleaves and they inspired me so i want to share my experiences so far and ill be brutally honest. its the hardest thing ive ever done. it may also be the hardest mountain you ever climb but its possible and its fkg worth it. ive had two real phases so far. 1st 10 12 days of utter misery depression beyond anything ive ever experienced ive been in residential therapy before due to ptsd and this was worse. the anger and rage was unreal the lack of sleep was physically painful and i resigned from my job in a tantrum and cut off life long friendships for good. its unbearable and heartbreaking but each day i did not smoke or give in and i woke up feeling slightly more balanced. there were 48 hours when suicide was the only option i saw feasible. on these days i took diazepam drs orders over the phone and slept. perhaps i cheated but the alternative would have been worse but i did not smoke. there were other symptoms i experienced but everyone is different. phase 2 in the last week im definitely more irritable than i was when stoned but im calming more day by day. my appetite is returning and ive slept two nights for 7 hours now without it taking an age to get there. my sex drive is non existent and headaches are pretty overwhelming but my physical craving for smoke has 99 passed. finally. i still have not had one dreamnightmare though i can say that today i have seen a light. i feel like i can think more and feel more in a good way. im excited about life and my future. if id given in and smoked or hung myself id never have seen this light which im confident will help me through the rest of my recovery. as deep as it sounds it really is so real and possible that anyone wishing to quit no matter how long youve smoked can. ive got a long way to go yet and im sure therell be more phases as i progress to gaining my life back. this is new territory for me as a man and no longer someone hiding behind a joint. one thing id say helped me the most whatever you feel however dark and physically unbearable do not give in no matter the excuse. be it succumbing to sadness and smoking do not smoke and i promise itll get brighter. the first week two weeks might even even be longer for you it will get better. now its looking like ill have my job back and i can start to think of a wider plan. its a tiny step in paying back the pain caused to myself for over half of my life but its the beginning. i hope everyone going through this journey feels empowered by this community and im really excited for anyone getting their life back. you can do it. it is possible and your life will be the way you feel it should be. its just that first step to see a brighter you and cut that shit out of your existence. good luck rleaves fam im excited for everyone here and send you all the power and courage i can. youll do it. l x,sadness
im sorry at some point in the past was it a year ago maybe two i came across this sub or one like this where all participants focused on giving up weed. i scrolled through the titles thinking something in the lines of wow these people clearly cannot handle their weed. maybe it really is not for them. myself i had no intention of quitting. i knew it was slightly inconvenient to always think about having enough always chasing the high but i knew i was not like these poor souls who need to quit to feel better about their lives. people who let weed ruin them. i knew people who would become paranoid and very affected after one puff so they had to stay sober. i used to smoke bowls while hanging out with them and feel so in control of myself. i thought it was those people who end up addicted and miserable. but i was different was able to handle it well i was cool. ha ha ha. i had other interests besides weed scholarly artistic athletic pursuits and refused to believe weed was changing my ability to perform them. im sorry. my judgment even though never outwardly expressed was a real stoner thought process. recently after quitting few other habits i clinged on to smoking weed because it was a relationship for life i assumed slowly but surely it became clear the substance was stalling me impeding my growth and rhythm affecting all aforementioned interests and results thereof. putting a wall of smoke between me and people smokers and non smokers. obscuring the experiences and connections. in the emptiness caused by not being high i can catch and recognize many more thought forms flying through my consciousness and not fall into a self perpetuating ganja loop. had a puff the other day and really felt it i became like those kids who ca not handle their weed,joy
woke up feeling okay last night was really hard. i was angry and wanted to cry. i made dinner for my family and hated it no flavor despite them liking it. hubby was standing in the kitchen wrong wtf does that even mean. just a horrible night. i really wanted to give in and just be happy. i didnt though i cleaned my house played with my kid snuggle my cat. knit a sweater i started last year for my husband to celebrate our third wedding anniversary i didnt realize i could angrily knit lol im almost done with it now i couldnt fall asleep until 1am and daughter woke up at 3am because of the storm. i fell asleep on her floor while holding her hand and comforting her. despite all that i woke up feeling okay. my eyes are super funky but i made it though a rough night. thank you everyone.,joy

my day was ruined my weed yesterday my friends and i all had this extravagant day planned. as soon as i woke up i ate breakfast and headed to a friends new apartment in a major city. we were going to drink mimosas and watch college football before attending an mlb game at 7pm. around 2 oclock they convinced me to rip the bong. i used to smoke everyday for 2 years. i took some time off and eventually ended up quitting. i ripped the bong and my day was ruined. i was in a sleepydazed state until i went to sleep that night. i felt like shit at the game. even before we left for the game i was half asleep. i became lazy unaware and antisocial because of weed. this awesome day we had planned was ruined by my inability to just say no. how did i used to function off weed i probably didnt but now that im living sober i can actually realize how much it was fucking with my powerful sober mind.,joy
i just wanted to say thank you to this sub for a different reason this is one of the few places on the internet that does not preach weed as a miracle drug. all of your heart wrenching stories have stopped me as someone who recently graduated high school from falling down the rabbit hole. i know the purpose of this sub is to be a support group for those already affected but as someone who has tried weed and owned a pen for a while the stories on this sub have helped me nip it in the bud pun intended before it became a problem. thank you and keep fighting,sadness
we should stop saying ill quit tomorrow heres why. i see at least one post daily saying im quitting tomorrow. im 44 been smoking weed since i was a teen and the only thing ive learned about quitting is it just doesnt happen that way. theres a reason you we keep saying tomorrow and thats because you didnt quit today. tomorrow always seems like it will be the easy day to do it. youll wake up refreshed focused motivated and ready to quitright a whole lot of tomorrows have turned into yesterdays. and that means a whole lot of failed quitting days. it adds up in your psyche. the more you feel like a failure the more you use to cope. the more you tell yourself you just cant quit. instead tell yourself you need to quit. and maybe youll do it tomorrow or maybe the next day. and maybe it takes a while. but hopefully one day soon youll wake up and tell yourself that its today. for me the first day is and always has been the hardest. i never know when that day is coming. its always a surprise. once i get one day under my belt i know i can do two. on day 3 today.,sadness
just wanted to say im so proud of everyone in this sub we are all chasing after the same things mental clarity.,joy
write down how you feel before and after smoking. it usually is not how we expect. look at this writing every time you feel like relapsing. this has helped me a lot.,sadness
why i quit high binge eating i dont have any contempt towards weed or anyone who smokes. i still have a lot of friends who continue to smoke and i respect them. i quit for a multitude of reasons none too large or theatrical. to be honest about it the overeating was the worst aspect of smoking. i know overeating is typically joked and characterized in the cannabis community or even at them but for me it turned into a serious issue. when i was high or in that post high haze id crave and crave only junk food. sugar trans fats and processed to a shred. if i could smoke and maintain a healthy diet feeling no urge for junk food id probably still smoke. id ask friends how do you smoke and not get hungry for 2 large dominos pizzas each answer was different but not significant enough to change my eating habits. even if i encouraged myself to eat carrots and water while smoking the cravings would always return. ive felt an unbelievable amount of benefits since ive quit smoking but thats a post on its own. my point is thc induced binge eating was not some funny stoner stereotype for me but a day ruining consequence that could only be stopped in one way cessation of smoking altogether. if anyone can relate to this feeling then ill feel accomplished in posting this.,joy
its been 3 weeks since my last toke and i havent looked back since. in that time i got my motorcycle license and lost 10 lbs,sadness
ive been a stoner my whole adult life hi friends im hannah. i started smoking weed when i was 15 years old. i was excited to try it i had heard it helps with anxiety and opens your mind both things i wanted very much. it quickly became a daily habit. i do believe it helped with my depression for awhile and in other ways i think it fed into it. i am now 22 years old. i still smoke regularly feel extra anxiety if i dont have weed on hand and get quiet in social situations. it kills my motivation when i smoke during the day. i know i can do more with my life. i could be a better me without it. my mind though is stuck on the excuses. when i crave it or feel poorly i find a way to get it. i honestly feel like an addict with weed and i am. im ready to let go of that identity. any support appreciated,sadness
my nan commented about how much better i seem. day 25 and visited my nan on the way back from an audition and she commented on how much better i look and how i seem so much more extroverted again. she knows ive been battling with depression and bipolar 2 which are getting better thanks to meds but doesnt that the main reason was because i recently quit weed. hearing that from her made me realise how much it really was affecting me and my personality as well. felt like a pretty big win for me.,joy
took me 10 years to get clean for 1 month. here i am. its incredible what perspective a sober mind can provide. yea i might not be as fun or social. im not as exciting to be around nor do i find as much excitement in life. but ive had my most productive 4 weeks at work and got assigned to a really incredible opportunity. ive paid off 5k worth of my 20k in credit card debt. ive rekindled my relationship with my parents. weed made me so apathetic that i buried myself in debt and surrounded myself with toxic people. i was having an incredibly fun time being high but after several paranoid sleepless nights i finally found the courage inside me to make a positive yet difficult life decision. after 10 years of daily use ive never felt better or more confident than i do today. im genuinely enjoying my sobriety. im ready to live again.,joy
feel like a 17 year old in a 21 year old guys body. i spent the last 4 years in my room taking dabs 247 i lost all touch with reality for that period of time. i am trying to reintegrate back into life but i feel like im an imposter trying to play human.,sadness
ive been smoking blunts daily not exaggerating for over a year. i started when i was 15 and now im 16 . i stopped smoking today because ive noticed an extreme change in myself not as active . i want to quit for at least 6 months to show myself im not in need of thc. please support me.,joy
6 months no weed hi all today marks 6 months of no weed for me. literally a day i never thought possible. after smoking for 5 years continuously weed became my best friend my security blanket and the best part of my day. like many of you weed was the prelude to every activity in my life whether that was eating working out studying going to work and even showering. everything seemed better with weed and it wasnt actively harming my life in perceptible ways so i never felt the need to quit. it wasnt until i found this subreddit and took a step back from weed that i realized that it was actually preventing my own growth. although many of theses things have been said before on this dope pun intended subreddit here are some of the benefits in my life that ive discovered since i quit 1 deep and real connections with friends and family. prior to quitting i was replacing real human connection with weed induced numbness. i have now found that human connection is the best part of my life. something that i have to work for not take for granted and cultivate. learning the true meaning of friendship and closeness has been incredibly rewarding. the deepness of my relationships with both my friends and family has continued to grow everyday because i am actively engaging in the relationships rather than using weed to replace the highs of human connection. 2 joy and struggle high and happy i used to pride myself on being the happiest person i know. i was always high and therefore always happy. my life was good and when it wasnt or when i felt any ounce of anxiety i could just smoke weed and suddenly be high and happy again. i felt like i had unlocked a secret to the happy life and i spread the word like an evangelist. little did i know that i wasnt manifesting true joy growth or satisfaction. nowadays i dont try to avoid the anxiety or struggles of life i embrace them. there really is truth in the saying that you cant appreciate the highs without experiencing the lows. since quitting weed i havent been happy all the time ive felt my fair share of anxiety depression and mood swings but ive also experienced joy and a true ability to be comfortable with the uncomfortable. before i used to run from any struggle but now i appreciate the anxiety and pain of life because it forces me to grow and pursue what really makes me happy outside of weed. i want all the smoke now i appreciate the moments of uncomfortableness because thats when im forced to grow reflect and change the trajectory of my life. the things that you have to work for and feel joy when you accomplish rather than the easy escape of being high are infinitely more rewarding. 3. weed is not a hobby weed is not therapy smoking a shit ton of weed isnt a hobby its not impressive and it stunts any internal growth that may have come during the countless hours i was high. since quitting i have been forced to reflect and be introspective about what things besides weed bring me joy. whether thats exercise friendship or creative outlets i have learned to fill my days without turning to weed pursuing passions and hobbies that take effort that i just didnt have while high. i have also pursued therapy to learn the skills necessary to deal with normal levels of anxiety and depression that we all face at some point throughout life. i realized that i had created an inverse tolerance between weed and anxiety. as my tolerance for weed grew my tolerance for anxiety declined. learning to shift my perspective on life not run away from stress and embrace being uncomfortable has been incredible. i feel strong and resilient to any challenge life will throw at me because i am living through america in 2020 a literal shit show actively choosing to be weed free. proving to myself that i have discipline and control over my emotions has been incredibly life changing. 4. weed doesnt have to be forever. there was a time in my life when i needed weed and thought we would be together forever. i was young and going through things i couldnt fully comprehend or emotionally deal with and weed helped me to handle those tough times and create distance from that trauma. but mary jane doesnt need to be my best friend forever its okay for her to be someone who stays in my past and holds a place in my heart. i can appreciate our time together but that doesnt mean i have to stay in a relationship that was eventually toxic. 5. support means everything. no matter what life entails change and change is never easy. quitting weed is a massive lifestyle change for all of us and often one that we have to endure alone given the nature of the relationship. one thing that i acknowledged very early on was that this massive change would be almost impossible without support. so i came to this subreddit and read the posts often and i reached out to my friends and told them what i was doing. i was quitting. after 1 day no weed i felt the anxiety. after 3 days i felt the mood swings and stomach pains. after 3 weeks i felt the depression sadness and never ending nightmares. and even after 6 months i still feel the itch to smoke. but i never felt alone or unsupported because i could read your posts and know i was making the right choice or call my friends to keep me afloat. if youre on this subreddit youre already making the right choices. keep making them. there are thousands of people supporting you. if youve made it this far ill leave you with some tips ive found helpful during my journey and as i continue towards 1 year no weed. throw it out. throw it all out. if its in the house youll smoke it eventually. i know it you know it we all know it because weve all done it. once i threw out my piece papers vape bong and kush i was able to avoid smoking the moment i was triggered. i would have to choose to pick up and find a smoking device. this small barrier stopped me from smoking dozens of times. track your progress. be proud of your progress. i downloaded the app grounded and watched my numbers grow everyday. i was proud of every milestone and looked forward to the next ones. i still do and i still make sure to check in everyday. the motivation you can feel from momentum is both real and addicting. reframe your relationship with weed. once i started telling myself and others that i dont smoke weed rather than im taking a break from weed a perspective shift happened. just because you smoked for a long time or everyday doesnt mean you are a smoker. if you choose to quit weed speak your truth. early on this can be difficult especially if you just smoked yesterday or an hour ago but repeat it until its true. i dont smoke weed. say it long enough to yourself and to the people around you and it will eventually become true. anyways thanks

quit weed july 22 2006 still going quit iversary today marks 14 years weed free cannabis might be a substance that most people can use without getting addicted however for a small percentage of people roughly 9 it can become really hard to quit. i appreciate the protection the cloud of cannabis offered me through my youth. but when i attempted to use it in moderation i was always gradually drawn back into daily use. these repeated failed attempts at using in moderation continued for 10 years. during a weekend workshop in which i had to be sober for 24 hours before and afterwards i was finally able to see that my excessive cannabis use was keeping me timid and withdrawn. my circle stayed small due to the fear of the unknown. i stayed self medicated in that comfort bubble for too many years. i finally stopped altogether on july 22 2006. today i celebrate 14 years since i set down my cannabis crutch. i now have the first hand knowledge that my life is more courageous and inspired. i feel proud to be free from the haze of weed.,joy
i cant take this anymore i am so lost in this life. i toked at 14 to cope with the abuse and the bullying. i was close to jump from a high building around that time. just sat there looking down on the world that hated me so much. smoked the first joint a few days after and found something that made my life simple. i could take the beatings and the horrible shit that was on the daily. i found a way to survive as long as i had weed i could manage. so life became about gathering for tomorrow and escape for today. somewhere around in my twenties i got jacked and hold at gun point at a time i was very high. i have never felt that afraid and the high just vaporized and stood clearheaded in panic. few months after i started hearing voices. thoughts that was not mine commands that i did not think. i quit cold turkey and spend 2 months isolated from friends. was very hard and horrible to go thru. 8 months after i got clean more or less i had life under control well more than i had in may years. started a education talked to a nice girl. got away from my abusive mother and thought life was about to change. it did. my spine had some kinda ticking time bomb illness so out of nothing i found myself with chronic pain. i could not cope with the reality that i had fought that hard and went thru such withdrawals and horrible memories of the person i had become thru the weed and hate towards the world. i lost my education chance the girl was nothing i had thought and ended alone in apartment with no other than my abusive mother to help me. i was never taught how to be out in the real world as my mom kept on fucking with my head thru narcissistic games perversions and guilt to keep my head locked in some weird shit. told me such horrible tales and lies and started fucking with every last piece of what i had left out in the real world. found myself in such a hole i could no longer take life. could not sleep could not maintain. so i tokedjust once. and just like that i got pulled in the escape again. i lost my mind and my will to live. i just wanted to die. so i took a chance and tried to kill myself. got locked in an asylum and stuffed with various drugs that ended up frying my brain in such a way i have not felt myself ever since. went in and out of this horrible place a few times until i had enough. everything in my life was shit. i was around 200kg. fat fried and fucked. took up the fight and started loosing weight. lost over 100 kg. was winning again. was gaining myself again. then my back got worse and all the shit was crawling thru the walls and i fell in the weed big time again. government fucked me over and let me rot on welfare as they did not want to help me so i just kept on sinking in the depression. weed started to become the only reason to get up. the only reason to exist. as i just wanted to die. years went by that way. just stoned every day all day. i wanted to die. so i got up again and fought my way out of the shit again. quit the weed. found my life spark again aaaand just like that i got hit with nerve infection that caused me to feel pain i had no idea existed. they put me on so high doses of morphine i fried my head even worse. i wanted to die again. i started toking mad again and just hazed thru the day. so few weeks ago i reached 40. meaning i have been sick close to 18 years now. with nothing to show for it. i want to die. to get away from this shitthese few people that does nothing but get me drugs and keep me down. few weeks ago i finally find a connection with somebody and i start to feel again. but i am a mess and i yet again must realize i do not fit anywhere in this world as i have been locked in this apartment for nearly half my life. world goes onvery fast. she could not return the feelings i had. i feel every time i toke i get paranoid now. get these weird reality perspectives that i cant seem to place anywhere. i cant seem to find myself anymore what is realwhat is paranoia what is anything anymore. so i started to cut down on weed. and again every toke is causing my mind to fly right off in bad paranoia and feeling people are going to hurt me did that car follow me i tried cold turkey but smoking that much for that long is causing withdrawals and pain to get worse so what ever i choose its fucking horrible. i cut down over the last few weeks and i am 4 days sober today. i cant sleep. pain is horrible. depression is hard atm and all these things i have been thru and mind games and sexual advanced from my mother is really messing up my head. i cant take this shit no more. i just want this to end. what the fuck shall i do. i am so far away from reality and myself it is like every time i get close to something good my life just takes a turn for the worse. sorry for the text wall and thanks to whom ever reads this. sbm.,fear

im finally ready to take back my life 32 hours and counting last time i smoked was 32 hours ago. im done. im finally done with weed and im happy and scared and nervous. physically i feel weird mentally a bit the same. almost like im a bit empty. plus hot and cold chills. after 15 years of being a pretty much daily smoker im done. im a performer trying to get my business going. and three days ago i sat down and made a list of everything i needed to do. then i flipped back through my notebook and found a page dated two years before. on it was the exact same damn list. ive wasted my talent and potential for 15 years. no more. today is the day i take back my life.,surprise
day 64. amazing things are happening in my life. its probably just all coincidence right i still think about it sometimes. but far from every day. since i quit weed i have also quit cigarrettes. i have been working out regularly for a month. lost 3kg and become a lot stronger. developed stable sleeping habits. stopped spending any time in bed between waking up and going to sleep. picked up several old hobbies that i want to improve on. painting and drawing mainly. ive been doing it daily for more than 5 weeks. seeing improvements make me proud and happy. re found my joy for cooking. only ate healthy home cooked meals. fixed pretty much everything broken in my apartment. got new furniture. decorated my walls. meditated every day for 6 weeks. become much more productive at work software developer and found joy in developing my skills further. been happy. not constantly. but thats not what were aiming for is it friends were aiming for happier on average happier more often healthier more honest. a trajectory towards well being. i wish all of you best of luck and courage edit thank you for your kind responses heres a link to part of my story before. just in case you feel the need to check out what kind of hopeless delinquent could still manage to turn things around. just like you are able to.,sadness
i lost the love of my life tonight due largely to the fact that i smoke pot. its time for a change. so as the title states tonight my fianceé left me due in large part to my smoking. i smoke all day. its the first thing i do in the morning and the last thing i do before bed. i use it for chronic pain and to help keep me mellow. im a naturally angry person i use pot to help me cope with other people and i realize thats a huge problem but it helped so much for so long that im terrified about who i will be without it. im looking into getting a therapist to help deal with that side of myself but i digress. however much good it did me it has done so much more to ruin more than one of my long term relationships. i just get so lazy and stop caring about the little things. i stopped helping out around the house and would neglect to do important things cause i decided to get stoned as soon as i woke up. i justified it as it being my way to relax unwind from the shitty jobs ive had but its gotten to the point where i do everything stoned. i have these huge dreams of owning my own recording studio but i always find a way to stop myself and i think thats due to being so nonchalant all the time and not striving for more. ive lost the love of my life with no way back because of the consequences of smoking a plant and who its turned me into. i would give anything to go back and never start smoking pot. heres to day 1. edit thank you all so much for your amazing words of encouragement. i am definitely doing this for me because i do not think i can take another heartbreak like this and its the second long term relationship that my smoking had affected and im just ashamed it took me so long to see it. i wish her the best but as much as i want to i ca not let myself think theres a chance. i get my expectations set so high that when it does not work out i fall into deep depression which definitely wo not help things now. ive got a sober tracker on my phone now and im going to do my best to check in regularly. yall are the greatest. thank you so much.,joy
learn from my mistake i quit for all of 2019 i knew i had pushed my weed use to far so i committed to not smoking for a whole year. when 2020 hit i wanted to try it again so i did in january and its late may now. i kept justifying my use and saying it wasnt a bad thing but it was. and now im back on day 2 off weed. really bad nausea all day today and no appetite. but im fortunate to have gone through this experience before and i know whats ahead of me. first 2 3 weeks are going to be hell but even when im uncomfortable and feeling sick im happier sober because im way more articulate and less nervous because im readily available when work needs me. and im just happier. i love life as oppose to when im stoned and im trying to escape. i love you all this community has been here for me in the past and ill always be here for anyone struggling with their sobriety,sadness

i got pulled over tonight and it didnt ruin my life i am 1 month 2 days sober. i got pulled over tonight and it went very smooth. i had a headlight out and got a warning. thats it. if this had been a month or two ago i would have definitely had weed in the car. id probably have been smoking a blunt. this would have meant possession charges and a dui. this would end my career. make all the hours ive put into school worthless. but that didnt happen. because im sober. im so lucky.,joy

bong vape edibles 1 week clean im a 25 year old guy who started smoking at 13 years old. for as long as i can remember weed has been a big part of my life and theres been many months where id do smoke every single day. weed definitely hasnt ruined my life or anything its been more of a blessing and a curse. i graduated 2 years ago with a degree in computer science but was unfortunately laid off due to covid a few months ago from my first software engineering job out of college. since then weed has slowly crept more and more into my daily life. it got to the point where i was taking hits from my bong every day and while it wasnt as bad as when i was dabbing multiple times a day in college i could still feel its effects on my mind and especially my lungs. i decided to buy myself a nice vaporizer a month ago which definitely helped me feel a bit healthier. however even vaping is still bad for you and so two weeks ago i switched to purely doing edibles. however ive now been unemployed for about 4 months and am not receiving as much unemployment funds from the government as i once was. i need to start taking my career and health more seriously and for this reason i decided to stop doing even edibles last weekend. its been nearly a week and i can feel my brain starting to get sharper and my body having more energy. hopefully soon ill get my life back on track and ill find a job i love. looking forward to continuing this journey. best of luck to all of you,joy

techniques for regulating stress and anxiety when quiting cannabis. i wrote a quick comment on the question of a fellow leaver which migth be helpfull to other members of this community. so i copypaste it in this post hey im a leaver and psychologist psychotherapist that specialised in psychotraumatology. quiting weed often disturbes the neurological inhibition and stress regulating systems. the brains are accustomed to quite a massive inhibition from using weed so the normal regulation is disturbed. leaving weed behind initially forces your brain to auto regulate again and reach a new balance. initially this seems to cause a further imbalance. this is paired with a hightened stress reaction that comes with stopping an addiction. therapeutically i usually aim at stabilising my cliënts and learn them to stabilise themselves. there are multiple techniques and self soothing skills that you can aquire on yourself to prevent or attenuate the normal reactions you now have. classic and well know are breathing techniques. a good slow deep ventral breathing can allready help a lot. a specific technique is called heart coherence. this kind off breathing synchronises your breathing pattern and the fluctuations in your heartbeat rate. this improves the connection between your symathic and parasympatisc neuronal systems i.c. the neocortex and your reptile brain. this allows your brain to auto regulate your emotional systems by your frontal cortical system. the disruption due to stress and a disturbed inhibition system that causes anxiety and depersonalisation can be prevented or diminished this way. practicing heart coherence for 5 minutes improves this connection up to 4 hours. training this regularly 30 minutes a day for a month even lets this coherence to become a new habit so you experience this continually. there are mobile apps you can use for this. there are some which offer auto feedback due to heart rate monitoring. some use the flashlight of your smartphone to monitor bloodflow in your fingertip. you can also use apps that just propose a breathing frequency that fits most people they work well too. an alternative is just to put up a youtube video for heart coherence. most applications let you breath in when a ball goes up and breath out when a ball goes down. using deep ventrical breathing is not required but can improve the effects in my experience. other than that there are a lot of normal healthy habbits that can help regulate tension. walking being attentive to nature arround you a good hydratation the company of a good friend good luck on your journey. its not about winning its about learning and finding a new way to live life that suits you best.,joy
if youre back to day one read this it might help we learn something from every attempt to quit its not a failure as such but a learning curve. instead of thinking ive failed this is day one again look at the percentage of time you managed to go without. being without 99 of the time is better than smoking everyday. 99 better personally i do not believe in counting the days as its something that draws us back to the thought of i ca not have it. a better narrative is i do not smoke weed. using ca not requires will power replacing with do not requires no will power at all. an even better narrative is im living a healthy and productive life and remove all thoughts of weed completely you got this,joy
longest streak in 5 years tomorrow is day 11. 5 years ago i almost quit i went out of town for a whole week to denver and on my last day there 7th day sober i relapsed. then i proceeded to fly home and smoke it up like nothing was different even though a week prior i had smashed all my paraphernalia and sold all my drugs. i got back to town hit up a dealer got some papers and started smoking joints. well now im going on day 11 after almost committing to quitting 5 years back. its surreal. im trying not to dwell on how i almost quit back then and instead just focus on the now and how my mindset has changed. weed is not for me and this time im sticking to that mindset,sadness
two weeks in tonight i experienced a feeling i havent felt before. after 17 years of smoking almost every day 13 30 years old i decided it was time to move past my addiction. the first hundred time i tried to quit i was weak and let myself go just one more day. upon recently finding out my third child is on the way i told myself i need to do better things with my life and recognized that weed has been severely holding me back. my house has been lived in my way of excusing the mess caused by me being lazy for as long as i can remember never dirty but unfolded laundry in baskets and dishes in the sink most of the time. i spent a time throughout the day tackling small jobs around the house each one giving me motivation to start on another. once my laundry pile was almost finished i looked around and could see an empty sink clean bedroom with my bed made and almost all of the toys in the house picked up and a sudden rush of endorphins came over me. for the first time in a long time my body gave me a huge dopamine hit from feeling accomplished even when i would have a clean house in the past i was too stoned to feel anything other than tired and ready to smoke another bowl. i dont want to call this a high for what i feel are obvious reasons but this feeling is amazing and wanted to share my experience here with yall. tldr i got my first endorphin rush from cleaning my house today never felt so good from something that was typically a chore when i was using,joy
i am 100 days sober and it is my 24th birthday today was such a good day. i got a call that i am through to the final rounds of interviews for a job i really want. i was so scared taking time off work for my mental health would ruin my career thats just starting. i even felt okay that if it was a rejection call i would handle it well. i used casual sex and weed to escape my pain and now i face it head on and i feel so strong and purposeful. i know theres going to be more trying times. if i get this role i will be in a very male dominated environment some people may even smoke to release stress. my parents still have there struggles and my brother still tries me with his issues. but this year i am focused completely on me. my happiness and career is my focus i can think about dating again when i have created a beautiful life for myself. i am so grateful for this community i have relapsed before now i have found this page and want to stay apart of it forever. stay strong everyone letting go of the addiction pays off.,joy
5 years without weed and just found this sub ama im a 26 year old guy in the uk. after nearly 5 years of clean time two things are true my life is immeasurably better and i still think about smoking weed almost daily. finding this sub is amazing i have not been to a group or meeting in years and did not realise how much i missed the peer support. i took drugs from the age of about 16 and after years of abuse this culminated in a few episodes of drug induced psychosis and residential care at an addiction treatment centre. weed was always there every single day. it was the last thing to go back in december of 2014. 2015 was the worst year of my life. i had no idea what to do with myself how to sleep how to eat how to spend time with friends how to regulate anxiety and why did music suddenly sound so boring but there were some silver linings i did not have to worry about running out of weed i did not have to wait for unreliable dealers i could be around my family without them being scared of me everything became much much simpler. over the next four years every single element of my life has improved. my relationships are better im more confident i go to the gym and have a good job. im closer with my family than ever. i eat well rather than having only one meal a day which is invariably a greasy takeaway. i can hang out with friends when i want and on my terms without being that weird dude on the periphery that pops outside every couple of hours to smoke. people experience me as a much better person to be around. also music sounds good again. getting free of weed is a fucking tough journey. and its going to be horrible for a while. just hang on to those silver linings and enjoy being free of all of the trappings of active addiction. once you break the back of it everything will improve. i thought people towards the beginning of their journey may have questions which im more than happy to answer love to you all the world is a much brighter place once you win your battle,joy

if youre this stressed out about whether or not you should smoke its probably not a good idea. wise words from my wife. long context went through heavy pot head phases in my twenties. stopped buying for good around 27 but frequently smoked with friends. i really fucking like being high. now early 30s. stopped altogether when my daughter was born. did not want to be high around her for many hopefully obvious reasons. so i made it two years and did not socialize much being a new dad and all so avoiding it was not super hard. then a few months ago i played video games with a group of friends who always smoke. i decided the risks of smoking were minimal. smoked. played games messed around on friends dj equipment. not gonna lie it was a blast. but when i got in my car i was like fuck im dumb. i forgot how tense driving high could be for me friend lives in a narrow street cars parked on both sides neighborhood and what if im in an accident even if its not my fault im potentially really fucking up my life. also we had new management at work and what if they drug tested it happened at my wifes company also what if my daughter is randomly sick and im stoned for that i just felt so dumb that i put my desire to have fun over the security of this amazing life i have. nothing bad ended up happening but i felt like a bad dad for even tempting fate like that. so fast forward to another party a month later. this time wife is with me and is sober and drove and our kid is with with the grandparents for the weekend so less reasons against smoking. our friend alludes to the fact that hes gonna be smoking weed on the porch soon and my heart seriously pounds. i wanted it so bad but i knew id feel dumb for doing so later. id just annoy my wife with my high behavior stay up too late eating junk food and then i basically would be an occasional smoker which knowing my history could lead me back to stoner territory. we left pretty soon anyway and i walked right past the smoker on the porch trying not to think about that enticing smell. i vented my anxiety about it to my wife in the car and thats when she wisely said if youre this worried about whether or not you should smoke its probably not a good idea. thanks for reading its been on my mind for a while. i guess this is a relapse but im done beating myself up about it. weed is not an option for me anymore. period. done. its like an allergy. it is hard but you can do it too. you are stronger than a plant edit to clarify when my wife said this i was not just saying what a bad idea smoking was i was also saying how it would not really hurt anything and in this instance was pretty low risk. i was bargaining with myself because the urge for that strange giddiness weed gives me the vacation from my default self was and will probably always be strong. im happy people say my story helped. remember to fast forward the tape before your next puff. how will you feel after the initial fix,sadness
partied sober loved it. coworkers always go out on friday nights. ive always hesitated to go because whenever i did go i would not have a great time and then id spend the weekend after reliving every moment of partying crutinizing anxiously for fuckups embarrassing things firable offenses. generalized anxiety disorder is a bitch. but tonight i committed to staying sober and trying the whole friday night thing. took advice i saw here everyone else is relaxed and drunk so no one will remember or care that im not as long as i relax and enjoy myself too. it was amazing. laughed a lot drank seltzer turned down offers of blunts pens and gummies. sitting on the train home without a care in the world. i like this brave new world. i think this can be the new me. the happier me.,joy
one week today. the cravings have stopped and i feel more motivated and energized than i have in years. my emotions have stabilized which was the side effect of withdrawal. i still have trouble sleeping and night sweats but those too shall pass. for anyone struggling at first it does get better,joy
weed is not good or bad hi im new to posting. ive been trying to quit weed for about a year now and today my therapist dropped some knowledge on me that i thought i would share. when im about to decide if im going to smoke i hear a voice in my head that says something like you know you really should not do that. you really should go do something productive instead. well today i realized why that voice does not work. there is no what i should do. there is only what i want to do. deciding to smoke weed is not an objectively good or bad choice it is either an effective or an ineffective choice. what is my goal to have a stable career in the near future then weed is not a very effective choice to get me there. but if my goal is to get high then catching up on reading is not the effective choice. when i felt an urge to smoke this afternoon i asked myself what i wanted. the answer was i wanted to stop feeling overwhelmed by my responsibilities. getting high would temporarily allow me to escape that feeling but long term it would have only made things worse. the more effective choice was crossing a few more small things off my to do list and turning in early so i could actually wake up tomorrow feeling well rested. its crazy how much pride i felt after making that decision. the problem with classifying weed as a bad choice is it invokes a 3rd party arbiter of right and wrong. who is this 3rd party that has decided weed is bad society my parents god sounds exactly like the type of people i love to rebel against. im actually the type of person who gets pleasure from doing the wrong thing and still making it work. what i realized today is quitting weed is my decision its a choice i want to make for the future i want to have. i think this motivation will last me a lot longer because i trust myself more than anyone. all i have to do is be honest with myself. is this choice leading me to where i want to go good luck yall.,surprise
i made it 24 hrs without smoking hurray i know its not much and im still eating infused stuff to avoid the withdraw that ive experienced before but this is the first time ive been able to stay away from actually smoking. its not much but honest work d,joy
day 1 and im a mom hello i am 40 and have been smoking pretty much daily for the past 6 years. at first it was a way to wind down after work and after my son now 9 was in bed. it was away of coping with the end of my marriage too. but it has turned into something completely different. i now smoke when i wake up before going to work after work sometimes in the middle of the day if i am home. i smoke before doing housework toking and cleaning used to be so much fun before cooking meals before bed you get the picture. i am what some would call a functionning pot head. i have realized that my relationship with cannabis is not healthy. it controls me and it has negatively impacted my life. so yesterday i threw everything out. 14 oz my pipe papers etc. my main motivator is my son. i do not want him to take it up. hes so smart and has so much potential. i want to protect that beautiful mind and i want to be an example to him. i am apprehensive about quitting over the holidays but i would like to start 2020 with a clear er mind. plus there will always be a good reason not to quit now. pot is legal where i live and it is so easy to get. i have a dispensary a block away that is open 7 days a week. reading your stories has been helpful and i am sure it will continue to be. thank you and wish me luck.,fear
3 months sober from weed. what ive learned smoking multiple times a day can be just as bad for your mentality as any other hard drug. weed is not addictive every addicted stoner says. some people can handle weed and thats fine. but most people cannot. its not the worst addiction to have but when it cuts into your funds kills your motivation to do anything but smoke and makes you paranoid and anxious 247 then its just as bad as any other hard drug. just because you wo not die from it or experience physical harm does not mean it ca not hurt you mentally as much as other harder drugs.,fear
your thoughts are repeatedly the same when smoking. day 7 and ive noticed finally a huge benefit. my thoughts for the first time in years are not a repeat of the same bullshit. i remember reading thoughts are formed by neurons firing electrical signals to each other. however neurons tire out quickly and need to cool off. so your neurons take turns stepping up to the plate and firing away for some time before resting and when rested neurons return to fire away you get new thoughts. the problem is when you smoke weed your neurons never rest. weed keeps your neurons firing and firing. its literally frying your brain but more so trapping you in a loop of the same bullshit thoughts. i can finally say i have a still mind. for example before if i had something to do id think about it for hours and days repeatedly which just created procrastination. now ive noticed i do not think about pending things anymore and just do them because im not trapped in a constant loop of thinking about the same thing i need to do for weeks. anyone feel the same also not suffering any depression. def moody but am thankful because theres a lot of posts about depression here and that scares me i think its an individual case bases.,sadness
two months out of vicious circle. feeling strong and motivated. never going back. hi everyone today is my two months sober. i am 34yo m and i used to smoke every afternoonevening for almost 16 years. not much but very regular. i managed to finish university when high to get a good job and to function almost normal in everyday life. at least i was thinging i am doing fine but i was addicted and do not be mistaken mental addiction is serious and is ruining your life same way as any other addiction. i planned my life exclusively around weed. i had to be at home every night to smoke and i was thinking all day about the great relaxing feeling after i finally light my joint. i always needed to have enough in my stash. i couldt travel abroad and when i did i had severe anxiety. i constantly worried to be stopped by police when driving. i havent felt good emotionaly so i knew i need to stop smoking and that was another starter of my anxiety because i felt like i cant manage even one day without the beloved weed. i convinced myself i need it to cope with my emotions. and most funny i tought i need it to be happy. now it seems to be eons ago because i have stopped and broke the vicious circle. first two weeks were hard thinking about weed constantly. but these thoughts slowly faded and at the end of the third week something in my brain changed. suddenly i felt free and i knew i dont need weed to live. i started to be happy without reason. riding in my car feeling the sun on my face listening some good music and smiling. it was one of the greatest feelings i had in very long time. genuine happiness not induced by any substance but coming from inside. i knew this is the life i want. nothing is better than to be connected with your real emotions even the bad ones. every situation is manageable better with my head clear. what advice would i give to anyone that wants to stop the hardest part is before you quit. weed has great power to lie to you that it is impossible to live without. that there will be only sadness and pain. but once you decide to stop the weed loses its power and you realize it was just bullshit. that youre much better off without it. good luck everyone,joy
treat weed like its your ex remember before you got in a relationship with an ex you were most likely fine and enjoyed your life and hobbies. when you first broke up oh boy did it sting and suddenly all you could think about was every single positive thing that happened and suddenly they were an angel walking on earth that did nothing bad to you. then some times goes by a few weeks months and eventually you realise not only are you fine and happy again but realise that you were not meant to be with that person clearly otherwise you wouldnt have split up. of course this doesnt correlate in every aspect especially if you got dumped but if you got dumped then that person wasnt the one and youve had to deal with it and move on. weed is like a comfortable but not healthy relationship where youre clouded by the positives and ignore the negatives. try and remember any negative feelings or experiences you had whilst smoking weed and use that as motivation to stop. for me i can remember being paranoid that i was doing things to hurt my friends or even just making up crazy scenarios of how anything in my life could go wrong. i also remember the times where after a long night of smoking i would feel so incredibly ill my throat would feel all closed up and tight and id wonder why id bothered getting so stoned yet go back to it the next day. think of your wallet ive realised over 5 years smoking that id spent close to £25000 on weed and not to mention the silly amount ive spent on food at the same time. remember the times before you got into smoking and remember that there is a version of yourself that doesnt need to be high. big love.,anger
yay day 69 had to post this because im still an immature child even sober lol,sadness
i used to think i could not handle life sober but now i see that sobriety is the only way i can handle life. when i was smoking all day every day i could not handle life on any level. i was an escapist to the max. i needed to be intoxicated at all times and when i would start to slip in to sobriety i would need to be intoxicated again. i was scared of being sober. i was a slave to marijuana. now i see that the only way i can handle life is in sobriety. the only way i can go to bed on time and wake up on time and do my school work and be accountable and honest and true to myself and not hurt people all the damn time and to handle minor inconveniences without freaking out is by being sober. sobriety has granted me a serenity that i could have only dreamed of. the kind of serenity that i thought only cannabis could give me. i used to smoke because i did not like myself sober. i thought i was too loud too annoying too human. so i would smoke that away to dull myself into a zombie. i do not like zombie me anymore. i love sober me.,joy
i never realized i was waking up hungover every day day 8 weed hangovers are very real. i smoked for so long 6 years that i didnt even know the crappiness i woke up feeling every. single. damn. morning was because of weed. the difference in waking up is like night and day. i cant even express how amazing it feels to wake up with such a clear head and not feeling like i just want to sleep for the rest of the day. im so happy the brain fog is lifting stay strong friends,joy
two years im sober for 2 years today. i ca not believe how much my life improved. im no longer obese ive lost 24 kg 53 lbs in those 2 years. my health improved exponentially so did my mood and overall feeling about life. im no longer sedentary lingering in the couch like i was before. i became a strong swimmer and a bodysurfer. i ride pretty nice waves and im having the time of my life. i travel to the beach almost every week in order to seek that awesome feeling this is what drives me now. during the week i swim lift weights sometimes walk the dog diet hard everything in order to bodysurf better always thinking about the next session in the sea. ive never had this kind of drive in my life pot had stolen all my dreams and goals i used to just want to smoke and sit in the couch play videogames and eat it was really depressing. ive recently even found a way to not hate my job thats not an easy task i do not exactly like to work but i guess now i see thing from a practical perspective. i feel like a full grown adult for the first time in my life. life is not all joy and comfort its struggling and survival and its a privilege to have some hapiness in between all the struggle. i could say im a completely different person now but im pretty much the same guy just an improved version of the same guy. my wife could not be happier about it and it makes me proud to have been able to be better for her. recovery made me feel proud about myself in life with a feeling of accomplishment and peace. i hope everyone can find this peace in recovery and im here for you if you need me. thanks for reading stay strong,joy
i made it to 2 years last time i smoked weed was march 29 2017. i smoked almost everyday for about 7 years. for anyone out there struggling i am living proof that you can and will get through it. life is so much clearer and im finally living the life i deserve. if anyone ever wants to talk about anything message me. much love yall,sadness

advice for a teen quitting i didnt know what to put as the title sorry lol. im seventeen year old girl and i started smoking over the summer. it started when a bunch of friends of mine came over and we took a bunch of edibles and fell asleep while watching movies. the next weekend we hot boxed my friends car while taking edibles and drinks. i loved the euphoric feeling and the calm feeling. as someone with bad anxiety and an enneagram type four i thought it helped a lot. but now i feel like im wasting my time with it. i dont connect with people as good anymore and im even more reserved. everything i go do i wanna do high. i get high before every meal. i get high before i go to watch a movie with friends. it just feels like im cheating myself with being so dependent on it. i feel like i dont appreciate life as much with it like weed is consuming my thoughts and time and emotions. i dont know if im making sense sorry lol. but yeah does anyone have any advice on quitting whether it be cold turkey or weening or at least cutting back i stay high almost 247 so i dont know what to expect or how to handle it correctly,joy
weed saved me and im so mad that i have to leave it behind i have struggled since 2013 to stop drinking. on january 4th i will have made it one year sober. thatll be my 32nd birthday. i fully credit cannabis with getting me away from booze and saving my life. i love being high. i love not having hang overs and not saying hurtful things to people i love and only hearing about it the next day. i hate who i am sober. i am just a trauma filled reactionary controlling neurotic fearful angry thing. when im high i laugh so hard i can feel my stomach constrict tight and it feels so good. i dont get mad at my dogs for doing normal dog things. i let people touch me and feel more willing to cuddle with my wife. that all goes away when im sober. the problem is that im not living any life while im stoned. i sit on my couch and watch the same shows ive watched over and over again because i know the plot and i dont have to pay attention. i time my edible on my drive home to hit me as im taking the dogs out. so i gotta stop. even though i feel like im betraying my savior. its 4am where im at because im dreading not having any weed later today,anger
appreciation post for my mom for not giving up on me,joy
my gf and i agreed to abstain together. she gave in today but i wont. we were going to hold each other accountable for the first two weeks as an incentive to stick to the path. she was going to lay off the heavy alcohol and cigarettes i was going to stop smoking weed. its been 6 days so far. today i get home from work and shes fully dressed with her coat and shoes on in bed with her headphones on totally passed out drunk. she bought cigarettes too. my first instinct was to say fuck this shit grab the bong that i packed away and go to town. in spite. but why would i do that i would just be giving up. im doing this for myself for all of my relationships and my own happiness not for some pact. maybe if i can keep going i can show her whats possible. just wanted to rant. everyone stay strong 💪,joy
made it one year today after 30 years of smoking. just a quick note while i am home for lunch. if i can do it you certainly can. it has been hard to get to this point i still have intense cravings and it would have been easy to just give in and smoke however i am not a slave to my addiction anymore thanks to all here who supported and encouraged me through this past year weed free. one day at a time x 365 one year free of my addiction.,joy
sober me fiends for weed high me regrets smoking weed lurker here for about two weeks whilst trying to kick my addiction for weed. i have been smoking regularly about once or twice a day for the past 3 years. does anyone else find that somehow while they are sober they convince themselves to smoke. shortly after regret settles in and i become so motivated to quit. this has happened almost every single day that i have tried to quit so far. i just trashed my pipe today after the regret settled in. hopefully i can stay away for longer this time.,joy

just want to stop by and say thanks to this sub and all its users this is probably the most supportive welcoming subreddit i know of on reddit. everyday dozens of people share their stories and nearly every post has at least one comment offering words of encouragement or advice. theres practically no bullshit which is rare for reddit and the internet in general. over the years ive related to so many stories and found solace in the fact that so many other people are working to better themselves. this community has helped me improve my physical and mental health and allowed me to share my experiences with substance abuse in a safe anonymous way that is otherwise unavailable in my day to day life. none of this would be possible without the integrity of the users. so thank you all and stay safe.,love
walked to my local pot shop and started crying all those wasted years job opportunities relationships and most of all time. sitting and watching fail videos or some other time mindless bs. i dont want to be in that position again. thinking of being in that position again with no future made me cry. thats when i took the time to cry mediate and then walk my ass back home. on the way i realized that id rather jump off a building than live with myself as a pothead. my mind is finally healing and just the thought of being a vegetable burned me to my soul. i want a mind that fking worksss. i have never felt this way before. i immediately came home to watch an episode of brooklyn 99 ate a pbnj sandwich. now i am in bed. i have a tear in my eye just thinking about how glad i am for not smoking today. 1dayatatime,sadness

im committing to a weed free january. for me thats a huge change. this post is to hold myself accountable and for anyone in a similar boat to me. lets do this this is gonna be so difficult but im serious about trying a change,joy
everything is going better. im on i think about a month and a half. and literally everything is better. i started a business and its finally taking off because im actually putting effort into rather than doing one hour of work convincing myself i had made a great progress and i deserve to get high. there went the rest of my day. then last night something super awesome happened. i met a girl. and not just any girl shes amazing in just about every way well to me anyway. everything id have wanted. and it went great. i was able to talk make jokes laugh not zone out and she ended up being more than just interested in me too. we spent the whole night and most of today together and moved our next plans up to tuesday because it went so well. its been so long since ive been excited by someone. success guys success all round. high five. edit,joy
a letter to weed i do everything for you. i missed the bus for you. i ditch my college classes for you. i leave home early for you. i sometimes look like an idiot in public for you. i buy extra food for you. i cry for you. i cry about you because youre mean to me. i spend a lot of money for you to just give me a little just a little high. i want you soothing me making me feel good. before i wanted you to leave me alone for all the stuff im doing for you. couple weeks but not forever. now i just want you out i want you out of my life you clingy bitch. out of my body out of my personality you are taking me away from my life. i need to go to school and pass i need to take care of my body i need to be with my family more. i need you to leave me alone. im so weak.,joy
day 355 sober after 15 years high life has never been so good i just realized that in 10 days ill be 1 year sober. have not been here much since the first month or two but i do not think i could have made it through those first couple months without leaves. since i quit my life has been amazing. it took a few months but i got the job ive always wanted. then i realized i hated that job so instead of rolling over and giving up like i would have in the past i applied to a different job and was hired the very next day. now i love what i do and am excited to go to work most days. i still struggle with some insomnia but its getting better in fact i fell asleep last night on time and woke up an hour early this morning which is why im posting here a month ago i met an amazing man and have ended my 5 year single streak. i did not have to limit my dating pool to fellow stoners. its still new but i feel so lucky to have found him. i would not have even made the effort to meet someone if i were still stoned all the time and the idea of hoping hed accept me if i were still reeking of pot and needed to bring my bong and baggies to his place every time i went there is cringeworthy. i think im falling in love and it feels amazing. i did not feel this way in the relationships i had as a stoner i did not feel much at all. life is good. it feels like stoner me was a lifetime ago.,joy
i ran out of weed last night i woke up this morning and tossed my grinder and other paraphenilia in the trash. i do not want to go back anymore ive quit so many times. i hate the up and down the back and forth. i am going to make this the final go. my wife and kids deserve it my bank account deserves it my work deserves it but most importantly i deserve it. heres to 2018.,sadness

the weed routine weed works its way into peoples lives in different ways. take this example heres how my life has gone for the past 7 years. get home as quickly as possible. light up a bowl soon after i walk in the door to get high. pet the dog feed him then walk him after ive taken a few more hits and feel sufficiently high. turn on the tv and crash. order in or cook something simple from the kitchen. avoid my parents phone calls. get high some more browse my social media before falling asleep sometime after midnight. wake up feeling agitated and get ready for work wishing i could stay home and get high all day. repeat. for this person weed integrated itself as an essential part of their day. weed is greedy—its not satisfied to take up just the time when youre getting high. it makes you rush through your other activities just so you can slow down and enjoy the high. except when you look back its difficult to see whether you were enjoying anything at all. when youre high every day its hard to be fully yourself because youre not your original best self youre your high self. like a crappy knock off youre a diminished version of yourself. this isnt the case for everyone though. for some people being high every day isnt a reality they have to worry about. but it can still overwhelm your routine. take this example ive managed to stay away from weed during the weekdays since i can tell it affects me at my job. i mostly keep to it on the weekends which is a great way to unwind after a stressful week. however after a few weeks of this ive noticed some things changing. i dont see the people i used to meet up with for a beer. ill get the invite but when i look outside and see its snowing i just want to sit at home and unwind with a bowl. i used to invite my friends over the ones who liked to smoke but over time and after being rejected its just easier to do it on my own. my weekends are spent getting high and although i put off working out cleaning the house or reading for my weekends when i start smoking its hard not to keep doing it. for this person weed worked its way into their routine even when it wasnt a daily activity. their weekends were built around weed and even though this person knew that more needed to be done weed took precedence. its easy to build weed into your routine. the benefits are clear had a rough day week conversation weed can help bring you back to happiness. over time it becomes the preferred method for calming down. it makes everything better tv music art. until it becomes the standard requirement for us to enjoy these activities. soon tv and music simply dont have the same pizzazz without getting high first. the tv shows we enjoyed while we are high simply arent as funny or engaging when we watch them without weed. art which was a great way to exercise our creative energy suddenly seems daunting and scary without weed. over time you customize your body to expect the satisfaction that comes with weed. this is the beginning stage of addiction. without it you revert to irritability anger or boredom. it becomes easier to exist at 50 of ones potential because weed makes you ok with being bored. doing more becomes difficult because after weed works its way into your routine its hard to remember how you go by without it.,anger
just found this sub and feeling conflicted. a popular askreddit thread led me here today and now im having an existential crisis. i was planning on just lurking for a while but that seems to be pretty discouraged here so i decided to make this post to try and get some guidance. ive been a daily smoker for over 15 years now. ive always had it in the back of my mind that this was not doing me any favors but i would always put that thought away and call up my dealer. it was not so bad when it was still illegal as my guy would blow me off sometimes or not have anything at the moment. but last year my state went medically legal and of course i got my license as soon as i possibly could. this has not been a good thing for me. i always make sure bills are paid and my family has everything they need but i will always spend any extra money i have at the dispensary. ill even say to myself that i should probably wait until payday but my demon side almost always wins and i end up at the dispensary again. like i said family and bills come first and i make sure those are taken care of before i get smoke but i feel like id have so much more money in the savings account if i could just stop buying the shit. after reading some posts on here it did come in to my head that maybe im not where i want to be in life. i have a pretty good paying job in the career field i chose but i could probably be in a much higher position no pun intended if i did something more productive with my time than hitting the bong. then i got to thinking about my son. how many good times and memories have i missed out with him because id rather be smoking a joint in the garage then spending time with him hes only 7 so i feel like i really need to get my shit together or hes going to grow up to resent me because i liked smoking more than him. i really do not know where im going with this post as i feel like im just rambling. the fact that im here writing this means some part of me wants to stop. right,joy
i quit for 7 months and was sure that i was free oh how i was wrong reminder to stay viligent i was pretty active over here i was 23 had been smoking since i was 17 and had an all day every day habit since for six years. what made me quit i had a trainwreck of an evening when smoking. the next day i had to give an important presentation to phd researchers and i could not handle the anxiety i felt knowing that i was ill prepared and smoking weed instead. i contacted the relevant people told them that i was not mentally well and vowed to get my shit together and never smoke weed again. thats what happened for a while. i did indeed get my shit together i removed weed from my life and was so much happier sober. everything improved. it was not until about 7 months later that it went to shit again. i was having a music session around my place me and some friends were making music and having some beers. by this point i had become over confident and would happily hang around weed smokers sometimes i would actively choose to go and stand around people smoking weed just to prove a point to myself to demonstrate my will power. anyway this guy at my place was smoking a joint he even told me he would be happy to smoke outside as he was aware of my situation. i said no its fine and having a few beers in me started this classic and cringe worthy thing of well it has been 7 months i think i deserve a cheeky puff. my friend tried to talk me out of it but being a massive stoner himself it did not take him long to be talked around to giving me the joint. the thing that scares me the most is there was an instant change in my that in hindsight confirms to me that i am a sucker for this stuff an addict dependent whatever you want to call it. but as soon as id had a few puffs my friend went home. the three puffs were not enough i had got a taste for it and i wanted more. almost immediately i phoned my old dealer for a 3.5. it had been 7 months i expected him to be like oh my godddd man where have you been i missed you sooo much or whatever. no he didnt even notice i was gone. this is going off track a bit but just remember that your weed dealer makes a lot of money from you just because he acts like your friend does not mean he has your best interests in mind do not get attached. that night as i said i called my dealer for a 3.5. the maddest thing is i even ran down to the 247 garage and bought 30g of tobacco by this point i had quit cigarettes for 3 months as well and i happily threw this down the toilet. by now it must be pretty obvious what happened i rolled a joint which turned into several joints and cigarettes which turned into more joints and cigarettes which brought me to 7 months later right now feeling depressed unmotivated lethargic lonely and regretful again. my biggest problem with weed is the wasting of time. i have always been one for a bit of an existential crisis if a quarter life crisis exists i am having one and i imagine i will be a sucker for a mid life crisis in the future. age upsets me i get attached to the idea that i have so much potential but i am wasting it with weed. it hurts me thinking what i could have become by now if i never had picked up weed. but who the fuck knows maybe its all part of the journey anyway the main point i wanted to express right now is that you should never stop being vigilent. after 7 months i was sure that i was over this yet it inevitably brought me back to the exact same point that i was experiencing the previous year. do not get over confident stay vigilent and always remember why you are doing this.,sadness

your symptoms are your fake friends depression anxiety no appetite brain fog insomnia nausea cold sweats theyre all your closest buddies right now. they smoke all your weed with you and never contribute anything positive to your life. everyday theyre right there with you smoking all your shit. they never want to leave because you constantly have it. when you dont have it or dont smoke it theyre up your ass making you feel like shit for it. why because they dont give a fuck about you they just want to get high and eat all your food and watch shitty movies and shows on tv with you. but hey you dont care youre just happy to make others happy so you keep on smoking to keep your friends around. then comes the day you decide to finally quit weed and they cant seem to stop harassing you about it. what the fuck man why arent we getting high right now come on lets chill dude dont be such a pussy weed isnt addictive youre just being a bitch about it theyll say to you. when they notice you havent smoked for a few weeks no appetite cold sweats nausea and insomnia get up and leave. what a relief three assholes out of your life for good thank god you always knew they were such dicks. then theres depression anxiety and brain fog the three others who still hang around because they believe that if they play their cards right they can get you to start smoking again. they know theres someone in there that will give in to temptation. theyll try to remind you of it every now and then. theyll make you think about all the good times you guys had getting high back in the day. theyll even stick up for the assholes who left you a while back claiming that you were the problem not them. god damn these guys are hard to ignore. but maybe they know whats best for you after all theyve stuck around the longest. part of you wants to smoke again just to stop them from prying at your emotions and another part of you wants them out of your life for good. so you continue on without smoking yet they keep on setting you up for failure. after having a bad day they tell you hey if you do it every once in a while its not so bad. you dont disagree and you figure its been a while so why not you smoke and before you know it youre back to smoking every damn day again. back sitting on the couch surrounded by all the fuckers who ditched you at the drop of a pin just wasting the time away getting high. but now you cant stop thinking about how much you fucked up by relapsing just that one time. you realize how much depression anxiety and brain fog got to you. you quit again and the same thing happens as last time the same four assholes leave within a few weeks and the other three stick right by your side. this time around you know the games they play so youre prepared. they dont get to you much at all this time because youre distracting yourself with hobbies making new friends achieving your goals and spending all that extra money you earn on better things instead of weed. as each day passes they become less and less clingy and start to lose hope in getting you to smoke again. eventually depression anxiety and brain fog finally agree to say fuck this youre a lost cause and leave you alone and this time its for good. you did it it took you a long ass time but you got rid of all those negative influences in your life and replaced them with positive people and things. they tried to stop you in your path but you stuck to your guns and did it. now a year later youre glad that you quit weed and wouldnt trade it for anything in the world.,anger
how push ups helped me overcome weed addiction greetings from the heart to everyone i hope you are coping well with the current situation and that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. i would like to share with you my experience of how i overcame my addiction to smoking weed daily. now please do not get me wrong i believe some people can enjoy smoking weed in moderate levels. i believe its all about self awarenes i used to run away from my life problems and issues by smoking it because it helped me to relax and forget about everything just while being high. i started to consume more and more to reach the high level that i needed and here is where i have realized there is a problem. i have tried many methods to stop which worked for a while but in no time i was smoking again. until i came up with my own method. first you need to truly commit that you will do whatever it takes to stop and that you will not lie to yourself. every time your brain starts thinking about that addiction weed in my case and how nice and relaxing it is use the mel robinns 5 second rule if you do not know it check it on yt and immediately do push ups as much as you can until your muscles ca not hold you anymore. now let me explain this so it will make sense to you. you see our brains are created to protect us to makes us feel comfortable and happy therefore it will always remind you of the things you felt good about. lets take here as example relationships and breakups why do you think you feel miserable and you miss your ex so much because your brain can tell that currently you are feeling sad but it does not recognize the reason it only knows that its linked with your ex so it will start memorizing all the good times all the moments that you shared together the happy ones ofcourse which will make you miss herhim more. our brains do not recognize that its bringing us more pain than pleasure. sounds stupid right but the brain did that to protect us from sad feelings without knowing that it makes things worse for us. thats why you need to steer control manipulate whatever you want to call it your mind brain for your advantage. if you let it work on autopilot it will destroy you. now when your brain is thinking about that specific addiction and you start doing push ups any kind of exercise plank is also good by repeating that your brain will link that addiction which felt great before with pain negative emotion. make sense now when you repeat that everytime you think of it for at least 2 weeks trust me your brain will not remind you of that addiction no matter what and you suddenly will feel greater willpower. because again your brain is designed to make you feel good and pain will make your brain avoid that in any cause. you see when you go to the gym you are pushing your limits you are getting out of your comfort zone thats why in the begging your brain will resist it until you start to see actual physical results which takes time. on the other hand drugs alcohol porn and masturbation will provide you the same feeling but in a faster way. once you master it you will feel great about your accomplishment. i hope some of you will find that beneficial and i wish you all good luck.🍀,joy
to anyone whos successfully quit and gets a thought of just treat yourself it is the addiction speaking it is not worth it ive been here so many times. so many i feel lost posts so many i need help posts. it took years for me to finally cut the addiction and stop daily smoking. but recovering also meant a lot of other things revealed themself. yes i started being a tonne more productive eating better lost lots of weight. but i still was not happy life was still dull and grey a hole which i thought weed used to solve. 3 days ago i hit a rough spot. im on new antidepressants which take a long time to take effect and during those few months where they are getting into your system its not uncommon for your emotions and stability to be going up and down repeatedly. i had been free of the addiction for a good while and thought i truly had got my control in life back. i was wrong. i woke up one day after a night of heavy heavy drinking. drank so much i do not even remember the night. i did not wake up feeling hungover but i woke up feeling incredibly paranoid depressed anxious. obviously this was all because of the alcohol but i had a creeping thought of smoking knowing it would make me feel better about things and stop worrying. at first i took note of it and ignored it but through the day i just had this feeling that it was inevitable. and then later on my friend was picking up and i just caved which has turned into me doing nothing for 3 days and spending way too much money on takeaways and snacks. the whole time ive known this is bad and that i should not do it but i wake up and feel so terrible until ive smoked again something i had not felt in a while. im smoking this to hold myself accountable and hope tomorrow i can get back to how i was gonna be hard though.,sadness
quitting feels like heartbreak. im currently on day 25 and came to a realisation a couple of days ago but wanted to sit on the idea before sharing it personally the best example i can give other than just saying i feel anxious and depressed is that i feel heartbroken. when a relationship breaks down with someone or when a family member passes or a much loved pet that sickening feeling your body feels when trying to adjust to the situation is somewhat identical to the feeling of no longer having weed in your life. weed was that warm hug when you were sad the thing that got you out of bed in the morning the thing that made social situations that much more enjoyable it gave you a reason to be happy and it was a feeling youre constantly chasing somewhat the exact feelings you would get when youre in love. you had a bad day your loved ones would be your go to the same way weed was my go to. i could be put in the most horrible awkward situations but as long as i had my weed the same way a young child needs their mother or father the feeling becomes less scary. now youre no longer smoking youre going through the heartbreak of losing something you love. the more addicted you were the longer itll take for your heart and body to mend and adjust to the new lifestyle of living single or free from weed in this case. if youre reading this and think im chatting absolute shit then youre probably right but in my mind it makes total sense. ive had girlfriends in the past that i loved i might not have been in love with them but i loved them for sure and the gut wrenching feelings i would have when these relationships broke down are somewhat identical to the feelings im now experiencing now im sober. your body and mind are mending and youre in complete control over what direction you want to go in with it. these things can take weeks months or years and theres no shame in taking longer than others. youll mend when youre meant to mend. sending love to everyone and hope you have a strong fulfilled and happy weekend no matter what youre currently going through.,sadness

im leaving this sub. this is a positive post. a message to you all just starting on your first day of quitting or those pushing and losing motivation. you can do it. you have it within you you just have to tell that to yourself over and over. ive been cold turkey for exactly 1 year today. no more cravings do not even think about weed unless i see it on facebook or reddit somehow. i have improved personally and professionally more in the last year than i did in 5 years whilst smoking. i increased my income by 15000pa and am now on my way to saving for a house. i read books i work out and i feel i am on the path to creating a successful life. im saying this to motivate you not to gloat. i want you to realise that it is possible im not special. you can do this friend.,joy

i feel free i am at almost 3 months. some of the improvements ive noticed are whiter teeth no more coughing fits more energy a bit more confident in social situations more focused and alert while driving. but by far my favourite improvement has been this overall feeling of being free from the habit of daily smoking. i no longer feel like i have to smoke before certain activities. i do not need to plan my life around when im sober enough to drive or get things over with so i can spend the entire day getting high. i do not feel as weighed down. its so nice to just be able to get up and go about my day and enjoy being out somewhere for a few hours instead of being anxious wondering how soon until i can smoke again. it is still in the back of my mind often but i do not crave it the way i did in the beginning. i could not do this without you all. good luck and i hope you get to feel this too.,joy
does anyone else ever call in sick for work just because you need a day this is the first time ive done this since quitting almost two months ago. i used to do it more often when i was smoking because i had more bad days. most days are good now but the bad days are really bad. i do not feel physically sick but mentally i feel drained and exhausted and i ca not stop crying. i do not get paid for sick days so i always feel bad about it but i had to call in anyways. i just need to spend the day in bed hugging my dog. do you ever do this,sadness
insights from 23 years of being high i felt compelled to share some things as it seems many of the people here in this sub are still quite young and struggling with weed use. im 42 now so im on the other side so to speak. i didnt have the reason or the will to ever quit weed until recently and im realizing how much damage it actually did to my life in the background. i have kids. a house. a spouse who loves me. a career. i workout regularly. i take nice vacations every year and travel for work. from the outside my life seems pretty great. but after only 2 weeks sober i am facing some pretty tragic realities that have been sitting right in front of me all along. i used to pride myself on being able to have both accomplishments and a daily weed habit. until now. what im realizing now that i took weed out of my brain for a short couple of weeks is that it has damaged me in really serious ways. i have deep rooted black and white thinking that hurts me and others repeatedly in my job and in my marriage. i have guilt for being high around my kids that i used to gloss over with smoke because hey i dont have a problem right i have dramatic self loathing that seeps into every aspect of my life. bottom line i have woken up after 23 years of chronic smoking to a pile of regret. remember those dreams i used to have about my career things i once reached for that i long since let go of. i chose weed so many times in my life over doing the work. i chose to get high instead of work on my marriage. i chose to get high instead really spend time with my kids. i chose to get high instead of taking creative risks. i chose to get high instead of starting my own business. i chose to get high instead of calling my mom. i chose to get high and basically do the bare minimum of what was expected of me. and now i deeply regret all the time lost. so if you are reading this and thinking you may have a problem with weed or feel like you want to quit. please do your middle aged self a favor and reach deep within for the willpower. trust me you dont want to wake up in 20 years and realize you had a glaring problem in your life all along. life is short. and although mines not been truly wrecked by weed. i feel like i let it steal too many important things from me. im finally done. now i just hope i can repair my brain and my emotions and my ambitions and relationships before any more time slips by. best to all of you.,sadness
letter to myself. no more mediocrity why is quitting so hard and why do we keep failing at it as sad as it is i am currently asking my self this question do i want to succeed more than i want to smoke not knowing the answer to this question is actually terrifying. when i think about my life i have so many goals and dreams being only 26 years old i have so much ahead of me and there is so much i want to achieve in life but every day i also want to get high af. it is always i will start tomorrow and slowly letting my life pass in front of me while everyone else is progressing. even though i am not a complete fuck up my life ended up being just mediocre. i guess thats what happens when you do not really try hard at anything. i have made a decision. i will not live a mediocre life anymore. no more getting high and eating shit food all day and never exercising. no more smoking a ton of cigarettes all day that you wake up spitting black tar every morning. your whole life you are told that all you need is a college degree to have successful career but now you know its total bs. how the hell do you expect to land a decent job when weed took all your social skills from you how are you going to walk into in interview confidently you have been smoking so much to the point that you do not even know how to hold a conversation for more than 30 seconds. i do not even like most of my friends to be completely honest. when it comes down to attracting the right people to your life you need to have something to offer in return. if you are always too high to have fun and be engaged no one will want to friend you. friends aside what kind of partner do you want to end up with what quality of woman can some stoner dude who just lays around all day really attract the women i have had in my life are no where near the quality of women you really want. not gonna lie this has been very hard for me to write looking at my life in the most honest way which can be painful. we see the everyone elses flaws easily but facing yourself can be the hardest thing. not really sure why i wrote this whole thing i guess hoping that when im craving tomorrow morning i can read it and stay strong. to all the people i have let down i cannot apologize to you directly but i have to say it somewhere and im glad for anonymity of the internet. to my parents i am sorry for not living up to my full potential. to my sister im sorry for not being the big brother you needed during your hard times. to my ex girlfriend im sorry for all the pain i put you through i wish you all the happiness. to all my real friends thank you for staying by my side during my darkest moments. day 1. lets fucking go,sadness

do not be the stoner after about 6 years of smoking everyday ive decided to quit. im only on day 3 but things are becoming very clear to me. i have let marijuana define me as a person. i was always the high guy in the group. my friends would call me to smoke at my place because i had a bong. my birthday presents were always marijuana paraphernalia and rasta oriented items. whenever i would miss a social gathering or a planned activity people would just assume that i was off getting high. the world perceives the image that you choose to project and my image was unfortunately that of a post college burnout. the lowest point of my addiction came when i was fired from my menial job for being high on the clock. as my bank account started to dwindle i was still compelled to spend what little i had on weed. i had to move back in with my parents at the age of 24. i got sick of myself and knew i had to make some drastic changes. i started to exercise daily and adamantly pursuit a career that i went to school for. i picked up photography along the way and it has opened up my world. i slowly cut down my marijuana consumption and finally achieved sobriety 3 days strong and counting. i know its going to be hard but i am hopeful that i will quit for good get a new job move out and travel more within the next year. try to remember who you were before becoming a stoner. be true and strive to be the best version of yourself. kill the stoner and let the man be born.,joy
the biggest myth we current and former stoners believe if youre like me youre probably not a big drinker. i tried every alcohol drink known to man but hated the feeling of being hung over and totally useless the next day. so i never really drank because the hangover was never worth it. i thought with weed i could always wake up the next day and do every day things. i would toke up and study go to classes drive cook go to meetings go to work high. weed makes you high but still functionalright but heres the catch. weed makes you fucking dumb. you dont feel your head pounding like a hang over does but you have mental fog poor memory and difficulty concentrating. it is harder to learn. to communicate. to be present in the moment. it is really hard to realize the difference for us current and former stoners. but when you go sober after smoking so much for so long you realize the hangover of weed is bad. and no joint is worth feeling totally dumb and useless the next day. feeling productive present and sober is better than any joint. if youre craving a joint just think of how you are going to feel or want to feel tomorrow. is that hang over worth it,sadness
i seriously thought weed withdrawal was going to kill me turns out i had the flu its funny now but the last 2 days have been a horrific mixture of emotions and what i thought were horrible withdrawal symptoms. i was literally sobbing in bed to my wife because i never heard of stopping weed giving a bad fever and actual vomiting. heck i went through getting sober from alcohol in january and it was all brain withdrawals aside from a shit ton of night sweating so no physical symptoms. at some point my wife the brains of the operation suggested i may just be sick. turns out the dts are not trying to kill me and i just have the flu.,sadness
do you not know your spirit is crying out for you to fight to be what you were meant to be if you are here it is because you have a thought that marijuana may be negatively affecting your life. first things first marijuana is not the cause of your problems. the cause of your problems is the same thing that caused you to become addicted to it. you may have friends that are positively affected by it. you may see famous successful individuals that smoke marijuana. im really sorry to be the one to tell you that you are not like them. you are trapped. you are not trapped by marijuana. you are trapped by your own mentality. if you have ever prevented yourself from becoming the person you wanted to be im talking to you. just stop. you are worth it. i quit 6 months ago. it was difficult and came with months of wrestling with it. but i will tell you why it was worth it for me. i always wanted to do brazilian jiu jitsu. i did martial arts over 10 years ago and have always been an advocate for its benefits. i wanted to get back into it but never was able to make it stick. i took the step a week ago and signed up. after my first class i was excited about it and wanted to go back the next day. the next day was a rainy cold wednesday. if i was still smoking weed i would have easily convinced myself not go. but i had nothing else going on. i had absolutely nothing that sounded more fun than going to jiu jitsu class. if i was smoking weed you bet your ass that getting high and gaming would have sounded like way more fun. the fact that i actually want to go back each day is all the proof i need to know its working for me. ill start tomorrow or next week or next month or next year. thats easy to say when youre stoned. just stop. let yourself be bored. only by being bored will you really gravitate to what you should be doing. you are worth it. give yourself an opportunity to take a step back and get to know yourself. contemplate.,sadness
refused 2 joints tonight still had a great time on day 5 and its so hard to cut out weed when all your friends smoke it daily but man does it feel good to have the willpower to refuse even though you want it. way to go 👌,joy
its actually a lifestyle change that were looking for its not just the weed. its also the fact that we wo not get this auto feel good any more. thats not how life was meant to be. we need to truly leave life and do stuff to feel good. we need to be productive we need to help others we need to work hard we need to contribute to society we need to cultivate our relationship to learn to challenge ourselves to aim high to cope with failures and to celebrate success. we can do all that or we can give it all up and smoke weed. were hear because we chose the former. we know deep down what we need to do. do not give up. do not run away and relapse because your work is challenging or because your relationships suck or because you feel sorry for yourself. deal with it. stand tall and chose life. life is life and its eventually what we make out of it. today was my third day and i feel depressed. but tomorrow is a new one and i will make the most out of it. im in utc time zone so for me thats bed time. good night looking forward to have some dreams,sadness
riding the wave oh my god i just had the most intense urge to get high after some troubling news. i could have too asked my roommate if i could have an edible they said sure. but you know what i waited 10 minutes and checked in with myself again and decided i could go another 10 minutes without one. i did that again and again and again for the last hour and a half about and the craving is gone for now anyway if youre experiencing a craving distract yourself soothe yourself and ride it out. you got this.,anger

do not smoke weed to ‘help your mental health this is my personal experience with using weed to deal with problems or forget about shit. so ive heavily cut down on weed lately ive only been smoking on the weekends which is good for me. i thought its fine no big deal. ive started to notice the overthinkingirrational feelings again which now i realise happened way too much when i was smoking heavily. i can really see how weed can affect relationships and work life etc. also ive noticed that after a weekend of smoking my work performance in the week starts of slow then gets better as the thc gets out of my system. it really does have an effect on everything especially if youre a daily smoker. it might just be ‘only weed but it still negatively impacts your mental health way more than you think it does. this is why im cutting it out completely. i urge you to just try 30 days without weed. make the decision today that enough is enough and its time to cut weed out for good. feel the difference in your mental health your productivity your relationships. tell me the withdrawal wasnt worth it.,sadness

ive been smoking daily for over a decade and i just quit cold turkey today. i think i just finally hit my stopping point. ive been at rock bottom for probably the last 5 years at least. i originally started smoking only because it was fun but at some point it became a crutch. i used marijuana to hide from my anxieties. i would get stoned every day and night and just tell myself stop worrying about it. at this point im completely unable to get a good job that pays well or even offers insurance so im effectively poor. i need change i need a good life. i ca not keep telling myself one day it will be legal and you can get a good job then. no im gonna be 27 in 2 months and i ca not wait any longer. i wish i lived in a world where i could get high and have a good life but sadly i just did not land in that timeline. i have to accept that and finally move on. this is a practice in self control and mindfulness. i have high hopes that i can do this. i plan on applying my addictive personality to the positive feeling of resisting the urge to smoke. if i can addict myself to not smoking then i may just be able to trick my brain into going through with this. thanks to anyone who had the time to read all of this. wish me luck edit i know ive commented back to everyone mostly but i just wanted to thank everyone again from up here. the amount of support im recieving is honestly a little bit mind boggling for me. i do not know if anyone has ever supported me in any endeavor in my life as much as you guys have today alone. sincerely i thank you all from the bottom of my heart. heres hoping to continued sobriety for us all. edit i just want to ask is anyone willing to dm with me or maybe join a discord im just looking for people i can go to when i feel the urge and i need to talk it out. once again youve all been so nice thank you.,joy
if you put one foot in the past and one in the future your just pissing on the present. dont think about how much money youve spent or what you couldve done with your life before and also dont think about a time where you might be able to smoke again or even what the future might be for you just focus on right now. right now you arent gonna smoke weed today and thats not that hard. as soon as you find new activities and hobbies the present isnt so bad and youll realize you dont need weed to be happy but dont worry about the future because youre not there yet. stay strong 20 days in,joy
today marks one week sober after smoking for ten years i honestly did not think i would be able to post here after trying so many times to quit smoking weed. ive been smoking for ten years and id say the last five i smoked all day everyday. i just got back from a trip to costa rica and i thought it would be the perfect opportunity to quit smoking. the first day at the farmers market i had to opportunity to buy weed and i didnt the second day a few people in my group went to smokeand i did not go with them so thats two bicep curls of my no muscle and it will get stronger every time i say no to smoking im back home and theres no weed at my place and my friends know that im going to not want to be around the smell or sight of it still for a while. if any of you reading this have a desire to quit just remember one thingthat is a huge part of quitting. now take that desire and put it into action this is a life change. i ca not quit smoking weed without filling up my spare time with other activities. i have a hike and run planned for the next few days and im gonna try and stay as busy as possible,joy
after more than 1.5 years of not smoking weed unintentional but 2 years of daily alcohol use i used weed to quit drinking in the beginning of march 2020. it worked for me. i am quitting weed intentionally now. i am 25. my entire adolescence i smoked weed. in my late teens and 20s i have taken breaks intentionally and unintentionally for periods of time ranging from a few months to more than a year at a time. in the past 2 3 years i built up an almost nightly drinking habit. i had not tried to fully quit at any point in that time but did significantly reduce my alcohol use at some points. alcohol never impacted my life or got in the way of my responsibilities. i had not smoked since september of 2018 i kind of just ran out at one point and did not feel like using weed again. but i decided during quarantine to quit drinking and enioy smoking again for a bit. it has worked ive had fun. and having quit drinking i feel much better physically. however weed is not compatible with my mental health issues in the long term and it is again time to say goodbye to smoking. old mental problems are coming back up and messing up the good healthy groove i had going. it took about 2 months of daily smoking for me to get back to this poor mental space. its definitely exacerbated by being in quarantine and my usual schedule being impacted severely. i know ill be able to do it as i have before but now i realize i also need to avoid alcohol as well permanently if i am not smoking weed. i ca not do any more of the switching between weed and alcohol pattern. i did not even realize i was doing it. basically all mindset altering substances even caffeine are bad for my mind. i literally tell myself every time im all the way sober after a smoking or drinking phase wow i feel so much better. wtf is wrong with me why do i keep smokingdrinking. i wonder if anyone else here has gone through this process in this manner as well using weed to quit drinking and then quitting smoking. or bouncing back and forth between the two substances over time. thanks for reading.,joy

day 1 i just smashed my bong and my pipes. never done that before. i promised my wife id quit smoking weed when we got married 9 years ago. now with a kid ive got to change things. my confidence is gone im anxious and everything fun about pot is in the rear view. trying to be a better person even if the irritability and sleeplessness are obstacles. thanks for the support other leavers,anger
smashed my pipe and threw out my weed last night weed was just making me feel really sad. it was allowing me to perseverate on my moms death how bad of a person i am and just making me feel sorry for myself. hopefully getting rid of weed and stopping getting high will allow me to clear my head a bit. i am starting new wish me luck,sadness
it has not been improving and i think i know why. i started off this journey thinking in a month from now im going to be on top of the world quitting is going to change me and my life i could not have been more wrong. its always been my mindsetpersonality. not the weed. im a lazy fuck because im a lazy fuck not because i would smoke it did make it worse though. im unmotivated because im unmotivated not because i used to drown myself in weed. im depressed because im depressed not because i was suppressing my emotions with weed. its all me its always been me and im just now coming to terms with that on day 45 i think. its gotten better with time and hard work if you can call watching tv for 6 hours instead of 8 a day hard work. slowly but surely im going to get through this. one tiny step at a time and im going to stick to my abstinence. why simply because i already have low motivationlow energydepression and ive chosen not to make it worse by dowsing my brain in marijuana every waking minute to suppress the noise of my inner thoughts telling me i need to do something productive i need to do something that makes me happy weed made me feel ok with doing nothing and allowing my life to slowly decay right before my eyes. to anyone feeling discouraged that things are not magically getting better they wo not ever get better by sitting there and waiting for a massive change to come around you have to take it into your own hands and push the change along. quitting will help tons but what will help you so much more is focusing on your mental state. i wish you luck strength and courage to pursue what youre wanting to achieve no matter how big or small. edit thanks for the silver and thank you for all the positive replies means a lot to hear encouragement and to know that other people are going through this as well.,joy
gf almost died yesterday. i was high at the time and definitely less capable of helping her. we called her an ambulance. that was all the reason i need to quit for good.,sadness
i wanna get better,joy
quitting weed will not solve all your problems its likely one step in a longer process. ive been posting a lot today but as ive been reading through the site i wanted to share one last thought a lot of people like myself used weed to cope. i struggled my whole life with anxiety and depression and weed paradoxically both helped made it worse. when i quit those problems did not magically go away. instead i was able to reacquaint myself with my own mind free of outside influence. i saw a lot of issues there that i needed to deal with. so i made a series of other life choices. what i did 1 sought out a mental health counselor for weekly sessions 2 started taking medication seroquel that helped me sleep 8 hours a night stabilized my anxiety a bit 3 started going to the gym as frequently as i could 2 3x a week 4 picked up new hobbies i started playing im volleyball at my school started paying more attention to cooking trying new recipes i feel much better now than i did at the worst point of my addiction. but i think its extremely important to point out that quitting on its own was not enough to bring about these changes. it was an absolutely critical decision that allowed me to pursue the types of things that helped me more and got rid of this illusion that i was solving these problems myself through self medication. i also want to echo the thoughts of another post i read today. this journey is rarely a linear trend toward feeling better and better. i can look back now and say i am in a much better place but it was not a straight shot. i hope that those of you who are committed to this also commit yourselves to other ways of addressing the health of your body mind. please be kind to yourself and practice self care. i know that many of us do not have the resources to best help ourselves i did not have health insurance for the first 21 years of my life but there are many other things you can do to help improve your life and importantly your mental health. i really hope you all continue to work toward that 3,joy
i fucking did it. i ca not believe it. 1 year sober. i never thought i would be able to say i would be sober a year. drugs have been such a huge part of my life. i used various drugs from 15 25 but weed has always been my main crutch. i remember feeling totally helpless and panicked when i would search the carpet and floors for weed crumbs when i would run out and have a panic attack and desperately tried to think of a way i would get more when i would get that rush of getting the baggie in my hands running up the stairs and immediately packing a bong when i blow through my paycheck just for weed when i would fuck random guys just to get high. yeah i was a full blown addict. i always will be. i still have my addictions food sex so i still have a lot to work on. it is very frustrating to not be able to enjoy lifes pleasures without it becoming an addiction. but it is not consuming me like drugs. i am aware and i am functioning. this was by far my biggest addiction. life has become so different and wonderful since quitting drugs. i am more social more focused. im going back to school in the fall to study psychology. i am getting a raise and a new job title this summer. i am in love and living with someone who lifts me up. i have more friends. i do not have a temper anymore. i am no longer violent. i love myself. i know a lot of you are struggling taking that first step. i know life without weed seems absolutely terrifying it was for me when i decided to quit. it has become your crutch and your best friend. weed never judges you or makes you feel bad. it only makes you feel good and safe like your wrapped in a warm blanket pardon the cliche. but you have to ask yourself does the weed own you is life simply impossible to live without a pipebongjoint in your hand because if it is you need to quit. the day i quit i smoked the last of my weed and threw away all the paraphernalia. i could not have quit if there was any type of temptation in my house. i downloaded the app habit hub which helps you keep track of how many days youve been sober. i did it without a support group but that was just what worked for me. what im trying to say is you can do it i believe in you. i promise you life will get better. each day sober has made sobriety so much easier. that first month will suck but after that you will feel like a brand new person. do not let it own you take control of your own life. you deserve it anyways thank you for taking the time to read this if you did. i am so proud of myself and i find nothing wrong with saying that. be proud of yourself too. tldr i hit one year sober fuck yeah,sadness
i decided to put the money i would spend on weed in savings. whenever i have the urge im like no this money is going towards saving to buy a new puppy. its helping me because i envision holding my new dog and knowing i will need the extra money to take care of him. this really brightens my outlook.,joy
near day 24 now 💪😊,joy
day 2 woke up really early with only a few hours of sleep to go hiking up mt. chautauqua. also hitting the gym later instead of my usual smoking. im physically exhausting my body out to get through these first few weeks. hope you guys enjoy the view that i was able to capture this morning ⛰📷,joy
for you abuelita. my great grandmother left the earth today at the amazing age of 98. she grew up through wars colombian turmoil the rage of pablo escobar all while raising 14 children. yes fourteen. she was able to experience many many amazing things too she even got to come to america in her 80s she was full of grace and strength and i admired her so much. i was so lucky to be her first great grandchild and i am so lucky to have her blood in me. ive been sober for 10 days and unlike before where id run to weed in troubling times im continuing the streak. if i become half the woman she was ill be elated. so heres to sobriety and to her magnificent life.,joy
1 week sober after years why you need to stop now first of all if youre reading this this is something im ashamed of but im glad i made it before it was to late. i really wish you to see this situation with the same eyes as i do right now so you can realize how bad it is affecting you. truth is if you are here it means you already have that inner side you screaming to stop but you just lack this extra motivation or reason to do so so maybe who knows my situation can be similar to yours and this can wake you up somehow i would be super glad if it did so so who am i why did i stop im a 23 college student that also works part time and im not the average guy that would smoke a toke or another once in awhile. i smoked regularly since my 1718 and since quarantine started i got myself into this shitty cycle of smoking more and more and unconsciously and the less i noticed i was already an heavy user that was burning 5g each 2 days. i was in this shitty cycle of being high 247 when i was waking up until i would fall asleep. i was not able to save money anymore. i wanted to go to restaurants i wanted to travel be normal but i felt myself trapped where every single penny that would land in my pocket my brain would automatically see it in grams quantity that i could smoke. i noticed myself way more greedy with a worse personality someone that was really extroverted i just was not anymore i was not myself anymore. i would skip classes to go with my car to some spot be on my own listen to music and just burn some. my life did not have any meaning any purpose anymore i was not achieving anything at all i was living in a bubble where i was literally just surviving with the only desire of burning more and more weed. i started seeing how severe my situation was when i started feeling lonely and i had my exams at the door and my brain was just literally fuck everything lets smoke the problems and the stress away. i would stress out because i know that i should study and focus on my future career but then weed was literally killing any motivation and making me super lazy and after i would realize that i should study i was getting stressed but guess what i would smoke so i could reduce my stress but then i was seeing myself even more fucked because i should have started way before and again puff puff pass pass. and thats how the cycle started. i got to the point where i thought that i was supposedly making something that i loved and made me happy smoking but after all this years and this months of heavy smoking i felt like i did nothing time just flew and it was just nothing but an illusion. i felt a hole in myself this lack of realization this lack of satisfaction still. why because i chose the easy way the instant satisfaction and real satisfaction comes from hard work and sweat which i was not doing. i asked myself is it that image that i would like to pass to my future kids a motivationless dad that just cares about smoking that probably ca not provide a decent life for them or for myself because i make weed my priority i came to the conclusion that i had to make a decision now stop giving myself excuses stop waiting for tomorrow i had to stop now if i wanted to make a change and some positive impact on my life. i tried to stop few times in the past but for you to succeed in this you really have to not only want but realize how bad it is affecting you. judge your life with and without weed and imagine what you could possibly have done if you did not spend all that money on weed all those infinite hours smoking and spending those hours on useless shit such as netflix or bla bla bla i knew that it would not be easy and trust me its not note i do not want to demotivate you in any way im just trying to be 100 real in all of this and not lie to you i did not sleep shit for some nights i had vivid and weird dreams in the first 2 days my body kept asking and craving for a smoke and it was even worse because i realized how i finally had so much free time so much free time to think about it. thats right folks its been exactly a week today since i stopped and threw everything away i think it really helps and since then ive been trying to replace the bad habits with the good habits such as eating healthier practicing sports focusing more on my projects and etc and after this week i can finally feel this satisfaction that ive been craving and describing above i promise you guys this feeling of overcoming an hard situation makes it all up for everything. the truth is we ca not be the kind of people that starts whining and bitching around and let some fucking substance control us we control the substance i love weed and all of the things it done to me when i was feeling hopeless but its time to grow its time to evolve as an human being its time to self develop in the good way. i believe all of you have the potential inside you thats being wasted because youre letting weed affect your life for the worse. i promise you the first 2 days are hard the rest will come way easier. after a week you will start to know yourself better you will see money finally growing you will see that youre finally more outgoing and not scared of being in social gatherings. and all of that in just in less than a week imagine what kind of impact it will have when we are mentioning years. if you need to let it out and talk this through im here just trust me in this trust the process and greatness will come. i hope this can motivate you somehow i just wish i had found this community before it had a huge impact on me seeing how other people changed for the best after stopping because trust me you will only change for the best afterwards. and just one more thing do not be scared of changing embrace the change you will be surprised. 1 week guys the first week of many years ahead cheers to me and to you all.,sadness
a massive centre for addiction and mental health in toronto doesnt do adhd testing until youre 3 months sober. so camh in toronto is one of the best mental health resources. incredible psychiatrists and programming for mood disorders and addiction. ive been struggling with adhd symptoms my whole life and decided to finally bring it up to my doctor. she heard me and was definitely understanding my concerns but she mentioned that camh doesnt do testing until 3 months of sobriety are achieved as so many withdrawal symptoms mirror adhd. irritability inability to focus restlessness etc. the reason i share this is because it gave me hope for my symptoms. if theyre saying that withdrawal and severe use mirrors adhd perhaps in 3 months ill feel a lot better. to be fair i havent been sober for any extended period of time for years so i have no idea what id be like. it was validating to hear for me. it helps clear up a lot. perhaps i do have adhd but simply not smoking will help improve my symptoms. hope this helps someone.,joy
who else here is quitting for school ive been using the cartridges for a couple of years now pretty much ever since they got to my region ive watched it turn from something fun to do after work to a dependency thats getting in the way of dealing with my metal health. recently i made the decision to go to college which i am very excited about but i dont want to be dependent on this shit anymore i want this to be a new chapter in every way. if anyone here is in a similar boat and has adviceexperience or really anything to say id very much appreciate it.,joy
9 months sober today paws gets better. still 1 day at a time but life is more beautiful each day. becoming the best version of myself each substance free day.,joy
i stopped smoking a weed a year ago and it has been the best decision ive ever made. i was an everyday smoker for 17 years i had a lot of good times and some bad throughout those years but ultimately i always wanted more from life. quitting smoking weed allowed me to become the person i had always wanted to become it took away my social anxiety and allowed me to really open up to others. i hope to continue this path of learning and living and to anyone who struggles with addiction just know there is hope out there. you can do it become that person youve always to be.,joy
this subreddit almost makes me tear up ive been stuck in a never ending loop of smoking weed and vaping all my paychecks away since high school and its just so amazing to have a place full of people that understand the struggle and dont judge or look down upon you for wanting to slow down or quit and live a fuller life. i just discovered this subreddit but i already love all of you. thank you for focusing on a real issue thats been swept under the rug by most of the people i know im going to be spending a lot of time on here reading and learning.,joy
am i the only one i have noticed this really peculiar phenomenon while going through my ups and downs of quitting and relapsing. when i am not high i crave it and feel like it would make everything so much better so much more exciting and surreal. when i am not high i usually feel unmotivated without dangling weed in front of my face. thats why i give in almost every time i convince myself that its not the right time to quit smoking whatever that means. then when i do end up smoking and riding out my high i start to feel terrible about myself and come up with all these goals and aspirations in order to change myself. i write it out all down too ideas for things to major in hobbies to pick up classes to take health routines. then i do none of it fall asleep and wake up the next day wanting to get high again. does anybody else notice a similar pattern in their own lives how do you get yourself motivated motivated enough to quit i am stuck i feel like i have fallen into a very dark place and am not able to grasp onto anything to get me out. any advice is appreciated.,joy
i started sober september a day early. 3 days off and im dreaming again vivid dreams. im so excited to keep this going.,joy
overcame my nighttime cravings battled it out with myself but decided to take melatonin and close my eyes instead. 27f nights are the worst for me when it comes to smoking im sure a lot of people can relate ive cut down my use drastically over the past 2 years mostly because i wanted to fix my sleep cycle so i could wake up earlier in the morning and be productive instead of having a groggy high over. weed hangovers definitely exist i was so tired of waking up late maybe working out going to work for 8 hours in a hot kitchen coming home smoking a few bowls with my roommate and stoning myself to sleep to rinse and repeat the next day. i stopped smoking in the daytime about a year ago because i could not deal with not being able to meet my daily goals. went from using an 8th to a q a week in 2018 to less than a gram a week in 2020. fucking awesome. two months ago i started dating my girlfriend who is beautiful kind and mature and does not smoke habitually not that those traits are mutually exclusive but i think it helps to not rely on a substance. being with her every night has killed the boredom before bed that drove me to want to smoke and just knock out. definitely not the reason i stopped smoking but it sure was a big push in the right direction and im really grateful for it. ive definitely felt stronger anxiety in the last month but i enjoy it i enjoy the feeling of using different methods to calm myself down instead of numbing myself with marijuana. and i like being present with and for her i took a month off of work after quitting the job id had for almost 5 years before moving to a new city and starting another restaurant job. definitely stressful circumstances let alone having a kitchen job which can take a major toll on your physical and mental wellbeing. had my first shift last night came home super excited but exhausted and did the back and forth with myself for about an hour and a half before deciding to just not smoke it was not worth it and i want to make my girlfriend proud and myself too. i read through a few pages of rleaves during my craving last night and it was so helpful and validating. i feel amazing and accomplished today. this post got a lot longer than i intended but i felt like sharing thank you everyone xo,joy
made it to one month. im not looking for a round of applause. i just want you all to know that things get better. i smoked weed everyday for 15 years. after one month of not smoking im actually being able to effectively express my emotions and how i feel. i was going through life completely numb. to everyone trying to quit hang in there and dont beat yourself up if you relapse. you will begin to feel your emotions again so dont be too hard on yourself. stay positive homies 3,sadness
some numbers since quitting first month 30 days weed free 120 saved 4 workouts per week 10000 steps per day 6 books read 2 extracurriculars added 1 podcast started 😏,joy
its not only about being sober its about building a life you do not need an escape from after literally hundreds of failed quit attempts ive noticed a pattern that i wanna share with you all. usually for me whenever i try to quit i get through the first 4 5 days. i would not say its easy obviously we all know they suck but it can be done with a little willpower. however just relying on our willpower to abstain is not a very effective way of going about it since its finite. and over time the thrill of being sober and energetic starts to fade. the low moment start creeping up and you feel closer and closer to the relapse. for me its on that friday night where i have nothing to do since ive lost contact with all my non stoner friends. i tell myself that ill just go to my stoner buddies house and not smoke just hangout but we all know how this story end its sad when you realize has become so fucked up from all the smoking and you still smoke to forget what it has become im curious to hear from you all where does your deeper need for quitting come from when these low moments come where do you draw inspiration from turning your life around is the lonliest place in the world.,anger
got myself flowers for hitting a month thats all really. i went to trader joes and got myself some indulgences including a little bouquet 💐 i almost wanted to cry in the store because i felt so proud of myself and relieved that i made it this far. i made myself a nice dinner and also got a fancy chocolate for later. its been a rough week for reasons completely unrelated to weed but here i am. i love myself and im thankful to myself for getting to this point and extremely inspired and committed to my sobriety. hang in there everyone. have a lovely weekend. love yourselves💖,joy
exactly one month sober yall i cant express how much my life has changed since i stopped smoking 247. one month ago i had a rude awakening when i decided to get high and bail on internship interview. i cried so much that night realizing i just threw that opportunity in the trash because i wanted needed to smoke. that was it i smashed my bong flushed my flower and browsed this sub for hours. it was time to get my shit together and stop relying on something that was essentially controlling me. the week after was rough i wont lie to anyone. then great things started to happen my old professor remembered my work ethic and actually reached out to me and asked if i wanted to work with him after i graduate ive gotten the confidence to go out on dates again and meet new people. i didnt realize how witty i was and i have finally gotten my creative motivation back and i feel so great mentally. i feel awake alive im facing my problems head on rather than sweeping them under the rug to deal with them later. everyone is so supportive of each other and it really motivated me. so thanks to everyone for being a part of this huge life changing event good luck to all of you,joy
take it from someone who is on day 1 for what feels like the 1000th time its a lot easier to stay sober than to start back and then try to find the strength to quit again. stay the course if youre on it. youll only regret it if you think you can handle a little and go back to abstaining. ugh.,joy
every second im better than the one before,joy
smoking weed makes everything relative to the high when you were younger before you smoked weed and all you were just living. sure you had happy moments and sad moments yet you accepted both as they came and lived without observing your mind much. then you smoke weed. people tell you it is supposed to get you high. you paid 20 or so for it and you want to get the most value for it so you really observe your mind to feel the high. then you are sober again and you want to recognize how it is different than being high. so you observe your mind. the more you smoke the more you continue to observe your mind which makes you aware of problems through which the weed is meant to fix or cover up. each time you continue this you are stepping further away from where you started and where you are supposed to be living in terms of heres and theres.,joy
bruh this shit hard,anger
sober for 4 months bought weed today and flushed it down the toilet an hour later i ca not believe i just did that i have not smoked in 4 months after previously smoking every day for the last year and multiple times a day in the last 3 months of my use i had been feeling pretty down this week for multiple days in a row and somehow convinced myself that i could handle smoking again. so i bought a new piece and hit up my old dealer when i got the weed i just looked at it and instantly felt sad. my life has improved dramatically since i stopped smoking i never have anxiety anymore my sleep is great no more mucus im thinking clearly and doing some of my best work. and i knew that by smoking today i would be putting all of that at risk. so i decided to flush the weed down my toilet and throw away my new pipe. all in all it was about 200 wasted. i see it as a low price to pay for the gamble i was about to makeand i think it took actually holding and seeing the weed to fully realize that. im actually feeling pretty proud and happy and am gonna treat myself to dinner out tonight with my girlfriend. just felt compelled to share that keep the good fight going my friends,joy
youre life is not over because youre an adult and you wasted your youth smoking its only beginning. i just want to say for all the people on here who are 30 or even in their twenties please do not look at your past with regret and guilt as to what you could of done differently the only person that matters right now is your present self and looking at the past with negative emotions only hurts the person who is right here in this moment. you can be fourty years of age and have the whole world ahead of you meet a new partner gain a new friend go to the gym or start other physical activities everyones lives begin somewhere theres no specific age you need to be to begin feeling happy. but i promise you looking back with sorrow guilt and what ifs does not help anyone it just hurts you. look towards the future and smile and the good times you had and forget the rest. edit im happy to hear this helped allot of people i see many posts on here regarding this so i just wanted to share my mind have a good day everyone. excuse the ‘youre late night.,joy

i went to my first marijuana anonymous meeting last night everyone there was very nice i was impressed by the diversity in age gender and racial background. people who had been there before seemed like friends. the leader said marijuana anonymous was the best meeting for me to deal with my addictions because im still friends with stoners now im just friends with sober stoners. im three days into this attempt at quitting. im trying not to think what is this going to look like in the long run or can i eventually get to the point where i can moderate. just taking it one day at a time as they say. ill go to another meeting on sunday. ama.,joy

day 119 its all worth it. i havent updated or posted in a while. but im still sober this time. i said before its going to stick and it has. where do i begin if youre just starting out my best advice ive ever received and ever given is you need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable for a while. i know you want to crawl out of your skin to escape how you feel in this moment. but dont stay uncomfortable. you will adjust i repeat you will adjust. in the last 4 months ive excelled at work. ive passed 2 classes in my college coursework. 3 will be done this month. ive faced some social anxiety in the face. it was hard but i made it through and didnt die or smoke. so it was successful. the clear headed feeling is incredible. once the fog lifts all is clear again and it feels so good. but honestly this group is and has been my best asset. i am forever grateful for the over 100000 people giving support. i would not be here without you. ♥️♥️♥️,joy
first time quitter 32 days without smoking. the first 2 week were the hardest. just keep busy. ive been a heavy smoker for over 10 years. if i can do you can too. good luck.,joy
enoughs enough 2020 rise of the stoner getting high 4 5 times everyday for the past 3 and a half years. wasted thousands that could of gone on new clothes cars or holidays. but ive blew everything in my short life so far on this stupid temporary mental escape. heard heaps of stories about ex stoners becoming super successful. i will become successful one day. i will eventually get to where i want in life. its time to be hard on all my actions. actions get results. action makes change. step 1 forgive myself for my addiction. step 2 chuck everything weed related out. step 3 write down openly or privately all the reasons im quitting. step 4 write down insane goals break them down into small actions repeat everyday. step 5 make a reddit post for motivationsupport reflection. step 6 never give up ever theres literally 100 million actions we could try instead of getting high,joy
enough. be honest with yourself. im getting so fed up with myself. i dont feel trustworthy. ive been too cowardly so far to commit. ill take a break after this cartridge runs out i tell myself. ill stop for just a couple weeks just to recharge. or the deadliest one i have nothing to do tonight anyway its not like im missing out on anything. these are weak things to say. i know i need to stop i know it yet i give myself excuses every time. this means im being dishonest to myself at best or abusive to myself at worst. i need to use firmer language. its not taking a break its quitting. its not getting back into it its relapsing. nights where i choose to get stoned and play the same video games ive been playing since 2012 instead of call my family or read a book or get dinner with a friend are wasted nights. theyre zero nights. they seal me off from the world around me and dump my precious irrecoverable time down the drain. i feel weak and ashamed when i go to bed high and i feel strong and proud when i resist the temptation. is that not enough incentive for me to quit pain is a great thing because it tells us what we need to stop doing. would i continue to hold my hand against a stovetop after i felt that it was hot no. so why do i continue to do things that make me feel weak im done hiding my shame and letting it poison my happiness. ill wear my shame like armor use it like a map let it point me toward decisions that make me feel strong and proud. i am addicted to weed and i am ashamed of it. enough self pity. straighten up.,joy
day 80 quitting weed was not a magic bullet for my life getting better im at day 80 now and i was totally expecting my life to become much better and everything be a lot easier one i quit weed. it took a while for it to sink in that weed was not the source of my issues so quitting would not solve all them. ive had anxiety and depression stemming from chronic trauma for a long time. it was not the typical beaten raped held hostage kind of trauma so it went undetected for a long time. i was using weed in order to feel good without dealing with the source of the pain. quitting weed has made me face the pain head on and deal with its consequences mostly grief but ive also had to work on problematic behaviors that became ingrained through years of the same pleasure seekingavoiding of pain patterns. so yeah my mental clarity is a bit better. there are not so many ups and downs. my memory is better. but overall everything is just a bit better than before. quitting weed has not been the magic bullet that i thought it would be its only been the first step towards living the life i want to.,joy
6 months sober and im never going back if you want to quit i ca not urge you enough to take the plunge. its hard and absolutely terrifying but 100 worth it. every single aspect of my life is better now that ive quit weed and drinking. my career my personal life my physical and mental health my outlook on life everything. i look back on 6 months of progress and its shocking. if youre just now quitting i want the same for you. one day i want you to be shocked and amazed with how far youve come.,surprise
the hardest part of leaving weed behind is that i only want to while im high. wtf. my anxiety gets amped up a thousand times and it feels like im losing my mind but as soon as i come down i forget all the horrible feelings and i just focus on the little bits that i enjoyed during the trip. and then i do it again and i suddenly remember all the horrible times. its weird and bad.,sadness

today i am 6 weeks sober after smoking for 30 years it feels wonderful ill never ever smoke again ive done this all myself with no help or support from anyone apart from an app and you guys thank you the app im using is called quit weed and could not have done it without finding this as it tracks money ive saved joints ive not smoked along with all the symptoms of what to expect at every stage of the quit process. im not there yet but im well on the way to recovery. if i can do it anyone can do it. stay strong im proof that you can do this. thanks also to everyone who has sent me encouraging messages of support and to all the people who have taken time out to share their journey.,joy
7 days sober the last time i was sober from weed this long i was in rehab. feeling so proud of myself made it a week and aside from a lot of crying and a little more anxiety than usual and definitely struggling to eat its been amazing i havent had any big cravings yet but tomorrow is payday which is definitely a trigger for me. but im so grateful to be sober and i am not going to let any cravings that may come up undo all the hard work ive done this week. thank you to everyone on this sub i couldnt have done it alone,joy
i love marijuana but i know its time. just like playing a certain video game or perhaps just stringing something out longer than it should i know my time with marijuana must stop. the paranoia constant criticism of myself and just the obsessive thoughts of thinking whether im a good person or not. im not sure if anyone else has experienced this but its my time to say goodbye. the sober me is the real me and is doing a fine good job.,fear

i fell asleep without smoking weed for the first time in almost two years and i slept great. i struggle with ocd and insomnia and ive been compulsively smoking weed before bed because ive been convinced i cant sleep without it. i have a lot of neuroses surrounding falling asleep and ive gone to great lengths to make sure i can have it when i travel because sleeping away from home in itself is something i avoid. while ive been able to halfway quit i stopped smoking for fun a month ago ive been clinging to it as a silver bullet at bedtime. im excited to make progress without it and im grateful to this community for being a source of support and inspiration ♥️,joy
reasons getting high is not the answer im looking for lets be honest weed brought me some pleasure some good stuff there was not only bad i would lie to myself or be overly harsh on myself if i would deny this. and self compassion is important. when i find myself romanticizing and being nostalgic for the good parts of what weed can bring me its important to also remind myself all the negative consequences this has and why weed does not work for me so ill try to make a list whenever ive had a stash at home ive not been able to moderate and use it reasonably. i have always binged on it excessively. when i have a stash at home getting high becomes the focal point of my existence. everything else becomes a chore that i have to get through in order to create the moments where i can get high. things like friendship family my future become stuff to do stuff to get out of the way so i can get high. i isolate and start living a double life which i hide from family and acquaintances. i am not proud of smoking up all the time when i have a stash so this has an effect on my self esteem and self respect. i become paranoid and very vulnerable when high. i cannot deal with the external world when high. a simple telephone call can freak me out. or simply hearing people talk outside my door in the corridor. the creative aspect of getting high quite soon leaves place to a more dark and numbing type of high. there are strong chances getting high especially in unreasonable frequencies will have a negative impact on my mood even after i stop smoking. which is a risk that is perhaps not worth it. positive and healthy habits such as working out jogging meditation journaling eating well sleeping good hours become very hard to do. i become numb to what my heart really wants in this life friendship and love. i delude myself into not caring anymore. but deep down i probably do and one day will regret it. this kind of thinking can occur even while i get high. which makes me feel guilty and most of all sad. often as soon as i get high i feel regret about being high and tell myself i gotta get out of this. once i get unhigh getting high again seems like fun and a good idea. the cycle goes on. if i get high constantly i don even really remember anymore what happened what i did. even if i had a good time watching x movie my mind will forget about that. it is not a sustainable strategy even for dealing with anxiety because the more i would smoke the less it will work. after a while i will find myself just as anxious only that i am also smoking all the time. which is one more problem. the only way to deal with my anxiety is to practice dealing with it naturally. there are probably more reasons but this is what i can think of right now. edit i am very happy and thankful if this list can be of service to anyone thats why i thought of writing it on here instead of a simple word doc i would have saved on my computer. so thanks back to anyone who thanked me for writing it also it feels so damn good to know people can relate and that we are not alone. often when i go out there in the world i feel so different and isolated from other humans. but in truth we are not the worst part is that there might be a lot more reasons. i thought of these two later on today the simple health hazard it poses. putting smoke in my lungs cannot be good. why risk my physical health and put my body through this especially if i cannot smoke in a responsible and very occasional way. pain anxiety sadness and lifes challenges are in a way opportunities to grow. namely by practicing natural ways to cope meditation presence acceptance and many more by finding the strength inside ive experienced this at times when i dealt with things naturally and as a result i discovered i am not as weak as i thought. on the other hand when i rely on weed especially to the unreasonable extent i seem to only be capable of to deal with pain i am giving up this opportunity. i am delaying my chance to become a stronger me. i guess the best reasons are the ones we truly believe. what are some of your reasons,sadness
a day in the life of active addiction featuring booze vs a day in the life of sobriety and general ramblings and reflections on 18 months sober. a day in my life of active addiction wake up go back to sleep two or three times not that ive completely stopped doing that wake up around 6 pm usually extremely hungover try and fix my hangover with greasy food bong rips or more sleep. if was working rush to get ready pack and smoke a bowl or three before working binge eat and watch tv before my shift. if i was out of pot or wine obviously i had to go get some more so id be late for work. work waiting for it to be over the entire time so i can go smoke and drink myself into a coma. wake up repeat with odd trips to the grocery store where i had to get stoned before feeling so anxious and stupid reeking of weed eyes glazed over fucking everything up constantly losing my keys phone purse. very rarely hanging out with people but when i did shitty people i didnt even like who didnt have good intentions with me but i kept them around because they could get me drugs dab carts etc. what else are friends for occasionally going out with my real friend and making a jackass of myself every time begging her to buy me wine as shes 21 and im not showing up drunk and high trying to drag her into my addiction. being late for everything because i have to get drunk and high. oh that concert i really wanted to go to miss half of it because i had to smoke before or was snorting shit in the bathroom. remember none of it because i got wasted. maybe leaving my house once or twice a week. hobbies include crying over my lifes trauma giving myself 24 hour hangovers mindlessly scrolling through social media for 10 hours a day while binge watching netflix shows ive already seen 10 times. never brushing my teeth properly let alone flossing exercising unless hiking aka going into the woods to smoke pot counts as exercise. a day in the life of recovery wake up try not to fall back asleep again dunno if ill ever kick that habit make a cup of hot lemon water with turmeric and cayenne pepper light some incense feed the cats do a 10 20 minute mediation. stretch and do yoga for around 30 minutes listen to positive affirmations. make a smoothie ive recently gotten into green juice who am i and have a bagel with hummus. usually i shower go run errands i like to go to thrift stores museums the library find new parks hike bike take walks with my mom take my parents dogs to the park hang out with my family. pre covid i was traveling for really the first time. i went to multiple concerts every week music is my life and going to shows brought me so much joy as did traveling so not being able to do either has really been a challenging adjustment. but im really trying to continue creating a life i dont need to escape from even in the age of covid and everything else going on in the world. after im done with my errands and sober adventures i get ready for work im lucky enough to work from home these days. time goes by faster at work when youre not stoned btw. after work i eat dinner and watch a movie still trying to kick the binge eating and binge watching but i do watch new stuff discovered im a big star wars and marvel fan and also have watched a lot of the classics still have some catching up to do. i try and read meditate and journal before bed drink some tealisten to an audiobook and play with my cats but im not perfect. sometimes i play anagrams on my phone or scroll on reddit till the sun comes up. sometimes i binge watch a show till the sun comes up. and sleep entirely too late the next day. but i always brush and floss at least twice a day. ill be 18 months sober on the 17th. when i was using i was very hedonistic and had this idea in my head that being drunk and high makes everything better. it makes the boring grocery store better it makes movies better it makes life more vibrant and cool. maybe thats true the first few times you drink and smoke as a teenager you see the world from a different perspective. but after the 10000th time youre just numbing yourself and softening and blurring the world. it doesnt improve anything it takes away the details and intensity. and maybe it numbs the pain and suffering by default but its not fucking worth it. abusing drugs and alcohol to treat your deep seated trauma and fucked up life is like slapping bandaid after bandaid and some lidocaine on a deep festering oozing wound. yeah you dont have to directly look at it anymore but youre not treating it youre just numbing it and hiding it. sobriety can be really fucking hard especially at the beginning. but its no where near as hard as continuing to live as an addict and being a shell of yourself and living a half life that revolves around substances that make you act obnoxious or brain dead or both. my life has improved 100000x over since becoming sober. my life was drinking a bottle or two of wine and smoking 10 bowls everyday. now my life is just life. i went to see my sister and baby nephew recently and listened to my brother in law talk about his various home improvement projects and the work hes done on the house. 2 years ago i would have showed up high to my baby nephews 1st birthday and thought the entire time this is so boring i wish i could go smoke. this is lame i want a drink why is he so excited over power washing a deck when he could be smokingdrinking i want to get high now i thought it was so sweet and thought about what a good dad he was especially when he said that he wanted to make the bar a concession area and the basement a movie theater because he doesnt want an entire part of the house to be alcohol centered for his son and his friends. sure power washing a deck might be boring to me but holy fuck its definitely more exciting and productive than drinking poison and killing my brain cells 247. this is a giant rambling mess but i really just wanted to share it with someone. life is so so so much better on the other side. you deserve recovery and sobriety and to be happy and healthy. to everyone in early sobriety youre fucking amazing for having the courage to try sobriety during this clusterfuck of a year and to continue to stick with it. i am so fucking proud of you i know early sobriety is so painful sometimes but you will make it through this,fear
passed my first drug test in 10 years 30 days clean today. so proud of myself. no more subbing no more anxiety. yes boss ill gladly piss in a cup for you. such a weight off my shoulders. fuck yeah,joy
day 447and life has never been better. i know some of you are really struggling right now. that struggle will last a while. you will feel anxious you will feel incomplete sometimes you will feel hopeless. do not let your feelings dictate your life. grab your life by the horns and better yourself every day. know that by leaving weed behind you are bettering your life. period. pick up that hobby you left behind chase that dream in the back of your mind. be bold be honest with yourself and others. learn to love who you are. the person i am now compared to who i was 447 days ago is a night and day difference. i eat better i work out regularly im down about 25 pounds. i actually have a short term and long term memory now. i have dreams at nightadmittedly this is not always a good thing lol and i sleep better overall. i have more energy and i look forward to what life has in store for me. you can say the same things know that putting down the weed will bring you one step closer. i believe that you can do it.,fear
a guide on quitting weed and leveling up in life. ive been on this forum for almost a month and i think i can contribute to this community. this is my idea of a guide on how to quit weed i hope it helps at least one person. i dont want to offend anyone this is just my thoughts on the matter and i am by no means trying to force my views i am just sharing my ideas. here goes like in everything in life quitting weed has more than one point of view to it. you cannot just take up one philosophy and say this is the correct way all other ways are incorrect.. every philosophy has its advantages and disadvantages so if you focus on just one you will most likely make the mistake of ignoring the disadvantages and only focusing on the advantages until its too late and you find yourself relapsing and being too angry at yourself to want to try again. there are different aspects through which you should view the idea of quitting weed or any other addiction for that matter – psychological philosophical physical social visual. each of these are connected with each other in a way they are basically one big whole but we will just look at this whole from different points of view. i will share my thoughts on each of these aspects in a moment. these are not the only ones i cannot think of any others right now but if i do my job here correctly you will be able to think of some other factors by yourself. first of all i would like to accent on the fact that you should eliminate the idea of duality from your everyday life. the idea of duality is that when you think about something you always create an internal debate with yourself about the thing you are thinking about because you believe that there are at least two ways to view it. for example when you think about quitting weed one part of you thinks weed is bad i must not use it again and immediately another part of you thinks well its not all that bad i mean there has to be at least 1 that is positive about weed because ive smoked so much obviously there has to be something good about it. this creates an internal struggle to pick one side and stick to it because you want to think everything through and make sure that you have the right thinking about the subject matter and that you arent making a mistake about this. now imagine how such and internal debate emerges every time you focus on some thought it feels very overburdening doesnt it in order to remove the concept of duality you must acknowledge and accept the idea that everything is one. smoking weed is just smoking weed there is no need to label it as bad or good it is one whole thing. if you focus on one part of it and label it as good or bad then you create duality and hinder your progress. the things i write may be hard to understand intellectually and logically but through practice you will start to gain understanding of what i am sharing with you. this is something i picked up from zen philosophy if you would like to know more about this i suggest you read the book zen mind. beginners mind by shunryu suzuki. psychological aspect when you want to quit weed you have to make sure that you understand the idea of wanting to quit. if you really want to quit then you make that decision and live with it day by day. if you understand this then you will not be afraid of relapsing because you do not want to smoke again even if you have the option to do so. when you say to yourself i do not want to smoke anymore you are stating that its just something you do not want to do and thats that. even if somebody says dude lets get high come on bro i got a big bud here etc. it doesnt matter because you have consciously made the decision that you do not want to smoke. similarly if you have some internal popup to smoke it doesnt matter because ultimately you do not want to smoke anymore. do you understand what im saying here – you do not want to smoke anymore why should you smoke again because of some small internal though that made you think about smoking not about you wanting to smoke just about smoking there is a difference between the two things what does it matter that you think about smoking when you do not want to smoke. some people fail here because when they admit to themselves that they do not want to smoke they are not fully devoted to that idea they have not looked into every part of themselves and have not unified the idea of not wanting to smoke it is exactly because of that that they easily relapse when someone offers them a joint. these people say i will not smoke anymore except if a person offers me a bud if i find weed on the street if i get really stressed etc. . this is again the concept of duality – if you both want to stop smoking and you do not want to stop smoking how are you going to succeed at either one of these things philosophical aspect you have to realize that when you stop doing something that you have done for a long time your life will change in more ways than one. when you stop smoking you might notice that you no longer watch tv every night at 10pm or that you think about life differently now that is perfectly normal it is in change that we find enlightenment. understand that life changes every single day and that you are paying more attention to it now because up until recently your senses were numbed and you didnt care about life in this way you didnt care about change enough to notice it. accept everything that happens in your life do not try to rationalize and understand every single detail of it to accept it for how it is is to understand it fully. you can always make your life better if you put your mind to it there is no need to relapse just to cope with change. with time and practice this philosophy gets easier. physical aspect when you stop taking a substance that youve been using for a while your body is going to react in the beginning. this is called withdrawal and is also something that is going to pass. you might experience sweating diarrhea anger etc. know that this is a change your body is making and you have to bear through it. every minute you suffer is bringing you closer to that wonderful moment when you no longer feel pain because you changed something in your life – in this case stopped smoking. there are ways to reduce the pressure of this transition – physical activity green tea cranberry juice meditation and so on. try some of them if they dont help they wont hinder your progress. social aspect when you decide you dont want to smoke anymore a change you are definitely going to notice is that the way you communicate with other people is going to change. you may think to yourself i cannot have fun with this person now that im not smoking or i cant get myself to be nice to someone because that person annoys me too much now that i dont smoke. the change in communication can also be something like hey this person is pleasant company now that im not high so much of the time. it is important to understand that people are different some will criticize something you do others will support it and others will be indifferent. whether someone talks kindly or harshly about some idea you have or something you do you do not have to react. you must accept the fact people are different and that that is just how they function. it is not necessary for their words to affect you if you yourself do not want to be affected. visual aspect a good way to help support your change in lifestyle is to make a change in your appearance. that way when you look at yourself in the mirror apart from the fact that youve decided to not smoke you see a different changed person. im talking about a new hairstyle dressing style less fat bigger muscles etc. something that changes the way you look so that it is easier for you to accept that youve changed and that you are constantly changing. so far i can think of this much and i hope this information helps you understand yourself and your life a bit more so that ultimately you can level up in life if you found this guide helpful in any way give it and up vote and post a comment so that more people can see it .,joy
day 365 one technique that worked for me. i made a promise to myself before i began sobriety. it was that i was allowed to smoke weed. however if i were to go and smoke pot i had to write one hundred sentences i am not a pot smoker anymore and today i will be sober. thats all. i ended up writing the sentences like 10 15 times. each time by the end i was kind of hypnotized and never acted on my cravings. i think its important to have a system like this or a plan because if you smoked heavily for long periods of time you will have cravings that are uncontrollable and need to know how to deal with them.,joy
id rather stand in 0°c than sit in a toasty hotbox car im on day 8 and saw my brother for the first time in a month. i casually mentioned ive stopped smoking and he was like ok cool but soon enough he started rolling up in the car. i did not stop him or get tempted to join him but told myself if he does not respect my wish to quit i have to show him how serious i am. as he went to light the spliff i stepped out the car and told him ill make some calls while he smokes. it felt like forever and it was cold as fuck but i was super proud of myself. ive tried to quit many times before but just one puff reels me back into the habit. i want to hit 30 days cleans. then 90. then 180. then 360. im so done with this poor mans drug,anger
today is day 1 after 22 years of continuous use quitting has been on my mind for several years each time i try i lapse within 48 hours. i was never properly motivated but now money is tight im getting older and my health is ever more important. however my main motivation now is the laws on cannabis and driving have changedwell in 2016 but hardly enforced until now. for now if you have a level of thc in your system its an automatic 1 year ban from driving. the levels are ridiculous. ive heard of people being busted for drug driving upto 7 days after they have smoked. for us regular users im perpetually over the limit. ridiculous that they give the same punishment for driving drunk vs driving a few days after a smoke regardless its another reason pushing me to quit. so day 1 is here ive a busy long weekend planned to keep my mind off things. this sub has been inspirational and helped motivate me into quitting once and for all so thanks for that. watch this space. edit i have a friend coming over tonight to take my stash and all other paraphernalia edit2 so many kind words of encouragement thanks guys. nice to know im not alone in this.,joy
300 after 15 years of heavy daily bong smoking one brain tumor surgery and multiple chs trips to the hospital i finally made it to 300 days sober today.,joy
not much to brag about but im 24 hours down last night was my first work night voluntary aka not on a vacay or staying with family or something or just out of weed without a bowl in like 5 years i got home and didnt really know what to do with myself so i went grocery shopping and made dinner. which i usually dont do usually just binge trash food. i didnt sleep well which i was expectingbut i feel good this morning. hopeful and a little proud. anxious about going home tonight and doing it all over again. glad to feel like i have the right to post here. a long time lurker and i would often unfollow when the posts hit too close to home oftenbut im really grateful this space and the people in it exist edit wow i was nervous to post and thought id maybe get a few encouraging remarks but was not expecting this. thank you all. im right in the thick of night two and its hard and honestly i wish i was packing a bowl but im not bc i know that desire will lessen if i dont feed it. im sending all of you good vibes as you go along your journeys as well. love hearing about them.,joy
one year without cannabis. today is my one years old birthday. its been one hell of a journey. i did not think it was possible. after using for 20 years i felt like i was in a prison. i used to tell my friends to sneak a joint in my coffin so i could spend eternity with my true love. ive done a complete 180 and learned so much about myself throughout this process. i will never chastise weed as i believe it has many benefits and millions of people have the ability to enjoy it without having a problem. i know now that i am not one of those people. instead of consuming cannabis responsibly it consumes me. i still get cravings with ideas of how nice a smoke would be and i do not think that will ever change. id like to thank this community for the inspiration provided during this time. im grateful for the support team ive surrounded myself with that allows me to express my concerns in times of need. none of this would be possible without my best friend who i consider a brother that i met on rleaves. we live on completely different sides of america and have forged a life long bond. most of all id like to thank me for putting in the hard ass work required to make this happen. i want to close this by letting anyone struggling know that you can put an out of control problem behind you. it sucks hard. it takes time and work. there are plenty of shitty days before the really good ones start. its a physical and mental battle. it takes everything you have at first but before you know it youll turn that corner and begin enjoying life without a safety blanket. i wish all of my former stoner brethren continued success in your future endeavors and those of you who are considering joining us i extend the invitation to join the club. go out and make today the best day possible and then make tomorrow even better. once again id like to thank everyone that is a part of this community and i look forward to the continued inspiration i know youll provide me. year two here i come,sadness
turn down some joints last night and feel so proud today. was at a wedding yesterday had a few drinks and it was a great day and night anyways long story short someone who works with mr lurkey gave him 2 pre rolls and i managed to stay strong and refuse them. i did battle back and forth and toy with the idea about 4am when i could not sleep but thought about how disappointed id be today if i broke my streak. instead today im super proud so so tired and currently crawled back into bed but so proud of my willpower,joy
can i get hell yeah,joy
without weed i can talk again. growing up i was always very social and articulate. it wasnt till i started smoking that i became withdrawn from others. its like the classic stoner voice heeeyyyy mannnn did not fit with how i normally spoke and because of this i found that i would often slur my wordsmisspeak in day to day conversation. i became very self conscious of this fact and opted in many instances to just remain silent instead of engaging with others. to make matters worse i used weed as a way of dealing with my newfound antisocial behavior. since having quit ive regained my ability to speak quickly and precisely and ive never been happier. being able to communicate with the outside world the way i want to is better than any high ive ever had.,joy
the illusion of creativity just wanted to share some thoughs of mine. i understand that maybe everyone cant relate. i read a quote a long time ago that kinda stuck in my head. it goes something like this with one hand weed gives you interesting thoughs and creativity. with the other hand it removes the ability to benefit of those things. been thinking about it every now and then and to me it completely makes sense. ive gotten so many crazy thoughs and ideas through my years of smoking but those thoughs barely evolved to anything else than just thoughs. there are countless times where i have felt that it was gonna be much easier getting tasks done during the day if i was just a little bit high. mostly i ended up not really doing those things. it made me lazy unwilling to do things to my full potential. always felt somewhere that weed would help me in the process of drawing or playingrecording music. i think there is a honeymoon phase in the beginning of the relationship with mj where these things are possible and it makes you somehow productive. but from what i have realized a long time ago before even wanting to quit it actually works the opposite way. it distracts your mind to focus on the important things. i have just been standing still while life goes on without me. im not saying this applies for everyone but i am sure many can relate,joy
wooh went on a walk every time i wanted to smoke just finished a run and it was the most comfortable one yet. on day 6 id been counting my days wrong lol but im looking forward to one week tomorrow. ive been listening to this dissect podcast dissecting kendrick lamars to pimp a butterfly whenever i go on walks and its such an interesting analysis. best advice i can give to those in that one week window is to face your cravings head on figure out why you wouldve turned to weed in the moments where you caught yourself wanting to smoke. yall got this i got this too 💙,joy
weed have fucked my life up. started as a flirt and slowly became the answer to everything. every problem every pain every mental issue i fought with. it became my identity. first time i smoked i was 14. was love at first toke. some bad shit happened and just like that i was 21. voices started to manifest in my head. i then closed myself in a room and detoxed. was a scary thing to hear a voice in my head that was not mine that commanded me to do things. started getting my shit together and got in education. took a job and that caused a work related accident that squashed my spine. few years after i toked once to sleep and just like that i was addicted again. i realized i have socially isolated myself. been on a reality escape and nobody cared so i just kept on falling down. i am 40 now. have sat in constant pain and smoked weed. day and night for 10 years now. blamed this and that. the sexual abuse from my sister and my mother. found so many reasons and excuses. but none of them was good. this is no way of life. went on a date a few days ago for the first time in years and it went well. but my memory is fuzzy about it. think my memory have taken damage. i toked last night and that deep paranoia was back. i got to stop this shit. its no joke anymore. weed in moderation is great. weed 247 really fucked me up. never thought that the chase for relief ended up causing more damage than the accident. going to cut down. i cant take this way of numbness no longer the paranoia have not left me yet. have not waked and baked for the first time in years. we have one life and i wasted it being wasted. going to get clean now. time to get in touch with myself again. peace. r.,anger
almost 1 year and my depression and anxiety have transformed its not like these dont exist in my life anymore but theyre so much smaller and more manageable than when i was using weed. weed made me shriveled small incapable. i feel myself in more control of my life. life hasnt changed the world hasnt changed i have changed.,sadness
i have a week of sobriety today sorry i just had to tell someone im so proud of myself ive not gone more than a day without smoking since i was 16 and now i have a week. i feel things again. its scary im not gonna lie but worth it. as many difficult things in life are i know weed is not a problem for most people but my life has revolved around it in some form for four years. im 20 now and for the first time since i was 16 im able to truly care for others and myself most importantly. guhhhh. im just so happy,fear
havent smoked in a month and ive lost 13lbs i was a human vacuum when the munchies hit. had a health scare recently and decided to better myself especially with my family history of heart problems. completely changed my habits and diet and i havent felt this good since high school 😁,joy
hit 2 weeks today no weed and no cigarettes. big thanks to this sub,sadness
to those of you trying to make your last toke a perfect memory you cant. romanticizing your last use only leads to picking back up. it is too easy to delay your life with this destructive thinking. like many of you i have had around a hundred last times. this plant never gave a shit about my life or my aspirations. yet i clung tight to my addiction always with a great and plausible excuse to chase the high one more time. the world is passing by and we are trying to say goodbye to a plant. what advice would yall give to those on the fence about their last dance with mj what works and what doesnt,love
103 days hey guys. i was a daily chronic smoker from the age of 17 28 the only breaks i had was when i was on vacation or when i couldnt get my hands on any weed. the latter did not happen often lol. i tried to stop a couple times but didnt last more than a month. for many years i wanted to stop but as most of you know it takes more than just talking about wanting to quit. talking is easy talk is cheap. action is what defines us i know its a cliche but still. i knew for a long time that i eventually would stop. in my mind i knew it was a wrong path when youre smoking every day. so may things youre missing out on. the decline of health economy and many other aspects. some people dont see the problem they re fine by smoking everyday. they dont see it as a problem or rather refuse to. those people im afraid are them that will smoke for the rest of their lives. but not me and not us in this community. were alle here cause we know theres more to existence than the getting high. we are on this sub because we are able to reflect about ourselves and this journey we call life. you got to consider that as a strength. so here i am. its my birthday today. im turning 29. i havent smoked weed for over 3 months and its my first birthday in many many years where im not gonna celebrate it by rolling a spliff. its a strange feeling but also a very pleasureable one. those 3 months hasnt been easy. at the 2 month mark i woke one day with alot anxiety that lasted for a week. i did not feel well and still dont know what it was about. i guess it was my mind and body trying to adapt to my new life and trying to send me signals that would make me smoke again. but i didnt do it i think i wouldve gotten even more severe anxiety by smoking. after all anxiety when i was high was one of the reason i decided to quit. the high just wasnt the same as in the beginning. im a little proud of myself take care all,joy
1 month of no smoking and never looking back again. wow what a different feeling this is 7 years smoking full time age 22. once before i have gone one month weed free but this time is different. this time im much more clear on where i want to be in my future. it was a toxic relationship and it was not going to get me anywhere that i needed to be. a lot of times i would break down and cry whilst trying to quit for 8 weeks continuously yes 8 weeks it took me maybe even longer to actually quit the habit and ask why me why do i have to be the one to do this when all my mates can continue and i figured out the answer to those questions and i feel it is truly to become a beacon of light for my mates that want to quit but ‘cant and also to prove to myself something that i never thought was possible and being able to start chase my dreams in full motion. i remember whilst trying to quit in those 8 weeks i threw my bong out in the bin 2 times and went and retrieved it from a dirty bin both times and even threw my weed in the fire at home and the next day went and bought more. was a q instead of giving up i couldnt accept that was my fate you have to keep pushing and not give in. since i have stopped smoking hardly any cravings anymore i think this is due to enforcing that im not a stoner anymore and moving onto a new personality and life started reading again at least 30 mins per day meditate atleast once a day sometimes twice have become more focussed in my business anxiety and depressive thoughts are slowly subduing eating vegetables nearly every night no more eating junkfood everyday walk my dog everyday now and started to workout 3 times per week still get major brain fog when doing sales calls or talking about in depth topics trying to find ‘that word my happiness and gratefulness to be alive has greatly improved. enjoying more of the simple things like different blue sky textures and the birds playing in the trees instead of being wacked on my couch. deeper connections with friends and family. i wont go any deeper on the list 😅 i think what helped with my mindset is instead of continuing to ask myself why me i chose to see it as ive been chosen for a special task. ive been given an opportunity to better my life dramatically and i need to do this otherwise i will forever be the same if your considering make the change dont kick yourself if it dosnt work out right away. just keep pushing. i believe in everyone in this group and this group has helped so much with constant notifications to keep my mindset clear. my tips 1 make your goals and visions 100 clear enforce that being a stoner is not apart of your new life 2 do your hobbies in the first 2 weeks to distract you from smoking. 3 smash your bongs or pipes or put them in the bin the night before bin day 4 read atomic habits by james clear audio book available 5 make sure your friends know that you arent a stoner anymore and take some time away from them if you need to. no harm in helping yourself much love sorry for the long post. truly hope this helps some people at least 1 person and thats my goal for this post accomplished my next post will be at the 6 month mark keep kicking brothers and sisters ❤️❤️,joy
does anyone else just replace thc with alcohol when trying to quit i have been a every day smoker for the past 12 years. there was about a 6 month period about 5 years ago that i was 100 sober but i went back to the daily thc use. the last couple years every time i do try and quit i just end up drinking instead to replace it. i had to not smoke for about 2 months for a job and during that two months i got drunk every single night instead where normally i would get drunk maybe once a month. i also drink large amounts every night when i do this like 12 beers or almost a fifth of liquor. edit i dont know what im looking for with this post. i know i have a substance abuse problem and i need real help but i guess i just wanted to see if anyone is in the same boat. i feel like this whole scenario makes it even harder to quit. i start feeling terrible from drinking so much every day and it really starts taking a toll on my health quickly so i switch back to weed because at least its not as bad for me as my drinking. my journey last time was really hard and no where near how i wanted it but at least i quit for 6 months. now even 6 months seems like an absolutely impossible task with a 1000 more roadblocks in the way. edit2 thank you to every single person that had responded i have read every single response multiple times already and am taking them all to heart. i really truly do appreciate the kind words and encouragement more than any of you will ever know.,sadness
stuff i wo not miss aka stoner problems aka reasons to quit i was making a list of pros and cons and it ended up being a huge list of stoner problems that ive personally experienced. i assume many of you can relate to many of these in no particular order going on the hunt for green october wasted time trying to buy getting ripped offshorted searching the carpetcouchunder my desk for dropped bits when im out and and theres no connect that feeling when youre in between sacks and you do not know when can get the next one the feeling that you know you should not spend that money on this sack but you do it anyway hanging out with people i do not like for too long just because of a sesh either i was supplying or they were mooches being one or dealing with them stress when that bag i was trying to ration is running out way earlier than i planned worry about smelling like the guy i did not want to be but totally was in public scraping and smoking resin cause thats all you got cleaning clogged pipes and get that foul tasting goo on my mouth and fingers spilling bong water and the associated smell bong water with mold in it feeling obligated to clear the bong even though its way too much smoke trying hold back coughing while your face turns red and your eyes bug out sore throatlungs dead lightersno firetoo much windshivering in the cold people stealing your lighter guilt when you realize you accidentally stole someones lighter ripping your last paper rolling with the glue on the wrong side making a mouthpiece for a j with cardboard that has printing that ca not be good to smoke but you know youre going to burn it a little cause you do not want to waste any precious herb seeing a bag of dried plant as having so precious smoking out of some sketchy bootleg setup cause thats all thats around even though its unhealthy worrying about alzheimers because im smoking out of something with aluminum not sure this is true but i worry about it anyway but i was not actually doing anything about it hiding and sneaking around lying to your family andor friends holes in my clothes and couch made by fallen cherries coughing till your eyes water after a huge hit constant minor coughs getting a coldthe flu too often and having it last too long that gurgle thing you get in your lower lung sometimes when you breathe real deep waking up with clogged sinuses inhaling tobacco smoke from a bluntspliff even though youre trying to quit cigarettes just cause you ca not say no to getting high being afraid to answer the phonedoor disliking interacting with people but also feeling lonely party awkwardness when everyone is drinking but no one smokes feeling tired constantly feeling stuck in a rut indecisiveness slow wit jokes going over my head stuttering and difficulty with words clumsiness having trouble waking up having trouble sleeping without it legal worries food shopping disasters eating way too much crappy food always being late to moviesconcerts because you gotta smoke first being late to everything because you ca not keep track of time forgetting something important but remembering to roll one sneezing or coughing while trying to roll and it ends up everywhere except in the paper but you sweep it up and smoke it anyway even with the dirt and hair headaches from a seed because you had to re up from someone other than your favorite dealer couch lock watching really stupid shit on tv for way too long falling asleep in a strange position and waking up with horrible neckback pains dishes that overflow the sink putting everything on hold to smoke first breaking glass pieces you paid too much for getting some that was sprayed with something the guy says this shit is fire i tried some and its the best but thats what dude always says and its mediocre at best and probably has seeds but thats all you can get at the moment brutal dry eye when you wear contacts red eyes that even eye drops ca not fix cottonmouth so bad that your lips get stuck all curled up smoking so much you get dizzy and ca not stand ignoring the present because youre looking forward to the next time you can smoke being emotionally illiterate neglecting relationships never getting around to calling people you really should letting very important things slide till its too late paranoia that everyone on public transit can tell you havehad some being awful at something complicated that youre actually quite good at if youre sober some kind of problem at work that would not be such a big deal if you did not show up baked not remembering half the movies you saw immediately forgetting someones name actually not remembering most things in general lost chunks of time when youre waiting to smoke and time ca not move fast enough throwing your whole day off with a wake n bake chasing that first high by smoking a ton but its not the same wanting to be high when youre sober and wanting to be sober when youre high when the stoned giggles do not even happen anymore because you smoke so much edibles do not get you high enough because you smoke so much if i have some in the house i have to smoke it no way i can save it for later the feeling that you need to smoke to deal with some situation the feeling that something wo not be enjoyable without smoking first burning your thumb or hair telling the same stories and having the same conversations over and over other peoples spit on the pipejointblunt feeling dumb and passive because ive smoked too much no matter how much you smoke your problems are still right there when you come down and the problems might even be worse because you put them off feeling like a failure but doing nothing about it im so glad im quitting and i wo not have to deal with any of this crap anymore. thanks for being here leaves edited to fix formatting. can you tell im new,sadness
over fifty years old over one hundred days sober. yes proud i feel i ‘ve made it so far. was worth the cravings the anxiety depression of the first weeks. the ups and downs that still go on diminishing. i got me back a healthy body a clear mind a feeling of control. i can now even try to help others. just starting to see behind the curtain though. and there lie more beasts calm and waiting. i really dont know if i want to fight them too or let them be as if they were not mine. hope to get even stronger even calmer day by day. i can just stay aware and wait. i am just over fifty just over 100 days clean. older and younger than most of you if that matters.,joy
day 9who am i i cannot put into words how different my life feels after a little time away from marijuana. i had no expectations on this journey the only thing i knew is that it had to be done. and now i do not even recognize my face in the mirror. every morning i notice something new about myself. my eyes do not look empty they look bright energetic full of life. my skin is sooo much clearer my voice less raspy. my hair is darker and shinier much healthier than before. who am i let me tell you who i am i am ustaywavey and i am becoming the hero of my life again. i feel like i own who i am and what has helped the most give me this feeling of empowerment are the new habits i started since i stopped smoking pot. these are some of my new habits i have replaced my addiction with. i hope i can inspire one another person the posts on here have kept me going through the hard times. it was an uphill battle with insomnia cravings and overall apathy but you must embrace the process to overcome the storm. the rainbow at the end is goddamn beautiful. i am getting up everyday at 445 am and can finally fall asleep early between 9 30 and 10 pm. i am spending most of my time in my studies aggressively pursuing my dreams. i want to and one day will become a machine learning engineer. i am in the gym most days. my body is getting stronger and i feel more confident in myself i meditate twice a day the anxiety about my life is gone. i practice positive affirmations and remind myself all of the great things that make me me and how truly blessed i am to be where i am today. you cannot be stressed and worried when you are always grateful for the situation you are in my friends some of whom i have not spoken to in years really missed me. i am making a commitment to call one friend i have not spoken to in a while to say hello and catch up. i have a self care routine for my skin hair and teeth. i am feeling better and better about myself. i started bullet journaling and it has been an absolute game changer. nothing feels unachievable this is the most empowering feeling of my journey i spend more and more time by myself in nature and have started getting into photography. nothing major yet i blog and write about my journey into the tech industry i am building a website that can educate children on how simple and fun coding can be this is not a habit but that smokers cough is gone. to overcome our addiction we must invest more and more effort and energy into living a life that we no longer want to escape from. its not easy and some days it is extremely exhausting. but it is so much more rewarding than smoking cheers mates blessings to you all on your journies,joy
i did it thanks leavers for your help along the way,joy
day 1 its all gone just threw everything i owned out. bongs papers even some weed lying around in a jar that i had actually forgotten about. it was soo hard to do and i contemplated one last hit but i didnt. i threw that weed out. day one here we go we can do this,sadness
feel like a different person i woke up this morning for the first time in 2 years and my first thought wasnt about weed. im so happy. love you all your posts have given me power and strength. we can all get there if we want it bad enough.,joy
the secret of change is to focus all your energy not on fighting the old but on building the new socrates ive had about 30 motivational quotes as a desktop background for a few weeks now but seeing this today was like seeing it for the first time. so much of addiction recovery puts all the focus on fighting the addiction. we focus on not using not relapsing the underlying message is that were taking something away. but as proven time and time again what you focus on is what grows. focus on quitting not having something lacking depriving yourself and its a struggle. instead focus on building the life you want for yourself. its so much easier to put your focus on the things you can be doing instead of the things youre not allowing yourself to do. today is my day off and instead of spending the day stoned or not stoned wishing i could be stoned i have been eating healthfully i exercised for the first time in weeks cleaned up my room and sat outside in the sunshine and read for a while. what are you doing to create a better version of yourself today,joy
if you stop smoking today you will reach 100 days by new years repurposed from rstopdrinking and uwallssofjericho,anger
to all the people quitting during the holidays to all the people quitting during the holidays just a quick note. i find it nearly impossible to quit at anytime nevermind the holidays. the strength you guys and gals are showing by choosing this time of year to quit is nothing short of inspirational. hang onto that. know you are strong. you got this merry christmas everyone,joy
day 93 reasons why i am so grateful on this day to have stopped 93 days ago. worth every tear thru all the agony of sobriety. i speak at a meeting today in front of representatives advocates the family the medical team and the ceo of my company on behalf of my client the continuation of his services. because im 93 days removed from weed i can turn the nerves from dread to excitement meditate on this being an opportunity rather than a chore hold onto my thoughts rather than blank mid sentence hold eye contact rather strongly rather than quickly look downmy eyes are open now theyre open and clear and alive and bright rather than tired red baggy dead speak with confidence and a steady voice rather than drift off and collect myself with um hold my hands in front of me rather than fidget handle the possibility of potentially messing up rather than drowning in defeat catastrophic thoughts of failure holy shit i justhave been riddled with these issues for the past 4 years and it has impacted my professionalism in a way i didnt even realize until i stopped. it hasnt be easy to stop and stay sober this long its a battle but my life is exceptionally more fulfilled sober. best of luck.,joy
this is the first 420 ive been off the weed since high school. 136 days and going strong. you all can keep clean too,joy
my dad ripped bongs daily until he died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd. hi all throwaway because throwaway. since he was 16 my dad smoked weed. he was about 37 when i was born. the man i knew as my father was a shell of a person. he was an artist and quite talented. he was kind and sometimes funny. but mostly he just sat on the couch watching shitty tv ripping bongs all day. his house was disgusting. he grew his own weed which enticed many of his gross friends to come over all the time. one of them broke into his house and robbed his corpse before calling 000 911. he died when i was 20. im 25 now. when he was alive he grossed me out so much that i knew i would never smoke weed. alas when my friend said she had some i tried it in grief and with naive bravado in an effort to understand why my dad chose this substance over his kids. i wanted to prove that i could start and quit something that he never could. well as you can imagine that first experience felt pretty damn great. i tried it again once with fake weed and the high was so incredible i was dancing with colours and music felt alive. this got me into dmt briefly and magic mushrooms. but mostly i smoked weed. not every day. rarely ripping bongs. but enough to be using it as an escape. enough for it to seriously impact my mood increasing my anxiety and allowing me to be satisfied with mediocrity to ignore the fear and dread that has been welling up inside me since that first time with my friend. i flushed it all down the toilet yesterday. im done. i will not let this tricky conniving little plant own my life like it did my dads. im not saying its the devils lettuce or bad for everyone but you need to recognise if you have a problem and get it out of your life once you do. too easily i began accepting subpar standards of living and isolation. no more.,joy
1 year thc free today today is my 1 year anniversary without thc. i was a heavy user from 1999 2019. its been a difficult year. not so much due to the quitting after 2 3 weeks i rarely thought about using thc. difficulty falling asleep the first 2 3 weeks then sleep returned to normal. at about the 2 3 month mark out of nowhere i started having major sleep issues not with falling asleep but with staying asleep. i started having these stress dreams as my sleep therapist called them. waking up trying to solve pointless problems then drifting to a place between sleep and wakefulness from 2am 6am and waking up completely exhausted. cbt helped and tweaking my sleeping window helped me figure that out. i was exercising but increasing that also helped. sleep issue solved around the 7 month mark. i had brutal headaches this spring to summer and after a few doctors and blood work turned up nothing he asked when was your last eye exam durrr suffered for months and it was just an astigmatism. i just needed glasses 😆 these last two months ive had an issue where i get disoriented when doing things like grocery shopping. my eye doctor noticed nystagmus which is an uncontrolled eye movement. just had an mri which turned out fine so i am going to see a ent doctor today. trying to rule out vertigo inner ear issues. havent felt well in 9 months. throw in quarantine a special needs child and a premenopausal wife life has not been easy 😆 my mediation practice i began 1 year ago today have been my savior. accepting the discomfort of these issues and separating them from suffering. no need to suffer body is just having issues. i am fine. ive also quit drinking changed my diet lost 30 pounds. i am primed for when i get past whatever my health issues are. quitting isnt easy but it is absolutely worth it and i encourage you all to stick with it,joy
2 years since my last smoke the past year was such a whirlwind marked by the painful loss of my incredible father a move to another continent to be with my family and a full career change. i was actually shocked to realize its been 2 whole ass years since the last time i rolled one. i do not know if sharing this will help anyone and im sorry its long but i hope so because i know how hard it is to get beyond that one more day. im turning 31 next month. i spent most of my 20s stoned out of my mind. i was an externally functional and stealth stoner no one even my closest friends realized that i was high literally all the time including at work or they just assumed it was nothing serious. as someone with years of practice hiding my mental health issues as well i was caught in a trap of disassociation numbed out suicidal depression executive dysfunction and suppressed anxiety but all behind a guise of someone who had it together with a big smile. i tried quitting so many times never lasted a day one more wo not hurt eventually things fell apart piece by piece but i kept smoking. it took a huge paranoid meltdown at a kendrick lamar concert yeah ruined that birthday gift from my partner to realize that something had to change. i did the opposite of one more smoke i did one more day without smokinglets just see if i can do that then i can smoke. i signed up for therapy which used up the money i would have used for weed. i told my friends so they could hold me accountable i staged my own intervention basically and i would stay with them when i was struggling. my partner who was not hooked but smoked with me stopped in support. i threw myself into an obsessive art project that took up all my mental energy. i do not know why it worked but it did. once my dad got sick though there was no choice i could not be stoned if i was going to show up for my family. it did not help that i felt guilty as fuck for being so absent over the years. let me tell you if theres one reason to quit its so you can show up for your loved ones before its too late. listen quitting was hell. the revelation and the sunshine honey did not come right away. i got up close and personal with my darkest demons and started to realize how many mistakes and fucked up choices i had done in my haze over the years. i slowly realized and am still realizing just how bad my mental health issues are. i realized how many friends i lost because i was too stoned to show up or reply. im not blaming the weed because 100 i made my choices and my depression and anxiety played a huge part but the weed blurs everything. i used it as a constant escape an act of fear every single time. its been fucking hard guys. but so so so worth it. im finally facing up to the years of unaccountability. im finally showing up for my family. im finally showing up for myself and taking steps to deal with my mental health. i actually am experiencing life again. i have a great job with an amazing company that im trying really hard not to fuck up with my depression. but despite this being one of the hardest years of my life for the first time in a while i am proud of myself. 2 years baby. fuck yes please know it is possible and worth it. and no its not easy but youd be surprised at what the human spirit can withstand. even if you fail that is not a determinant of destiny it just means you tried which is fucking badass. i still need to tell myself this its a process,sadness
what weed does to me i was about to head to the dispensary but i opened reddit and read a post on leaves and i was able to stop myself. heres my list 1. makes me very emotionally unstable on the comedown. a passive aggressive comment from a roommate will have me bawling. 2. makes me feel guilty since ive been telling people im trying to quit and then doing it behind their backs. 3. makes me less articulate. i even had to google for the word articulate 4. makes me sleep poorly. 5. makes me impulsive. 6. damages my lungs. 7. inhibits my ability to study. im trying to study algorithms for job interviews and it really requires strong short term memory 8. makes me feel like an addict. i go through periods where i ca not stop thinking about how to get high. 9. makes me compensate for depression and not get at the root issues. 10. makes me feel like a hypocrite for judging my stoner roommate and then sneaking it in myself. thanks to everyone else for sharing and motivating me to share my thoughts,sadness
i used to look down on this subreddit i gotta be honest in case anyone else is lurking and in my position i thought the posters here looked silly i couldnt believe people thought weed was soooooo bad i was just totally in denial about my use. this community is one of the most helpful things now. ive only smoked around 5 times in the last 14 days and im very optimistic about the future. yall really are great and i hate that i used to think that.,joy
1 year free from cannabinoids thank you leaves community im a couple days late from the actual one year mark but ive really been looking forward to the day that i get to this milestone. as a former grower in a medical cannabis dispensary and a hash makerprocessorpersonal grower in my own personal time i never thought i would live to see this day. from a half oz of flower or more plus several grams of concentrates and lots of mg of edibles ingested daily i thought i was stuck in a loop a cycle i could never break but i know im not the only one because this sub reddit showed me that regardless of what your situation and background are its possible to be in control of who you want to be. every day that i felt like smoking and everytime my friends were smoking around me i would scroll through the words of inspiration and wisdom from all of you guys. whether it was someone that was going through their first day or someone reaching their first year it all reminded me of why i wanted to stop in the first place and where i wanted to be in my future. without cannabis i wouldnt be who i am today and im somewhat thankful for what it provided me when i truly needed it but a fine line was crossed and i never stepped back from that line and i felt the need to quit. dependency is a risk that all of us have taken by habitually ingesting cannabis but breaking the dependency is something that is more than achieve able. thank you rleaves for being there for me when nobody in my life understood. from the early anxiety sweating irritability having dreams for the first time in 9 years nightmares and panic attacks to the urges to relapse and start all over or even just having someone to talk to and let them know that it really does get better. even though it wasnt easy i wouldnt have been able to get through this as easily without you guys thank you rleaves im forever grateful jared tldr i made it one year this community helps each other no matter what stage of the journey youre on leaves kicks ass,joy
ive noticed that when im smoking im more resentful i do not mean when im smoking as when im high just periods of time when im smoking nightly. being sober for a bit now i find myself able to interact positively with different people at work school and especially in my family that before i would find so anxiety inducing or hard to be around. i was often resentful of them such that i would be easily irritated by things they say or do. its such a good feeling the way it is now. its not that i suddenly love everything about them but simply that i recognize that im happier just accepting them for who they are instead of avoiding them or wishing they would change. especially regarding family acceptance is really important. if you are like me and have had a traumatic childhood such that your family is a reminder of it i believe that smoking that trauma away is what causes me to be resentful. thought maybe some people might relate to this.,anger
celebrating one year free today never thought id make it you can too,joy
i went on a date last night. one of the reasons i quit smoking was the effect it had on my relationships. i become a stereotypical lazy and apathetic stoner when i smoke and it turns out that girls are not really into people who do not give a fuck about anything. i went on a first date for the first time since quitting a month ago and it was amazing. i was present for the entire conversation i was witty i could show my sense of humor and carry on whatever we were talking about. we talked at a bar for 3 hours and by the time i got home she already sent a text asking when we were going out again. if i was stoned this simply would not have happened. i know this because ive gone on plenty of dates stoned or as a heavy user. i know the nervousness it would make me feel wondering what the hell should i say what will she think ect. everything has gotten better in my life when i choose to do things with a present mind. thanks for all the help and anecdotes others have shared here,fear
when i got sober i got a new life. it takes time to adjust. i need to be patient very patient. day 203 for me today. life is better and improving as my sober time grows. i have not been sober this long since i was 12. i am 54 now. i am learning to keep this in perspective. earlier in my sobriety i complained a lot. why ca not i sleep why am i feeling so out of sorts too much emotion too much crying i just want to feel normal i reflected a lot. this is a completely new situation for my mind and body. i literally have not been sober this long my entire teenage and adult years. how should i expect myself to even know what normal is how can i expect to feel stable so quickly after so many years of marijuana use its just not realistic. so here i am taking it day by day enjoying some progress but also suffering through the emotional release from so many years of dealing with it artificially. i am grounded in the knowledge that this is a new life and i am an infant in terms of sobriety so i have reduced my expectations and this has helped me a lot. i know this new life is the best life for me. the gravity of this new life is much greater than the gravity of marijuana.,joy
does anyone ever confuse chronic cannabis use with a mental disordersuch as depression before they quit i am not trying to deny myself the possibility that i might suffer from depression aside from my marijuana use but i am wondering if anyone here has ever while being a chronic user believed that they suffered from depression or anxiety until they quit weed like im wondering anyone has ever thought they had depressions but it was really just the effect of cannabis on their brain,sadness
made it through week 1,joy
a moment of realization as i date a stoner i quit a few months ago past the 90 days mark and ive decided to re enter the dating field. ive been dating this one stoner girl for two weeks now and while it does not tempt me to smoke when im around her man have i realized exactly what i was when i was high every day. weve hung out three times and she was sober each time great conversation etc and honestly it just feels natural. yesterday was our 4th time meeting up and she had just smoked she is a zombie after smoking both physically and mentally. her face had this expression that the lights were off upstairs and her conversation skills slowed down to the point where she could not contribute in a meaningful way to the conversation. a lot of head nodding and yeah ok got it etc. mainly the look on her face was the most disturbing here am physically talking to someone but upstairs mentallyno ones home. i saw herself in me before i quit. this is who i was a zombie. and just like her when not high were two very interesting people able to hold conversations and truly experience life when were social. it made me incredibly sad after i left yesterday thinking 1 i wouldve never had this realization if i was still smoking and neither will she and 2 how much of my life i wasted 10 years being a zombie. its frustrating knowing i will never get that time back. im certain ill have to break it off with her it hurts to grow close to someone and at the same time watch them devolve. im also not into chastizing others into quitting or changing their life for the better im a firm believer that you have to come into that realization on your own. it just sucks because i keep thinking about what if and the lost potential,joy
biggest benefit so far i am 3 weeks sober and the best thing about it after the first two weeks of not feeling great is that i no longer protect my nights and weekends so i can get high af and play word games alone on my phone. ive been out with friends every night this week and made plans for this weekend. i also feel much sharper at work and that feels amazing. i feel more confident and im loving life again. for anyone going through the first hard weeks hang in there it will get better ♥️,joy
a note on withdrawal symptoms tldr 4 weeks and you are physically back to normal i do not know if i should post this or if it is to trivial but here it goes. i struggled with withdrawal syndroms for about two weeks after quitting. anxiety depression extreme irritability i would strain not to lash out at my girlfriend sometimes thankfully not alot of sleep issues but still quite bad. especially the depression part made me want to start smoking again to make it all stop. what helped me was a paper i found when i googled for cannabis withdrawal syndroms it states that the cannabinoid receptors that are activated by thc and other cannabinoids in weed will desensitize during periods of regular use they talk about more than 3 times a week for a period of 6 months or more and this causes any physical and some psychological withdrawal symptoms. when you stop smoking they will start to normalize again and this process takes about 4 weeks with symptoms declining on average after 2 weeks. so anytime i found myself lying in bed and feeling like absolute dogshit i would tell myself give it at least four weeks and if you do not feel better then fuck everything and smoke again. now here i am at day 17 and i feel great. my mind is much clearer depression has mostly lifted again and the irritability is gone completely. so im glad i stuck with it and maybe some of you can take some solace when it gets hard during the first days or weeks. it will definitely get better and theres even scientific evidence for it edit this gained more attention than i expected so i just wanted to add something do not feel like something is wrong with you if depression anxiety or anything else that you experience after quitting lasts more than four weeks. this was only about physical differences in the body psychologically there is alot more going on and everyone is different quitting is the first step to self improvement and the things that it numbed might come back full force. but now you are able to take control over these things instead of repressing them so be brave and stay strong,joy
a clear coherent mind is truly worth fighting for. thats what i keep telling myself so i dont cave. im in the middle of day 2 without weed and its hard. only managed to get three hours of sleep at night and i cant sleep right now because of my adhd meds. just want it to wear off in hopes that the crash is enough to knock me the fuck out,joy
does anyone else tell themselves that theyre going to have one last hoorah and get super high and thats going to be it and then the next day you tell yourself the same thing and the next and the next i always tell myself okay this is going to be your last time. youre going to get super high smoke all your stuff and youre going to be done with it. plan on watching cool tv shows or new movie etc. etc. i always go back to the same shows but the next day ill go buy more stuff and its always the same thing its always tomorrow.,joy
when im high i tell myself i can live without this when im sober i crave marijuana like crazy. does this resonate with anyone else im 22 the first time i smoked was 17 but not regularly until i was about 19 or 20. maybe its just that the craving is sufficed when im high i do not know. what i do know is that its making stopping pretty difficult. im easing away gradually cold turkey is not an option for me. when im sober i am extremely anxious self loathing irritated and very unproductive. i feel like im in a constant state of panic basically. smoking usually eliminates some of the said feelings which always lead to me ending up caving in. some of the feelings when im high are lost or disoriented. when im high i can say no to another joint or that extra toke i can consciously say to myself this is enough i am done with this shit. thats a broken record to me though i ca not even think of all the times i told myself i would stop. if anyone else has had these kind of feelings what did you do to overcome them,sadness
taper taper taper taper also you should taper hey guys. ive been in this thread for a couple years just passively reading stuff. now ive quit myself and have some advice for yall albeit kind of obvious. ill preface this by saying ive smoked everyday for the last seven years. the last time i didnt smoke for more than 24 hours was when my baseball team made it to the state tournament my junior year of high school. i just graduated from college last month. there were points during my time in college where i would go through a gram of concentrates every day. now here i am 48 hours into quitting and i hardly notice that ive stopped. all it takes is slowly tapering to keep at least the physical symptoms of withdrawal at bay. when i decided to quit i was going through an eighth each day with an industrially large bong. the first week i cut down to just a few bowls a day. the next week one bowl during the day and one to go to bed. the following week half a bowl during the day and finish the bowl for bed. then i spent a week taking 1 2 hits per day when i really felt the need. two days ago was the last time i smoked and i slept like a baby each night since and have actually had a more normal appetite compared to while i was still smoking. if you are wondering why i quit there are many reasons its expensive i need to find a big boy job i admitted to myself that im simply not as sharp as i used to be smoking started to exacerbate my anxiety rather than provide relief from it my stamina in various sports is trash lately and i wanted to be able to travel without worrying about the cannabis laws in a particular place. i know tapering off marijuana may be easier said than done but if youre serious about quitting not becoming a nightmare its something to look into. it takes less effort to taper in my opinion than it does to lay in bed all night awake with cold sweats and an empty stomach. yall got this. edit i think the main reason tapering worked for me is that i suddenly started having anxious reactions to smoking and i slowly stopped seeing it as my safe haven. i totally see how tapering wouldnt work for others and i apologize if it sounds like im just telling everybody to do something impossible.,fear
this is how cannabis negatively affects me note to myself for the coming months of sobriety. more socially anxious than when sober heightened general anxiety cannot sleep without it brain fog forgetfulness lack of interest in general activities makes my adhd symptoms worse makes my ocd symptoms worse increases the chance i will eat and drink unhealthily poor quality of sleep daytime grogginess wasting money shorter concentration span than normal makes me more withdrawn and less social hinders my motivation to exercise and keep active increases bouts of depression lack of motivation messes up routines i dont dream when i sleep,fear
celebrating one year today. this is the last time. on this day last year i 30f quit marijuana for the final time. 11 years ago my brother passed away suddenly. i was 19 years old at the time having just started my sophomore year of college. i quickly went from being the bubbly cheerleader type to being a complete stoner as i self medicated. i had no idea how to deal with grief and trauma. none of my friends had gone through anything like this so i felt extremely alone. it didnt help that my school had a huge weed culture and i almost failed out of school several times. when i quit for the first time back then i had to deal with all the suppressed emotions which came flooding back. i got professional help from a therapist who helped me to accept my grief and guilt. i graduated with a horrible gpa but made it through nonetheless. after about four years of being cannabis free i thought it would be okay to smoke socially. at first it seemed to totally fine and it felt under control. when it became legal in my state things got worse and i got hooked on weed candies during a bout of depression. i was still functioning well so i continued to justify it but my anxiety and depression eventually got out of control as a result. today its been a year since ive used marijuana and i did it with he help of a therapist again. i am happier and more creative. i just want to acknowledge that this is a lifelong affliction and that youre never safe just because youve stopped smoking for an extended amount of time. i wouldnt have been able to quit again if it hadnt been for this sub thank you tldr started chronically smoking during a period of grief and successfully quit. thought it would be okay to start smoking socially again but it slowly spiraled out of control. hoping to warn others.,sadness
1 year guys,joy
8 days clean,joy
30 days tomorrow. at times i thought i was losing my mind. its been a challenging 29 days. today has been the best ive ever felt since quitting. im truly grateful i didnt give in to temptation because i certainly wanted to at times. i wanted to provide a check in of sorts a summary of what the past 30 days have been like. i posted here on day 1 of starting my sobriety worried about how to get rid of my apparatus vaporizer and accessories responsibly and im grateful to a poster who advised that hello youre dealing with addiction just get it out of your home. which i did. and had i not and kept it around in my home i dont know if id have been sober this whole time. at times i felt like i was coming out of my skin. its been hard. ive had childlike tantrums and meltdowns. and while i havent thrown things ive wanted to. i had a fantasy where i allowed myself to defiantly and violently smash all the dishes in my kitchen against the floor. there have been dark moments where i thought i didnt want to be alive anymore. ive noticed that as i complete week 4 im starting to feel human again in a good way. i woke up today curiously happy and genuinely upbeat. ive stayed the course despite experiencing instability at work — my division had layoffs last week and a major reorganization was announced. ive stayed the course despite being a caregiver to my husband who is recovering from major surgery. ive stayed the course despite having to search for and coordinate moving to a new home when our lease expires next month. i havent been exercising much during this time but over the past couple weeks ive adjusted my diet. nothing extreme just deleting anything with additives and instead eating very simple wholesome foods oats brown rice beans salads fruit etc. for me personally its been helpful to not have hyper palatable foods with additives messing with my brain. i have a calm steady energy which i appreciate. whats nice is to see within myself despite all the stresses in my life right now there is a core resiliency that i possess that i believe we all can access that i didnt give myself credit for. finally i want to add that ive also found simply being to be incredibly helpful. what i mean by this is finding a place to sit and be still and meditate. just sitting quietly eyes closed going within doing nothing. i would like to believe and perhaps validate for myself that what i was searching for by getting high was an illusion and perhaps i had it all along. its something im exploring anyway. im looking forward to the next 30 days of sobriety and i appreciate that this sub exists. reading other peoples experiences served as a mirror allowing me to accept and see the reality of cannabis and its impact on me.,joy
a comprehensive history of how pot helped to fck my late teensearly twenties and how i want to make it different from now on edit thank you all so much for the replies. i really did not expect this reception. this sub is absolutely great and i wish all of us much strength to get rid of the mental haze. my first experiences with weed were great. it was a novelty made me feel different expanded my thoughts ive always been inclined to philosophy and things like that. made me feel my mind was booming. this kind of feeling persists sometimes when i smoke today. but i believe this is all a big illusion. you do not need pot to be creative to have the ideas you have. you just have to sit with it and dedicate yourself when youre writing for instance. when i got into university i was very young at 17 years old. that was the second half of 2013. i smoked pot kinda often but it really was not such a big deal on my life. but when word came to the uni veterans that i was a pothead it instantly became an association people made with me. i remember my early semesters i would be 100 sober at campus and people would ask me if i was high and making jokes not like bullying friendly jokes about me being high and looking high im a quiet albeit sociable nerdy hippie dreamy type. it got to the point that it started to bother me. ca not people just look at me and see beyond that silly pothead persona that was imposed upon me im much more than that yknow. let me continue i started to hang out with the potheads at uni. ill be honest i made good friends at the pot circles in the hidden places at the campus. i really liked these inicial times. but the best part of it only lasted a semester or two. i was young did not care about much it was a discovery time lets see how it feels to watch that movieplay that game listen to that album while high etc etc. over some time i developed a daily habit of pot. in the first semester of 2014 i got a really interesting opportunity for an internship in some hipster enterprise that was starting regarding music and branding ive always loved music playing music etc. they did not have an office so i was supposed to work from home. it was really hypey and i had been chosen among many candidates even people older and more experienced than me. after i got the job and my first assignments can you guess what happened thats right i would just stay high at home play videogames and whenever i was supposed to do my job i would just lay down in bed and feel like shit. i was young i was silly my dad is an asshole that besides having abandoned me and my mother at a really young age beat me up really bad when i was 14 moms got no idea of discipline even for herself and my grandpa who was always a father to me had recently passed away so i had no one to help me to say that i was supposed to work instead of playing smoking and being a little shit all day. no one to say that i should have grabbed that opportunity and kept going. i basically just had a shitty performance at the first month and i left the job. the hipster entrepeneur guy who was the boss was really sarcastic with me and to this day i feel angry and sad everytime i hear about their agency or think about that time. angry at him for being an asshole but mostly at me for being such an irresponsible kid. after that things did not really get any better. after grandpa died which was a bit before all this job thing exactly the day after he died i started a relationship with a girl my friend had introduced me to in a house party. it was like fate just after losing someone so special to me she came into my life. to this day shes really important to me even though were not together anymore. ill call her g. g was a great girlfriend really understanding and caring. but there was a problem she was a really heavy drinker and cigarette smoker. as an anxious and sad young man i eventually became just like the fiend she was. wed go to clubs every weekend many times wed do it in the middle of the week get fucked up on alcohol and pot. soon she also introduced me to cocaine. i spent most of the time with g in her house smoking a lot drinking ordering chinese food watching things and making love. then wed find a party to go and meet her best friend who was the worst cocaine fiend of us 3 and one of the saddest creatures ive ever got to know. then the three of us would get really high and drunk and etc. 4 to 5 times a week. we were doing coke once every two weeks sometimes every week. me and g we were both lost souls unsatisfied with our subjects at university. she was a cinema student i was in advertising and absolutely hated it. but i did not really care i hated it. when i was not blinded in love with g in her house id be at my familys home smoking pot and playing counter strike with my buddies talking on skype. uni was easy enough ive always been a reader and theory and research were always natural to me so i excelled in difficult subjects while on the practical side of things i was gradually being left behind. you see all my colleagues in advertising were starting to choose their paths. some went to marketing some to video some went to graphic design. i just lurked around smoked joints and cigs and met with my friends. absolutely disconnected from the actual reason to be there. i hated all that fakeness and superficiality that governs the world of advertising plastic people plastic lives but i felt like i did not have anywhere to go. i did not want nothing. did not want to be anything. my depression was hitting really hard at that time. i had absolutely no idea of a future. around this time i had a course on music production which showed me a new path. but i had absolutely no discipline to compose at home or actually study the subject like it deserves to. that was basically how my life functioned from 2014 to around the first half of 2017. i eventually broke up with g. i left cocaine but i was still drinking and smoking both pot and cigarettes. i still felt the same way. at lost with no perspective of a future or a career. it was the beginning of a really depressing phase of my life. where i tried to get shit back together but just couldnt. i felt so lonely i ended up in a relationship with a girl who had many personal problems but she was not understanding like g. wed be locked up entire weekends inside a tiny apartment having really loud and absolutely pointless arguments. she even spat on my face. but i could not let go of her. my self esteem and mental sanity where absolutely rock bottom. i soon lost some friends because she did not like them. i spent a year dating this girl and working part time in a shitty public sector thing where id just play age of empires 2 all morning. at least it was inside the arts campus and i liked to hang out there. again my company was the pot and the booze and the cigs. after breaking up with this girl in the end of 2017 i started cycling a lot. it helped fight the anxiety and trauma. sometimes id cycle really fast and yell swear words. then i started to go to the bohemian district of town every night. i decided to not try to muffle my problems with relationships and love. i got out of the last one too traumatized. i had my bike and my independence after all. 2018 and 2019 i spent going to cheap pubs made a lot of friends on the street became kinda known in the street which is really funny. but yeah all of it cycled around getting high and drunk. i fell into cocaine again then back out. got a job with brand design in a renewable energy place. absolutely hated those burgeois shits. got kicked out because i just did not fit. then i started doing freelance graphic design for some friends clients. the income is pretty low and i constantly feel im being exploited. im paying the price of ignoring myself. im stuck to this fucking advertising industry. around the second half of 2019 i started to change my mind. i decided to quit drinking when i went out at night. and it started to work. going out became a thing about cycling and meeting my friends and not getting drunk. at the end of the year i vowed to live for myself and not ignore myself anymore. then covid 19 came. as horrible a situation as it is its been an opportunity for me. im proud to say ive been 20 days without nicotine and never want to go back to it have not got drunk in months and i am now dedicating myself fully to music and music production. im back in meditation as well doing it almost everyday and having insights about myself. but i still. smoke. weed. that goddamn weed. i know i have to stop. weeds been there sabotaging me and helping me sabotage myself for 7 years now. i want to remember what life is like without it. i need to thats why i decided yesterday was to be the last day i smoked weed. 42020. ill be strong. and ill change my life. thank you for reading.,anger
week 12 on vacation and a buddy had a jay normally i would be looking to sneak off and enjoy a puff. i can honestly say i did not feel the need to do so. with time it does get better i have no cravings anymore. this year is going to be great,joy
remind yourself it is actually a wonderful thing to stop smoking weed i wrote this as a comment on someone elses post but i felt like it warranted its own post. keep on setting the intention in yourself to quit and continually remind yourself that its actually a wonderful thing to stop. you might feel mad because you feel like youre missing out or in some way youre still attached to weed. find out where that attachment lies and what it is. for me i was attached to the feelings i would get from listening to music while high and that kept on sucking me back in. in the past i would be upset because i felt like i was missing out on the great feelings but reframe your perspective and it will be easier. the fact is youre here because some part of you feels like your life would be better without it. for me i had to seriously remind myself of all of the great opportunities and doorways that would open for me with sobriety. i thought of all of the things ive been missing out on from being high all the time. when you flip it on its head like that rather than feeling like youre missing out on getting high and seriously find a reason to rejoice in sobriety you are dissolving the attachment to weed. for me now when theres an urge or a thought comes up like oh i could get high right now i force myself to think no weed does nothing for me anymore. i have used every ounce of benefit from weed it has served its purpose. i no longer have anything to gain from weed but i have everything to gain from sobriety.i will gain clearer thought processes easier time socializing easier time planning and following through with what i truly want in my life i will gain self respect and a sense of accomplishment for finally doing what i know i must do. and by the time i remind myself of the fact that this is literally one of the greatest things i can be doing for me the urge is gone. because i evoke the legitimate emotion of rejoicing. and friend im sure you have used up weeds benefit long ago. youre here after all. this process of rejoicing is much easier than gritting your teeth and forcing yourself to stop when in the back of your mind you think youre still missing out on something. write yourself a list of all the things you gain from getting high and be honest. really see if theres something you think you still gain from it. then write a list of all the things you will gain from sobriety. i am only 9 days in this time around but it has been the most easy and even enjoyable process for me because i have solidified it in myself to look forward to a wonderful beautiful future for myself. for the record it took many many many attempts to quit for me. which is why i say continue to set the intention to quit and even if you slip set the intention again. it will click for you i promise. and as a side note since my attachment to music while high was a big one for me i was pleasantly surprised to see my emotional response to music skyrocketed rather than being half there stoned out of my mind trying to recreate the same feelings of when i first listened to music while stoned. if the attachment to some pleasure of media ie tv video games music is still there consider the fact that assuming youve been getting high for years it will actually be more pleasurable when youre sober. because thats the great news it will be. you will be refreshed and satisfied to see you will enjoy everything you enjoyed while high to an even higher degree. because you will be truly present with the media you like. best of luck much love and dont beat yourself up for failing. you will get this. you will get the life you deserve free of the insidious plant that has held you down for so long.,anger

wake up smoke weed again. hey im new to rleaves. im a 25 yr old cone head from nz. been smoking spliffs every day since i was 16. ive been thinking about my weed addiction for the last few years and finally mustered the courage to write about it. i thought it could be cool to share it here and see who shares my experience. its in a kind of corny poemsong format but the rhythm of it helped me get it out as opposed to writing it out like a diary entry or something. cheers i wake up smoke weed again. say hello to my old friend. same thing i do every day. yet those feelings do not go away. medicate what i do not understand. so i do not have to comprehend. what it takes for me to be a man. i say i ca not but i know i can. do not know why i approach life this way. change now and my problems go away. but somethings holding me in place. i think its the weed that i embrace. i sit back smoke weed again. im getting tired of this old friend. always makes me waste the day. as long as were together its ok. always with me its comforting. always stopping me from confronting my emotions so i chase the bliss. this is a feeling that i want to miss. i look back at myself judgingly. asking why i do not stop half jokingly. i know each day i smoke it holds me back. but im not racing why chase a stack. i lie down smoke weed again. im pissed off at my old friend. makes me awkward around my family. forget talking to someone new to me. id rather hang by myself theres nothing cooler. i tell myself that but whom i trying to fool here. i stare at the computer its glare calming me. i do not feel alone cause ive been smokin trees. if i get my shit together i can free myself. but im scared of asking my people for help. if i do it on my own that could be respectable. but that will take some work im a dope smoke receptacle. i close my eyes and smoke weed again. i ca not even look at my old friend. i blame him but i should be blaming me. for the shit i let it do to me. all my fault but i ca not live with that. so i light another spliff and play diplomat. just smoke until the end of this last bag. by the time i get there i forget the nag. im off to score again i know it looks bad. god i hope i do not see my dad. if he knew i do not know what that would do to me. but thats the same selfish thinking thats killing me. i wake up smoke weed again. say hello to my old friend. same thing i do every day. yet those feelings do not go away.,sadness
weed makes me feel okay about doing nothing with my life. im sick of being complacent. ive wasted the past 4 years of my life chasing the feeling of being high and its costed me so much. the longest ive been without marijuana in the past 4 years is 3 weeks ive forgotten what its like to have a mind that isnt clouded. i applaud those who are able to balance their lives with marijuana but ive come to the realization that im not one of those people. weed makes me dumb and forgetful. it makes me more inclined to indulge in porn and food. it makes me waste endless amounts of time doing nothing. it causes me to have problems with my girlfriend and it causes me to have problems with my parents. its held me back so much. i dont want to be held back anymore im so sick of living in this cycle. im so sick of saying im going to quit and not actually quitting. im so sick of being controlled by a plant. i dont need marijuana to be happy and i dont need marijuana to get through my day.,joy
had an argument with my mom and smashed my bong. im done. im new to this sub reddit so do not mind me. i started smoking in grade 11 in high school. it was a fun pastime for me and my friends until everyone graduated and started doing their own things. i still smoked regularly almost everyday after grad for a year and a half. it went from being fun to being a hassle. my parents are not fond of it and it brings up arguments. my girlfriend is also really against it which is another reason i wanna quit. i really love her and do not wanna lose my love and my family over this stupid vice. im beginning today after i had a spat with my mom which left her in tears and i felt responsible for that. so i took it into my own hands and shattered my bong. i was thinking of going to pick some up this morning but after the argument i wanna get my shit together. these last days ive been easily pretty angry and frustrated at having my family around me. ik its a really fucked up feeling and i want it to stop. i want my family back. i wanna be me again. thank you for reading all of this. some support will go a long way. stay strong 💪,anger
7 days sober and holy shit i missed being present. being emotionally available for people who need me at any time. not having to ignore a call because im too fried. human connection. also. i was an avid muncherlost 7 pounds since last week due to consistency in the gym healthy eating and i literally have barely felt like snacking. cooking for myself is a fun process not a drag. i feel high on life just by looking around at our beautiful earth and being present minded enough to realize how lucky we are to be able to experience life and how much i was keeping myself in the dark. i feel like myself again and i never want to be out of control of my actionstoo high to do fucking anything. even when i started a week ago i did not consider this recovery because that would mean i was an addict and who would want to be classified as that 7 days later and i seriously feel like baking myself a fucking 7 days sober cake because i am not worried about when the next time i am going to smoke is. it took me a few days without it to realize how much this drug controlled me and my whole daylife. i am trying to spread so much positivity into the world and with how productive i have been in just one week it really makes me sad that i wasted these last few years stoned instead of building myself up and living at my fullest potential. ohh the things i could have done ohh the things i know i am still capable of though i feel so on top of the world right now and i just wanted to share it with you all. life is seriously amazing guys. lets stop trying to escape it my mom passed away less than a year ago and she was the most important person in my life. i know things come up in life and you think smoking might temporarily help but it will be much worse to face your true heart down the road instead of taking care of them now. it feels so much better to feel pain than to not feel anything at all. life is seriously what you make it my mom would be so proud of me right now.,joy
still going strong it really does get easier just keep doing what you are doing👌👌,joy
over 1 year sober heres what i learned. not using a throwaway fuck it. im 19 but started smoking when i was 13. smoked daily multiple times a day from 14 18 and have now been sober from weed and darts since feb 2017. quitting smoking alone is not going to transform your life but it might transform your outlook on it. when i was a daily smoker i was doing so partly because it felt like being high was my normal state but also to help with my depression and anxiety. id wake up rip a bowl. spare period in school run outside rip a bowl id bring a bong to school alot. lunch rip a bowl. after school bowls. the worst part is that a lot of my friends were the same as me and our sessions were not even fun anymore. initially we all had so much fun and would laugh until we cried and then went out to get snacks but it just wasnt like that anymore. we just did it to feel normal again. i ca not speak for my friends but it felt like i was a walking zombie always tired with no motivation to do anything without caffeine. a ton of people recommend smoking to cope with depression which i can understand if youre using it as social lubricant in the right settings but after smoking weed for so long my relationship with weed and the way i felt while high was super unhealthy. i had this thing where i felt like i needed to smoke before anything food sex movie etc so i can maximize pleasure and i became obsessed with not wasting any moments. smoking weed in busy social settings started to make me stay in my head and make me paranoid whereas it used to make me sociable and fun to be around. i knew i would not have a good time going out if i smoked and i knew i could not resist smoking so i just stopped going out with friends. soon after my depression eating disorder and anxiety escalated to a point where i was unable to leave the house. i dropped out of school. girlfriend and i broke up. stopped seeing my friends. kept smoking weed. i gave up on my life. two suicide attempts later i decided to change. i ca not remember what sparked me wanting to change but i know it came in the middle of the night and that i grabbed that little spark of motivation and held onto it for dear life. i threw out the rest of my stash an ho mind you and decided to just try being sober for a while. i had no idea this sub existed and no one i knew would ever stop smoking so i did it alone. i took baby steps to fixing my life. i said first weed goes and the next week i stopped smoking cigarettes. the first 2 weeks were crazy difficult. every time a pang of depression hit i wanted to run to my bong and hit a batch bowl but i couldnt. i had no weed. so i kept myself busy. i started taking the gym seriously. started drawing again something i never thought i could do sober. tried to slowly fix my eating habits and bargaining with myself to try and be healthy. started reading books id put off and watched some anime on my to watch list. it was hard but i knew that if i could make it the first two weeks i could give it up. sure enough 2 weeks went by and ive made it this far 1 year and 1 month later. im currently finishing high school online and have been seeing girls again. your situations might be similar or drastically different than mine but i feel these takeaways as a product of my last year or so can help anyone struggling to quit. takeaways 1 keep yourself busy especially the first 2 weeks. it doesnt matter what youre doing as long as your able to throw yourself into it and keep your mind occupied. throw yourself into school into work into that hobby you neglected. read a good book spend time with your pets. when bad cravings hit youd much rather be busy than sitting on the couch flipping through netflix. if you also smoke tobacco they have a bad rep but fidget spinners helped me immensely. cravings may be especially bad in the evening after workschooletc so i highly recommend going for a walk or eating outsidegrocery shopping at night just to get you out of that headspace. 2 when bad cravings hit and youre not busy turn to physical excercise and cold water. this helps for quitting tobacco too. not everyone can just drop everything and go to the gym for an hour but if youre physically able do some pushups. get a pull up bar. do crunches and leg lifts abs recover fast so you can go hard every day. after youre done splash some cold water on your face. these two when done together wont magically cure your cravings but itll get your blood pumping and help you remember why you want to quit in the first place. 3 mental claritybrain fogdreams. for the longest time while smoking i could not remember my dreams. ive come to learn that cannabis suppresses rem sleep which is when you dream. rem sleep is incredibly important for your mental wellbeing and your health which is why a few days after quitting smoking youll get super intense vivid dreams. this is your body catching up on all of the lost rem sleep. if you previously relied on cannabis to fall asleep try waking up early exercising throughout the day reading before bed time taking small amounts of melatonin and sleeping in a cold completely dark room. if you ca not sleep get up and read until you feel ok to try again. over time your sleep gets better and you start to feel the fog lifting but it takes some time. 4if you are currently suffering from any sort of mental illness and using cannabis id highly suggest giving it up for good. after a few months of making better decisions getting good sleep and being sober i came to a place where i really enjoyed the peace of mind i have when im sober and i felt everything became easier to manage. i got off my benzos 6 months inno matter how bad it gets i refuse to take antidepressants and started to deal with my problems proactively instead or reacting to them with drugs. waning off benzos was even worse than coming off weed but i felt like i could push through it. i started to feel like i was not in such a dark place. things were looking up. if you have a therapist please speak to them about wanting to quit cannabis cold turkey. theyre able to help you in ways i ca not and can have super helpful insight. 5 relationships become much easier to manage with a clear head and newfound confidence. even if you suffer from anxiety try patching your relationship with your family even if your relationship with them is great. please note that by family i do not mean blood relatives. anyone who cares deeply about you is family. if you dont have any such people in your life yet this can be a great opportunity to reach out and make connections. tldr did not have a super long relationship with weed but am young enough for it to have an impact on my mind. after my life fell apart i quit smoking weed tobacco and taking benzos by exercising when cravings hit splashing cold water on my face and reaching out to people in my life. quitting is not easy but if one person took one thing away from this post id love for them to understand quitting is worth it.,joy
